                <p>AMBASSADOR WILLIAM H. GLEYSTEEN, JR.</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Thomas Stern</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: June 10, 1997</p>
                <p>Copyright 2000 ADST</p>
                <p>IMPORTANT NOTES FROM THE CONTRIBUTOR:</p>
                <p>1) Although Tom Stern, my colleague and interviewer, has only recorded a few of
                    his questions to identify chronological periods of my service, he actually asked
                    me endless questions at each session. All of them were thoughtfully prepared to
                    stimulate my responses.</p>
                <p>2) I must remind readers of this material that it represents my memory of events
                    and points of view, not necessarily the final verdict of history. My memories
                    need to be checked against those of other actors on the stage as well as against
                    the extensive documentation for this period.</p>
                <p>3) If readers wish to quote material from this “oral history” during my lifetime,
                    I request that they ask my permission before doing so. In addition, I must
                    remind users that they, not I, are responsible for making sure that the material
                    quoted is considered unclassified under U.S. Government regulations. Commenting
                    20-50 years after the events, I am relatively confident I have disclosed no
                    secrets, but the onus of making sure that I have not done so lies with users,
                    not with me.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Q: I am delighted to have this opportunity to talk to my old boss. We appreciate
                    greatly your willingness to participate in our Oral History project. Let me
                    start with the usual question: What is your background - birth, early childhood,
                    education, etc?</p>
                <p>GLEYSTEEN: Two obvious influence pushed me toward a Foreign Service career: being
                    raised in Asia and having parents with a very international point of view.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>I was born in Beijing (known to me as Peking), China in 1926 just before Chiang
                    Kai- shek and the Kuomintang briefly unified China. My parents were Presbyterian
                    missionaries. While my father was an ordained minister and my mother was also
                    very committed to her faith, they were professionals - school teachers, not
                    evangelists. For a number of years my father was the principal of a large
                    Chinese middle school for boys, which had a variety of self-help schemes
                    permitting bright but indigent students to attend. My parents were great
                    believers in the moral and practical virtues of physical labor for
                    intellectuals, a concept alien to the Chinese scholar class in those days.
                    Although it might have been better for me, I didn't attend the missionary
                    school. Along with most other Americans I was sent to the Peking American School
                    where I received an excellent education. Many of my fellow students were
                    Chinese, but the teachers were American and the language of instruction was
                    English.</p>
                <p>I was in China at the time of Pearl Harbor. The Japanese controlled Beijing,
                    having captured it in 1937, and we immediately fell under their control. After a
                    relatively brief period of house arrest, we were released to remain within the
                    city under rules that kept us apart from our Chinese acquaintances. About a year
                    later we were sent to an internment camp in Wei Xian, Shandong - a fairly rugged
                    experience. From there we were eventually repatriated to the U.S. - after a very
                    long voyage on a Japanese troop ship to Goa, India and then the Gripsholm to New
                    York by way of South Africa and Brazil.</p>
                <p>After getting back to the States in December 1943, I went to Westtown Friends
                    School in Pennsylvania for one term. Although I had missed most of my formal
                    high school education, I had been tutored by superb teachers and Westtown was
                    very generous in allowing me to graduate after one term. I was in the Navy for
                    about two years first as a V-12 student and then as an enlisted man. After the
                    war, I attended Yale, got a BA in 1949 and an MA in 1951 before going to work
                    for the Department of State. During summers I worked as a laborer to supplement
                    my meager financial resources at school. I was a merchant seaman in the summer
                    of 1947, exposing me during that contentious year to the Taft-Hartley Act and
                    the process of labor unions evicting communist elements within their ranks.</p>
                <p>There are several ways my childhood experiences influenced my career choice. My
                    parents were very dedicated to China, and I was taught that service to others -
                    secular as well as religious - was very important. These values were drilled
                    into me as they were into my brothers and sisters. China was a place that easily
                    evoked sympathy in the late 1930s and 1940s. It was poor and economically
                    backward, but the people were friendly, capable, and enjoyed a glorious
                    tradition - even if the old society had collapsed.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>I have especially strong memories about the period in the mid 1930s when I
                    suddenly began to comprehend what my parents were telling me about Japanese
                    aggression against China. I became very conscious of Chinese nationalism, which
                    I experienced vicariously through my Chinese friends. Having learned after the
                    event about the Japanese invasion of Manchuria in 1931, I was politically
                    conscious and saw the devastation when Japan attacked China proper in 1937. At a
                    young age I was convinced that the Chinese had been victimized by inexcusable
                    Japanese actions.</p>
                <p>Despite this powerfully negative view of Japanese behavior, I should note that I
                    was exposed to a variety of Japanese during my childhood, both in China and
                    Japan. We knew Japanese - particularly Christians - who were anti-military and
                    anti-war. Some of them visited China from time to time and came to see us. The
                    Japanese as a people were not demonized in my upbringing.</p>
                <p>Two foreign institutions in Beijing fascinated me in my childhood - probably
                    because of their privileged status. The first was a large detachment of U.S.
                    Marines, frequently mounted on Mongolian ponies for parades or polo. These
                    remnants of our colonial era were present during my whole childhood, and a
                    residual force was still present at the time of Pearl Harbor. The second was the
                    Foreign Service. My parents were acquainted with many of the American diplomats,
                    and most diplomatic children attended our school. Their lives looked opulent
                    compared to us poor missionary kids. Many Americans raised in China joined the
                    Foreign Service or the Marines. Some did both. Along with my brothers and
                    sisters I was indoctrinated with my parents' world view. My father and mother
                    made a great point of discussing international issues with us around the lunch
                    and dinner table. We talked about what Japan was doing to China, what Germany
                    was doing in Europe, etc. My father went to Geneva in 1932 to observe the League
                    of Nations debates on Japanese activities in Manchuria. Five years later he was
                    very disturbed by events in Europe and sensed war was coming. In 1939 we
                    traveled to Europe on the trans-Siberian railroad. Going through Stalin's Soviet
                    Union was an ugly experience (involving NKVD harassment, scenes of soldiers with
                    bayonets marching prisoners near the tracks, and other manifestations of a
                    police state) that left a deep imprint on my psyche. We visited Germany,
                    Holland, England, getting to the States one month before the Russo-German
                    invasion of Poland.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>By the time I went to Yale, I had pretty well decided that I wanted to get
                    involved in something related to international affairs, particularly some
                    activity that might benefit other human beings. Like many others of my age I was
                    enthused by what sometimes seemed to be heroic efforts in the post-war period to
                    construct international institutions, promote development, and (later) cope with
                    Cold War threats. Yet, at this point in my life, I was not focused on the
                    Foreign Service, and I was very depressed by events in East Asia. China was
                    being torn apart by civil war. I had been brought up as a child with a rather
                    benign view of Chiang Kai-shek and the Kuomintang revolution, so as a young man
                    I was particularly discouraged and disappointed by Chiang's corruption and
                    ineffectiveness. I had no romantic notions about the Communists. I saw their
                    assumption of power though a Cold War prism, not the more objective manner of my
                    later years. China seemed to be regressing from the goals that had energized my
                    family. Elsewhere in Asia I was disgusted by the efforts of the British, French,
                    and Dutch to reassert their colonial control.</p>
                <p>My strong reaction to these events led me to abandon East Asian affairs. At Yale,
                    I majored in European intellectual history and got my MA in international
                    relations. I did not return to Asian issues until toward the end of graduate
                    school. In the meantime, my older brother Culver had joined the Foreign Service.
                    He had already had very interesting experiences that tempted me. I also met a
                    number of Foreign Service officers in graduate school who impressed me by their
                    caliber. I had a professor of international relations (and master of Pierson
                    College at Yale where I lived), Arnold Wolfers, who was quite high on the
                    Foreign Service. My parents looked favorably on the Foreign service. The Foreign
                    Service and State Department enjoyed much prestige. However, no one lobbied me
                    or put any pressure on me during my slow drift into the Foreign Service by way
                    of the Civil Service.</p>
                <p>After getting my MA from Yale, I was still undecided about the “next step.” I had
                    in mind a job at the Department of State or a fellowship to continue my graduate
                    studies. When I naively asked Professor Wolfers to recommend me for both, he
                    told me quite properly that he would endorse me for one or the other but not
                    both. So I chose the State Department. I took and passed the Civil Service
                    Junior Management Exam, a standard test in those days for entry level
                    professional positions. But I was not bent on becoming a China or Asian
                    specialist when I started work in 1951 as a Civil Service clerk typist, GS-3, in
                    the Executive Secretariat, a temporary appointment to get me on the rolls - for
                    a salary of less than $3,000 a year!</p>
                <p>Q: When did you start in the Department and what were your duties?</p>
                <p>GLEYSTEEN: I started in March 1951. I was still in my anti-Asia mood. Although I
                    had relented a little bit by taking a refresher course in Chinese along with a
                    number of Asian related courses at Yale, I was still leery of becoming a Chinese
                    expert.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>I had a friend in the Department who told me that there was a vacancy in the
                    executive secretariat (S/S). I had also met with a number of people in INR, who
                    seemed interested in me. So I had a few choices; the secretariat sounded quite
                    interesting and in fact, my job did turn out be interesting from the start.</p>
                <p>I shared a small office with Richard Hennes, a friend who occasionally still
                    drops in on Washington. Our job was to summarize key documents for quick
                    reference. (I later found out that most of the material we were summarizing was
                    destined for Acheson's archives.) We also summarized cables for the “Digest”
                    that went to the president and the secretary every day. Our most awesome
                    responsibility was to review drafts of foreign policy speeches to insure
                    conformance with Administration policy. This function, which was created after
                    Truman and Acheson decided to squelch some of the more free-wheeling appointees,
                    at times put us in direct confrontation with very important people. Secretary
                    Acheson supported us when the official in question went over our heads to
                    complain. I greatly admired Acheson - more in those early years than later.</p>
                <p>I might note that I had little Foreign Service executive or management training
                    in my government career, with the possible exception of a year as a fellow at
                    Harvard University and the DCM course toward the end of my assailment as DCM in
                    Taipei. I just got thrown into the jobs. Of course, I learned on the job, but I
                    think I should have been required me to take a number of training courses.</p>
                <p>After about a year of summarizing and speech clearance, I was put “on the line”
                    in S/S, the equivalent in those days of today's Operations Center. By this time
                    John Foster Dulles had replaced Acheson. I saw a great deal more of him than I
                    had of Acheson, largely because I often went on trips with him.</p>
                <p>The secretariat went through a number of evolutions. In the early 1950s, its
                    basic function was to manage the paper flow to the seventh (actually fifth in my
                    days) floor principals, starting with the secretary. Later, by stages, S/S
                    became a 24-hour activity culminating in the elaborate Operations Center for
                    dealing with crises. During the years in the early 1950s when I was on the line
                    in S/S my main task was to review documents going to the secretary dealing with
                    East Asia and with NSC activities. I kept sensitive files, and I attended most
                    of the secretary's meetings with Walter Robertson and his staff as well as
                    NSC-related discussions centered around Bob Bowie, director of policy planning,
                    and the secretary. My impression is that S/S was probably more actively involved
                    in the decision-making process at that time than during my later service. We
                    were omni-present, although we rarely spoke up, unless there was a question
                    about the files and records.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>I still remember being annoyed by the length of some documents sent to the
                    principals, despite repeated warnings that the principals would not have time to
                    read them. I suspect the problem has become worse, not better, with modern
                    technology. The time consuming, cumbersome forms of producing memoranda in early
                    days encouraged some selectivity and care, while the computer and xerox seem to
                    have helped proliferate both paper and players in policy making. Of course, my
                    impression may be wrong. Bureaucracy has always been very wordy.</p>
                <p>When I first started in S/S, Carl Humelsine was the executive secretary. Luke
                    Battle was the special assistant to Acheson (followed by Rod O'Connor under
                    Dulles). After Humelsine, came Walter Scott to whom I reported for the rest of
                    my tour in S/S. Scott, who had been a colonel on Eisenhower's staff, was very
                    good to me. He pushed me to do things that I didn't think I could; I survived
                    and learned. Service with him was excellent training. In 1951, there were
                    probably ten officers in S/S. By the time I left four years later, there were
                    probably 25 or 30.Although I managed to graduate from it after a couple of
                    years, I found that producing the daily telegram digest for the secretary and
                    president was also good practice for later work. We had to go to work very
                    early; there was no time or possibility of revising or amending our work; and we
                    had to have a good typist who worked rapidly and accurately. On his first day as
                    president, Eisenhower personally opened the envelope containing the digest and
                    wanted to know why the hell the State Department was sending him “such a long
                    paper” - i.e. four single spaced pages. That was the end of the president's
                    digest, though a shorter product in big print was eventually developed for
                    him.</p>
                <p>Under Scott, our daily digests began to look very fancy - rather like the product
                    of today's laser printers. It was on our leaders' desks by 8 a.m. It was
                    horrible duty, but there was probably no better way to develop the skill of
                    swiftly squeezing out the essence of a document in as few words as possible.</p>
                <p>We worked in shifts - three or four weeks on early duty, three or four weeks on
                    regular duty. The days for this summary work were long. In theory, if we
                    reported for duty at 4 a.m., we were supposed to go home around 2 p.m., but we
                    rarely did that. I think we worked about 14 hours each day.</p>
                <p>Among my colleagues was Chris Van Hollen who later became an ambassador and whose
                    son is now a Maryland senator. There were many others who later rose in the
                    ranks. We had a mix of Foreign Service and Civil Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Duty in the secretariat was an eye opener, particularly for a newcomer. I liked
                    it; I was young and enjoyed being fully engaged. I didn't mind the long hours.
                    Also there was a general elan about foreign affairs at this time-the armistice
                    negotiations in Korea, the Japanese peace treaty, the establishment of NATO, the
                    unsuccessful attempt to establish the European Defense Community (EDC), etc. I
                    went to Europe with Dulles for meetings on a number of these issues. I felt
                    involved and that we and our allies were generally on the right path.</p>
                <p>McCarthyism was an ugly disease that struck the country during my S/S days. Since
                    my family had lived abroad, and specifically in China, I was in a category
                    subject to suspicion. Furthermore, I was married to the daughter of O. Edmund
                    Clubb, one of the prominent China officers pursued by McCarthy's witch hunt.
                    Although Clubb was exonerated in the final analysis, the process destroyed his
                    career and he resigned in disgust at a relatively young age. I also knew John
                    Davies-through my brother Culver; I did not know Service, but had a high regard
                    for him and most of the others.</p>
                <p>There were also allegations against me. They were eventually dismissed very
                    quickly but nevertheless caught me up in the dragnet cast by the State
                    Department's zealous security office in Dulles's time. I found the whole
                    McCarthy process deeply distasteful, to put it mildly. The casual assumption of
                    personal complicity because certain American citizens dealt professionally with
                    communists or focused on communist activities tore friends and families apart.
                    The careers of many outstanding officers were ruined. Although I escaped damage,
                    the McCarthy period was one of the most gruesome experiences I encountered. Even
                    after these many years, I still become emotional and angry about it.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Let me expand a little on my personal experience. As I said, I was interrogated
                    under klieg lights by our security office, primarily about any connections with
                    communist that I might have formed during my China days. Interestingly enough,
                    they chose not to question me extensively about Clubb. They had a fuzzy dossier
                    on me - I was guilty of being born abroad, in China moreover, I was acquainted
                    with a number of “suspicious” people, and I behaved strangely, for example
                    reading the Communist “Daily Worker” newspaper in the Philadelphia Public
                    Library. In fact, I had done so at the suggestion of a very conservative
                    anti-communist professor for a “content analysis” paper required in his course
                    at Yale. My brother Ted, who had once worked for the FBI, warned me about
                    undertaking this project, predicting it would get me into a lot of trouble. And
                    he was right. The dossier also noted my alleged sympathy for the communists
                    during my Yale days. This was stimulated by a talk I gave to a U.S. Army reserve
                    unit in New Haven while I was a graduate student. I made some disparaging
                    comments about South Korean President Syngman Rhee, stating that when I first
                    learned the Korean War had broken out I was not initially certain whether the
                    provocation had come from the South or North, although it soon became obvious by
                    the massive attack that North Korea was the aggressor. Some time later in a New
                    Haven bar I ran into an army reserve officer who had been in the audience. Quite
                    drunk and failing to recognize me as the speaker, he described to me the
                    terrible talk I had given and branded it as pro-communist. Presumably, he
                    reported that to Army intelligence which passed it on to the State Department's
                    security apparatus. The most amusing accusation was that I had been the leader
                    of a Chinese communist guerrilla unit during WW II. I pointed out that I would
                    have been rather young for such activity.</p>
                <p>These and other equally baseless allegations were left to fester in my dossier
                    without analysis and then took on significance in the McCarthy period. I had
                    been given security clearance in 1951 so that I could join the Department, and I
                    also had no problems obtaining renewed clearance when I was “Wristonized” into
                    the Foreign Service in 1954. But for some reason the allegations against me were
                    given sufficient weight to bar me from a foreign assignment. In 1955, while I
                    was awaiting assignment to the Chinese language school in Taiwan and wondering
                    why the assignment was not finalized, I learned from my boss, Walter Scott, that
                    it was my security dossier that kept me from being assigned overseas. I told
                    Scott the clearance issue had to be resolved immediately or I would be forced to
                    find other employment. He agreed with me. In fact, I was interrogated one
                    afternoon and had my clearance 36 hours later.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Apart from my obvious personal revulsion, I think “McCarthyism” damaged the
                    effectiveness of the Department of State more than most people realize. Many of
                    the best China experts that the department had were either discharged or
                    sidetracked into non- China related work. This deprived China affairs of some
                    very smart, even brilliant people. Even worse, an aura of what today might be
                    called “political correctness” permeated the department, resulting in caution of
                    expression and considerable intellectual cowardice. For example, when I was
                    assigned to our embassy in Taipei in 1956, I found the political section
                    appalling. It was so conservative, so cautious, so wedded to the safe path, that
                    its intellectual contribution to US policy making was almost nil. This was the
                    most unfortunate legacy of the McCarthy era. Any bureaucracy finds it difficult
                    to consider new approaches - much less take them - and when that is combined
                    with fear you have an unthinking institution.</p>
                <p>It wasn't all bad. I was able to speak my mind on the issue. My superiors didn't
                    treat me as a pariah while I was under investigation. Dulles' views on the
                    matter were quite different from mine but I was given increasing
                    responsibilities under him. With the exception of Walter Robertson, who was a
                    McCarthyite in gentleman's disguise, most of the assistant secretaries were, in
                    my opinion, on the side of the angels. I especially remember Livingston Merchant
                    in EUR, Henry Byroad in NEA and Bob Bowie in Policy Planning. Despite my
                    distaste for Robertson in almost every respect, he had good deputies, including
                    Alex Johnson. During my trips with the secretary, I had an opportunity to
                    discuss the Department's condition with people like Merchant. They may not have
                    agreed with my views entirely, but I found it reassuring that these people one
                    level below the secretary were civilized.</p>
                <p>As I recall, my first trip abroad, certainly my first trip to Asia, while in S/S
                    was to a SEATO Ministerial meeting held in Bangkok - in 1953. The coordinator
                    for this trip was Douglas MacArthur II - then the counselor of the department
                    and later my ambassador in Japan. I had a friendly relationship with him; he was
                    well connected and therefore was able to get things done. Although the
                    conference was considered successful, I felt SEATO was founded on illusions.
                    Later, I went to Europe with Secretary Dulles several times, primarily to NATO
                    meetings in London and Paris. My longest trip was the Geneva conference in 1954
                    on Korea and Indochina. I stayed on in Geneva for more than two months and only
                    left because things seemed stalemated; I missed the final action dividing
                    Vietnam that took place a couple of weeks after my departure.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Dulles traveled with a rather small group of aides. He had two persons from the
                    secretariat - one administrative officer and one substantive officer like
                    myself. I was essentially the person responsible for assuring that the secretary
                    saw all the important messages. I discovered during the Geneva conference,
                    however, that there were critically important messages not shown to me - a
                    system that I found troubling. In particular I was not aware of discussions with
                    the British and French about possible air strikes and other measures to rescue
                    the French at Dien Bien Phu. These were “back channel” messages involving
                    Eisenhower's talks with prime ministers. I later came to appreciate the need for
                    restrictions, but I was disheartened at the time, because I thought I was part
                    of the inner team. My ignorance was brief; back in the department after I
                    returned from Geneva I had access to almost everything as I assembled the record
                    of the meetings.</p>
                <p>In addition to the secretariat staff, Dulles would have Rod O'Connor, his
                    personal assistant, and his secretary. The rest of the traveling group consisted
                    of officers designated by the relevant assistant secretaries to accompany the
                    secretary. The coordinator of the trip and a couple of his assistants would go
                    in advance. Additional officers would go with the Secretary on his government
                    plane; some would precede him-as I did-and others might follow as their
                    expertise was required. It was not a huge operation.</p>
                <p>In Geneva, I attended many sessions of the conference as I did at SEATO. I
                    sometimes attended small meetings as the US note taker. That was not a normal
                    function for a secretariat officer; I became involved by sheer happenstance.</p>
                <p>I had an interesting reaction to Dulles. First of all, I had a slightly
                    worshipful - probably somewhat excessive-view of Acheson that may have made me
                    more severe than justified in my judgement of his successor. Secondly, my
                    newspaper acquaintance with Dulles before he became secretary was of a man of
                    baffling contradiction. While visiting Korea in 1950 before the outbreak of the
                    Korean War he seemed to demonstrate commendable caution about the danger of
                    South Korean provocative actions; yet he later appeared to have become a hawk in
                    suggesting we use nuclear weapons to break the military stalemate. Whatever the
                    facts, I worried that he was a hardliner. Lastly, Dulles' mannerisms were
                    remarkably unattractive; he was not a polished figure like his brother Allen.
                    John Foster was physically clumsy-he was tall and gangly; he was abrupt; he
                    didn't pay much attention to his surroundings; he was very demanding of
                    people.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>So my first impression of Dulles was rather negative, the views of a fairly
                    “liberal” anti-communist Democrat, working in a very Republican administration.
                    But I generally measure people on how they perform and over time, and my opinion
                    of Dulles rose measurably. Initially, I feared he was an adventurer; he sided
                    with the military in several debates concerning the development and use of
                    nuclear weapons. In the secretary's and deputy secretary's offices during
                    meetings and phone conversations I listened to the arguments dealing with China;
                    I was appalled. Bedell Smith, a fine soldier and good deputy also disappointed
                    me by siding with Dulles. Fortunately, President Eisenhower had the sense to
                    toss out an almost unanimous State and Defense recommendation to use nuclear
                    weapons. This aspect of Dulles jolted me, but as time went on, my anxieties
                    diminished.</p>
                <p>I came to see Dulles as a very hard worker. He was not so ideological that he
                    turned deaf ears to important information. He listened to people. Although it
                    was not easy to see him, once you got to him, your views would get an airing. I
                    think Dulles acted on a fairly broad spectrum of information and views.
                    Periodically he would return to his menacing “Cold Warrior” style, but President
                    Eisenhower seemed to balance that off very well. My opinion of Dulles was more
                    favorable at the end of my tour than it was at beginning.Dulles barely
                    recognized my presence; he was very impersonal to all. He knew I was a member of
                    his outer staff and treated me decently. I dealt mostly with him through Rod
                    O'Connor with whom I had a very good relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>I have one story - both amusing and disturbing - about my relationship to Dulles.
                    During one of the off-shore island crises with China - before the well known
                    Chinmen and Matsu crisis in 1958 - the PRC (The People's Republic of China) and
                    Nationalist Chinese had been exchanging artillery fire back and forth in some
                    small islands in the Taiwan Straits, the Da Chen islands, as I recall. We
                    intervened, moving Seventh Fleet ships to the vicinity to deter the mainlanders
                    and eventually evacuate the Nationalists. In the process we demanded the
                    Nationalists cease firing unless fired on. A truce of sorts developed after
                    tough negotiations with President Chiang Kai-shek. I was following the crisis
                    closely. While Dulles was in Europe, the Nationalists resumed shelling and the
                    Communists responded, so that we had renewed hostilities - although at a
                    relatively low level. In a meeting with the assistant secretaries in preparation
                    for an NSC meeting, Dulles asked Robertson whether the truce had held. Robertson
                    assured him that the Nationalists had behaved. In the back benches I created a
                    stir by letting everyone know Robertson was wrong. I think it was Bowie who
                    urged me to speak up. In any event I finally raised my hand - very much like a
                    school boy. Dulles recognized me and I disputed Robertson's answer, giving the
                    facts, which were in a memorandum already sent to the secretary. Robertson was
                    furious and when I stuck to my guns mentioning the memorandum, Dulles asked
                    O'Connor to check, which he did promptly and confirmed my account. Dulles
                    grumbled an acknowledgment. Bowie, Byroad and Merchant were amused, while
                    Robertson was fit to be tied. The issue was not a minor one since several
                    admirals were in favor of using nuclear weapons against the Chinese. I was
                    baffled by Robertson's behavior. He was too involved to have been ignorant; he
                    wasn't stupid. He must have been suffering from a powerful compulsion to protect
                    his pals in Taipei. O'Connor told me I was lucky to have been right and laughed;
                    Robertson did not talk to me for a month; but my good relationships with his
                    staff in EA continued without noticeable damage.</p>
                <p>My attendance at the SEATO ministerial and Geneva meetings generated some
                    prejudices in me about international conferences, reinforced perhaps by my
                    second-hand observation of the negotiations for the Korean War armistice, the
                    peace and security treaties with Japan as well our treaties with Taiwan and
                    Korea. International conferences with their opportunities for high level contact
                    were more important in the 1950s and 1960s than they are today when there are so
                    many venues for personal contact. Now, international conferences are a debased
                    currency. In my time in the secretariat, high level international meetings were
                    rather rare and therefore targeted on critically important matters. Now, they
                    are routine, often very large and frequently frivolous. Their cumbersome size
                    was a drawback in those days, and remains so today.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>I found conference preparations very tedious. I was quite cynical about the
                    amount of paper produced by the bureaus and offices; that was particularly true
                    for the Geneva conference where in my S/S capacity I had to read every paper
                    from beginning to end. I knew that the Secretary and his senior assistants would
                    never read most of these documents. Many were not worth reading; quite a few
                    were prepared to fill arbitrary briefing book requirements. Even with all this
                    paper flow, there was not enough attention paid to contingency situations which,
                    for example, dominated at Geneva. Some important papers on critical policy
                    issues were warped by the kind of ideological posturing that obstructed
                    communication with our adversaries. The extremes of these papers were reflected
                    in Dulles' refusal to shake the hand Zhou Enlai extended to him or to
                    communicate directly with the Chinese. Not only did we demonized the Chinese to
                    our own disadvantage but we also complicated our dealings with the Soviets.
                    Today, of course, we have better means of communicating with both countries, but
                    we still like to demonize our adversaries.</p>
                <p>My tour in S/S left a strong impression on me; not only was I privy to the
                    decision making process but there was a kind of excitement - for example, the
                    chance to see people like Churchill as well as large numbers of foreign leaders.
                    Nevertheless, much of the activity was highly frustrating. There were many
                    failures. The Geneva conference in essence failed in both Korea and Indochina. A
                    lot of the NATO meetings were non-productive, even while the organization grew.
                    Efforts to create a European Defense Community as a means of bonding Germany
                    into Europe failed, because of a succession of weak French governments. SEATO
                    was a doubtful proposition from its very birth.</p>
                <p>In addition to the secretary, S/S served the deputy secretary (then known as the
                    under secretary), and the under secretary for political affairs. S/S may have
                    also provided support for the economic under secretary, but my brief did not
                    cover economic issues. I saw Bedell Smith quite often, particularly before,
                    during, and after the Geneva conference. Again friendship with a special
                    assistant facilitated the process. I had a very high regard for Smith, in part
                    because he was qualified and willing to stand up to Dulles. I watched Robert
                    Murphy from afar in meetings. He occasionally would ask me something, but all
                    three principals treated me like the publisher of a very useful publication.
                    They knew that I was very familiar with documents; I could be counted on for
                    information. But they never asked me for advice or my views, with very few
                    exceptions. When the director and deputy of S/S were away, we had a system of
                    rotating their responsibilities among the more senior S/S officers, involving
                    more direct contact with our principal. We had no night shift, but we had 24
                    hour coverage of cables; if something urgent popped up, the communicator was
                    supposed to call the home of the designated S/S officer who had to decide what
                    to do next. We occasionally decided to come down to the department to read the
                    message.</p>
                <p>After four years in S/S, having watched the foreign policy process, both as a
                    participant and an observer, I was impressed first by the degree to which the
                    president dominated the process in the 1950s. Once he made a decision, the
                    system reacted quickly. Both Truman and Eisenhower were decisive. And that
                    seemed true of their staffs as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Secondly, I had a feeling that the executive branch, for the most part, was
                    filled with well qualified, capable and in many cases, admirable people. Of
                    course, the law of averages necessitated that there be some fools in the ranks.
                    While responsible for speech clearance, I met a number of them, particularly the
                    military service secretaries. But most of the people for whom I cleared
                    speeches, were sensible. Overall, I had a favorable impression of the
                    bureaucracy, which I am less certain of today.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, Congress was more coherent then it is today. It was more dependent on
                    the president and its own leadership - in both parties. I saw different kinds of
                    Congresses, but I saw a Democratic president working with a Republican Congress
                    and vice-versa. I came to appreciate the importance of Senate and House
                    leadership. Their support was crucial - unlike today with authority dispersed
                    through so many committees and sub-committees. That leadership was also very
                    decisive. If you had a president who could make decisions and who had the
                    ability to convince the congressional leadership, the main remaining task was to
                    convince the public. I thought this top-down approach was the way a democracy
                    should work. Today I sense a dispersal of power and greater degree of populism.
                    Presidents fail to shape policies with the clarity that I saw in the 1950s.
                    Congress has acquired far more power and is all over the place with agendas set
                    by ambitious staffers. Bureaucrats seem to have more hidden personal agendas and
                    less interest in the “better good” for the nation.</p>
                <p>I recognize I am not being entirely fair in this judgment; it is not a clear cut
                    issue; it is often just a matter of shading. However, today's atmosphere makes
                    me pessimistic about our ability to solve some of today's major issues. Clinton,
                    in my mind, has carried public speech to such a level that it is almost
                    meaningless. In the 1950s, there were relatively very few speeches on foreign
                    policy; when they were given, they tended to be important - to announce new
                    policies or prepare the public for new initiatives. They were meaningful to the
                    public and the bureaucracy. Now, they are commonplace and boring.</p>
                <p>In general, I had few situations in S/S where required information was not
                    available to me. At that time I didn't handle certain categories of classified
                    material-e.g. nuclear - because I didn't have the appropriate clearances. I
                    accepted that. I knew that department leadership was getting the very sensitive
                    material-I saw them receiving it and I could tell whence it came. That didn't
                    bother me and I did not think that such compartmentalization impeded the
                    decision making process.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Sometimes, we had a problem when not all of the involved people had access to
                    conventional sources of information. S/S, in those days, was a prestigious
                    organization; we used the Secretary's authority to force a bureau to share its
                    information with other bureaus, as appropriate. For example, EUR officers not
                    infrequently discussed the future of Vietnam with the French without letting EA
                    know. That could affect policy making, because EUR tended to be more sympathetic
                    than EA about European efforts to reassert control over their former colonies in
                    Asia and Africa - in my opinion, to the great detriment of the US. The
                    Department in the 1950s was still very Euro-centric. Would the participation of
                    EA have prevented the catastrophes? Probably not, but it might have helped if EA
                    had known about certain nefarious activities earlier. This fault in the system
                    also deprived the Secretary of obtaining views from a broader range of
                    advisors.</p>
                <p>I must say that the bureaus were often annoyed with us and sometimes complained
                    bitterly. But we were almost always supported by our principals. We could not
                    stop reports that did not require clearances or activities that did not involve
                    the secretary and the under secretaries - nor should that have been in our
                    charter. We were right, however, to struggle against compartmentalization that
                    threatened to warp our policy decisions.</p>
                <p>In conclusion, I thought that the S/S staff was a group of good people. I was the
                    only one who later (much later) ended up in EA. I respected their qualifications
                    and personalities. I thought that the system worked rather well. It went through
                    a lot of reinventing of the wheel. Our operations were studied, sometimes by
                    outside experts. We were reorganized twice during my four years. We in fact were
                    moving quickly towards what S/S is today, which in retrospect, was a wise move.
                    I think our standing in the department was higher in the 1950s than it is today,
                    in part because the department was much smaller. There were fewer assistant
                    secretaries and a more collegial atmosphere. For me, as a newcomer to
                    government, it was an extraordinary experience. I was very lucky. The
                    opportunity to be a “fly on the wall” of the bosses was priceless.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1955, you were assigned to the language school in
                        Taipei. Hodid come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLEYSTEEN: I was “Wristonized” in 1954-55. I was not unhappy by the prospects of
                    joining the Foreign Service. In fact, the process went very smoothly. I worried
                    that some Foreign Service officers might resent my joining the ranks by way of
                    the Civil Service, but I came across no apparent animosity. In the long run, I
                    don't think Wristonization of civil servants hurt the officers who entered the
                    Service through the regular examination process. I transferred at about the same
                    pay level as in the Civil Service: GS-11 to FSO-5 (later reclassified to
                    FS0-7).</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>About the same time I saw an advertisement seeking applications from officers who
                    were interested in becoming Chinese language officers through a difficult
                    languages program. I put my name in, and I soon found myself in the first class
                    of the Chinese language school that had just resumed operations in Taichung,
                    Taiwan, having been dormant from the time the Communists captured Beijing in
                    1949.</p>
                <p>I spoke ordinary Chinese quite fluently, but I was only semi-literate. While I
                    knew some characters, I could not read a newspaper or a novel. I had grown up
                    bilingual in English and spoken Chinese and this enabled me to cover the full
                    language course in about one year, less than half the time that a non-Chinese
                    speaker would have taken. I graduated with a high rating-good enough to
                    interpret informally in both directions.</p>
                <p>There must have been seven or eight of us at the Chinese language school. Over
                    half were from the Foreign Service; the others belonged to other agencies-USIA,
                    CIA, and Defense. We had to work in makeshift quarters in a rented house. My
                    classroom was a kitchen; there was no furniture so that we sat on the floor
                    until simple furniture finally arrived. By the time I left, the school had
                    appropriate class rooms and adequate furnishings.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of comradery among us. We studied hard for long days for many
                    weeks. Then we would on occasion indulge ourselves - sometimes at a resort and
                    some of us drinking too much. That cemented friendships. We had close relations
                    with our teachers; we lived as a small community. Among my colleagues-most of
                    them married-in the first class were Paul Popple (deceased), Bill Thomas, Paul
                    Kreisberg (deceased), Harold Champeau, Frank Burnett, Jim Elliot, and Randy
                    Raven. David Dean arrived about the time I left. Most of them were newcomers to
                    Chinese language. In general, I think the course was very good. FSI did a first
                    class job in reopening that language school. I well remember how hard I
                    worked-sixteen hours each day. I wanted to raise my level of comprehension so I
                    would be able to navigate well in Chinese, and I wanted that done sooner rather
                    than later. The extra hours helped me graduate after the first year. If I had
                    not spoken the language as a child and if I had not had brushed up at Yale, I
                    would have had a much more difficult time.</p>
                <p>The faculty was locally hired. Nicholas Bodman was the first head of the school.
                    He was an established linguist -although with little knowledge of Chinese and
                    somewhat impractical. Despite some criticism of his performance and lots of
                    practical problems, he successfully managed to revive the school. He was
                    replaced by Gerald Cox.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>I learned Mandarin which is the Chinese dialect that we generally use in our
                    discussions and negotiations. I think we were pig-headed in limiting ourselves
                    to Mandarin, largely because that was what our teachers thought we should be
                    taught. It suited me, of course, because Mandarin was the dialect I learned as a
                    boy, and it was the national language in both the PRC and Taiwan. But the
                    reality is that dialects are used extensively in both places. It would have been
                    very useful to have officers fluent-or close to it-in both dialects. It would
                    have helped me in both my first and second tours on Taiwan - even though it
                    might have resulted in a greater emphasis on the China area in my future career.
                    I recognize practical limitations, particularly finding the extra time to study
                    a dialect.</p>
                <p>At the end of my training I was assigned to the Political Section in Embassy
                    Taipei. The political counselor, Paul Meyer, invited me and my wife to Taipei
                    for an interview and dinner. He was a friend of my wife's family, having been a
                    colleague of Edmund Clubb. After a very pleasant evening with the Meyers, I
                    learned a few weeks later that he arranged with the ambassador to have me
                    shifted to the consular section, because he decided my views were out of line
                    with embassy thinking. Indeed, they were! So I was shuffled off to the consular
                    section without training, reporting to a wonderful, almost always drunken
                    consular veteran who gave me an abbreviated version of the consular course.</p>
                <p>I spent six months in the consular Section. I never regretted the assignment; it
                    was good experience. I was a bit disappointed about being diverted from the
                    political Section, but I thought officers should have broad experience in their
                    younger years, including consular work. I learned a lot in the consular section
                    - how to issue visas, how to interview people, the complications of immigration
                    issues, etc.. There were just two officers in the section, so that my exposure
                    to the various aspects of consular work was quite wide. I also was able to use
                    my language skills quite frequently-much more than if I had been in any other
                    section of the embassy. I usually did my own interviews without the help of a
                    translator.</p>
                <p>While in the consular section, I worked on both non-immigrant and immigrant visas
                    as well as services to Americans - including protection and passports. In the
                    mid-1950s, Congress authorized a vast increase in the Chinese immigrant quota.
                    The new law allowed people who were refugees from the mainland, who could make a
                    case, to immigrate to the US along with their families. Most of these people
                    were in Hong Kong, but there were also some in Taiwan. A special consular
                    section staffed by State and INS was established in a different building to
                    handle this work-load. By the time I got to Taipei this special program was
                    coming to an end. The residual work fell to the consular section, giving me some
                    exposure to many of the applicants. Some, like Anna Chennault, struck me as
                    hardly fitting the definition of refugee. I didn't have much sympathy for them.
                    Incidentally, Chennault later managed to wangle a visa from someone else.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>I refused quite a few applications, both for immigrant and non-immigrant visas. I
                    was reversed in a few cases by the DCM, James Pilcher. I told him it was not his
                    business, and I made sure that he, rather than I, signed such visas and that his
                    action was noted in the files. All of those cases were matters of political
                    favoritism - a not uncommon practice. My genial boss was more willing to bend
                    than I. In the process I learned a negative lesson, and throughout my career I
                    tried not to pressure decisions by consular officers.</p>
                <p>My first ambassador was Karl Rankin. He was succeeded by Everett F. Drumright in
                    1958. The DCM for my whole tour was Jimmy Pilcher, who just died recently. He
                    knew little about substance but had considerable experience as a senior consular
                    officer, including a feel for management. He had served in China, but was not a
                    language officer; I felt his principal agenda was to get along with people,
                    especially the ambassador and the Chinese in Chiang Kai-shek's regime. Rankin
                    was a newcomer to the Chinese scene who had distinguished himself in emergency
                    relief activities and Cold War operations in Greece. He became our ambassador at
                    the peak of our confrontation with the PRC, and he was very ideological about
                    Communists - Greek or Chinese, they were all the same to him. Pilcher echoed
                    him.</p>
                <p>Drumright, on the other hand, was a China expert, a language officer with several
                    tours in China. He had been DCM in Korea during the Korean war and had held a
                    number of senior positions in EA area. Although liked personally by most of his
                    colleagues from China days, some thought he was over his head as ambassador. I
                    don't entirely share their uncharitable view, after seeing the variety of
                    characters appointed to ambassadorial positions. Drumright may not have been
                    brilliant, but he was an improvement over Rankin; he had a better grasp of the
                    Chinese situation and reality. He was only slightly more moderate.</p>
                <p>About this time I was promoted on the basis on my performance at the language
                    school-a rare occurrence designed to encourage study of difficult languages. I
                    was surprised and delighted but it made me senior to my boss. To solve that
                    problem I was moved to the economic section, which might have happened in any
                    case. Joe Yager, a strong officer and friend, was the economic counselor for the
                    major part of my two year plus tour. He later succeeded Pilcher as DCM.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>I had only been exposed to basic economics at Yale. That was not much of a
                    hindrance. My job didn't require fancy training. Essentially, I took care of
                    issues that did not fall clearly within the responsibilities of the other
                    officers. I was responsible for agriculture, which turned out to be a very
                    important function because the Nationalist government had reorganized itself on
                    retreating to Taiwan, making land reform and agricultural development show cases
                    for aid purposes. These efforts were managed by the Joint Commission for Rural
                    Reform (JCRR), which was one of my liaison responsibilities. I got to know
                    certain officials of this agency well. The present president of Taiwan, Lee
                    Teng-hui, was an agronomist and deputy secretary general of the organization,
                    which was a joint American-Chinese enterprise; its commissioners represented
                    both countries, although by the time I started my job Americans were being
                    phased out.</p>
                <p>I attended the commission's staff meetings. The secretary general was a member of
                    the Kuomintang Central Committee. My language comprehension came in handy. There
                    were occasions when the Chinese commissioners and staff would argue in Chinese
                    sometimes in order to shut out the Americans present - the commissioner, the
                    head of US AID, etc. I could follow the debate, which often proved to be quite
                    interesting. I reported what I had heard to both my boss and the political
                    section.</p>
                <p>I shared the commercial work with another officer. During my last year, Yager
                    allowed me to work on specific projects. I wrote a big report on the forest
                    industry in Taiwan. I had the benefit of very important help from one of our
                    forestry experts and others in AID. My analysis showed that the very expensive
                    assistance we were providing to the forestry industry was being used to sustain
                    a badly run government monopoly designed to keep prices high as a source of
                    revenue with little regard to forest regeneration. Soon thereafter, our
                    assistance was terminated. I was told my report played a role.</p>
                <p>Although Drumright was willing to listen to different views, he was
                    unquestionably a hardliner. To make matter worse, we lacked challenging minds in
                    the upper echelons of the embassy's political structure. Paul Meyer, the
                    political counselor was not qualified for his important position even though he
                    was a Chinese language officer and had served in China. Whether from conviction
                    or because he thought his bosses would applaud his views, he was an
                    unimaginative, unmitigated Cold Warrior who literally censored all attempts to
                    criticize Chiang's regime or deal objectively with Communist China. He had some
                    good political officers under him, whom he kept bottled up doing routine chores.
                    With Joe Yager's collusion, I cheated a little bit to compensate for Meyer. I
                    inserted a good deal of political analysis into the economic section's weekly
                    and monthly reporting. There were occasions when we got bleats from Meyer,
                    because we didn't clear our messages with him. While it was unfortunate we had
                    to resort to this, I felt we were justified in what we did, given the special
                    circumstances. In any event, I'm glad I never served under Meyer.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>Part of the staffing problem in China posts was scarcity. A generation of Chinese
                    experts had been decimated by McCarthy; it was not until the next generation
                    came along in the sixties that the Department had an adequate China corps. The
                    other part of the problem was that even though there may have been considerable
                    talent in the pool, the poison associated with China kept many good people away.
                    There were not many volunteers for China assignments. I decided to run the risks
                    of an assignment to Taipei. In fact, I relished the work, and as far as I could
                    tell, it never interfered with my career.</p>
                <p>Most controversy about Taiwan centered around assessment of the facts and the
                    almost verboten subject of diplomatic relations with the PRC. Assessment of the
                    facts was complicated by more than the divide between communists and
                    anti-communists. The Chinese population on Taiwan was not of one mind. In the
                    first place, there were two Chinese populations on the island. There was the
                    huge majority descended from immigrants who arrived two or three centuries
                    earlier. Known as Taiwanese or “native” people, they were bitterly resentful
                    about the way the Nationalist Chinese had treated them after the Japanese
                    surrender. There were good grounds for that feeling; the Nationalists had been
                    thoughtless, cruel and terribly corrupt. When these unsavory practices were
                    partially exposed by public protest, it caused a drastic crackdown in 1947
                    involving massacres of thousands of people. So there was a bitterness that you
                    could sense readily in native constituencies. These people wanted development of
                    Taiwan, not a hopeless and costly effort to recapture of the mainland.</p>
                <p>The second group of Chinese - about fifteen per cent of the population - were
                    recent arrivals after the collapse of the Nationalist regime on the mainland.
                    Among them were “good” guys and “bad” guys. The most senior “bad guy” was Chiang
                    Kai-shek himself, but there were many others. Even his son Chiang Ching-kuo, who
                    later became one of my heroes, was at that time associated with ugly activities,
                    including police brutality. Although this group was split between reformers,
                    conservatives, and reactionaries, the latter dominated, and naturally most of
                    the group tended to be mainland-oriented.</p>
                <p>The Embassy reported these facts, usually with some bias in favor of the
                    controlling regime. I don't think much fault could be found with our reporting
                    on how the Nationalists maintained their control or about the splits within the
                    Chinese community on Taiwan. The contest between groups came through pretty
                    clearly in our reporting. However, the embassy usually short changed the
                    concerns of the Taiwanese and gave excessive weight to the Nationalist point of
                    view. Spiritually, it was defensive of Chiang and his regime. That was a source
                    of friction for me at all times.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Both Chinese communities on Taiwan viewed us favorably. Both had high
                    expectations about US actions: the Taiwanese - and Nationalist reformers - hoped
                    that we would side with them and ease the repression. The ruling Nationalists
                    wanted us to let them go on as in the past; i.e., supporting their attacks
                    against China, minimizing complaints about their heavy handed rule, maximizing
                    our aid, and boycotting significant contact with prominent Taiwanese natives or
                    other opposition groups. During my first tour on Taiwan, the Nationalists were
                    still talking semi-seriously about returning to the mainland.</p>
                <p>I want to add a word about views in Taiwan toward the mainland. Those who were
                    hoping for a return to China proper were members of the Nationalist military and
                    civilian establishment who had fled with Chiang Kai-shek to Taiwan in 1949. The
                    older these people, the more they wanted to return. Over time, a new generation
                    began to participate in policy making and they were not nearly as interested in
                    return to the mainland as their fathers and mothers. I noticed the beginning of
                    this fundamental change during my first tour.</p>
                <p>The embassy under Rankin and to a lesser extent Drumright sided with the older
                    generation Nationalists, favoring intelligence and para-military cooperation
                    with them against the PRC. The embassy leadership and the Washington
                    establishment clung to hope that the Communist regime on the mainland would
                    collapse, somehow allowing the Nationalists to return home. People like Walter
                    Robertson, Rankin, and Drumright didn't know the new generation. They had a
                    skewed image of Taiwan.</p>
                <p>Although the Kuomintang and the Nationalist government continued to conduct a
                    number of small operations against the mainland, as time went on, there was less
                    and less support for this activity, especially among the younger generation of
                    mainlanders who tended to think a return to the mainland was a pipe dream. Some
                    of them shared the Taiwanese view that provocative activities by the
                    Nationalists might well back-fire with an armed response from the Communists. In
                    the 1950s, these young people did not yet constitute an alternative to the old
                    guard.</p>
                <p>Along with a few other young officers, I sympathized with this emerging group of
                    mainlanders. I believe we conveyed some sense of its importance to our
                    conservative superiors in Washington. While this group downplayed its
                    differences with its parents, its focus was firmly on Taiwan - and how to make
                    it a better place to live - rather than the mainland. Members typically believed
                    that if their stewardship of Taiwan was successful, then perhaps their chances
                    of returning to the mainland would be increased.</p>
                <p>As part of their approach, the younger leaders recognized the need to entice
                    elements of the Taiwanese population into collaboration, slowly bringing that
                    majority of the people into the government, army officer corps, Kuomintang, and
                    the policy making apparatus. In a muffled but radical break from his father's
                    failed policies, Chiang Ching-kuo became the leader of co-option. Of course,
                    even in this new group there was a nostalgia for China, but the new generation
                    were far more realistic about what could be achieved in the foreseeable
                    future.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>In a political sense, the vast majority of Taiwanese were disinterested in, or
                    actually opposed to, the idea of a military return to the mainland. Their
                    opposition seemed more a matter of self-preservation than ideology. They didn't
                    want to be destroyed by a Nationalist pursuit of a lost cause. They didn't want
                    to be the soldiers giving their lives for someone else's foolish dream.
                    Incidentally, by the late 1950s Taiwanese were a majority in the army. Virtually
                    all the soldiers on the off-shore islands were Taiwanese. So there was real
                    significance to this tension about a return to the mainland.In the 1950s the
                    idea of Taiwan “independence” from “China” was not yet a red hot topic, but it
                    was nurtured in certain parts of Taiwan, especially in the city of Tainan. Its
                    subsequent spread came as a reaction to the old Nationalist policies, to the
                    development of opposition politics, and to the long physical separation of the
                    island from the mainland. The most extreme proponent of independence in those
                    days was Peng Ming Min, who recently ran unsuccessfully in Taiwan's first
                    democratic presidential election. Peng's group emphasized the cultural and
                    historical differences between the Taiwanese and the mainland Chinese and urged
                    the establishment of a “Republic of Formosa.” These views were fairly popular in
                    Japan, especially in former colonial circles. Peng was allowed to enter the
                    United States where a substantial independence community also emerged. Taiwan
                    “independence” was an anathema to me, an arbitrary action sure to complicate
                    problems on both sides of the Taiwan Straits.</p>
                <p>In May 1957 we were stunned by an astonishing event in Taipei. The Chinese
                    authorities allowed, or did not prevent, a mob to attack and completely trash
                    the Embassy chancery. At a time of maximum conformation with the PRC, this was
                    hardly what we expected in the capital of our great anti-communist ally. The
                    precipitating event was an American soldier's killing of a Chinese whom he
                    claimed was a “Peeping Tom.” The victim, Liu Tze-jan, may have been peeping into
                    the bathroom window but he was also a Chinese intelligence operative, possibly
                    engaged in a black market operation. The American, a master sergeant named
                    Reynolds, was court-martialed. Charged only with one count of murder, he was
                    found not guilty by the American army tribunal. A civilian court might have
                    reached the same conclusion on murder but would have permitted conviction for a
                    lesser offense. All Chinese deeply resented this outcome, particularly when they
                    learned that the court had erupted into loud applause on hearing the “not
                    guilty” verdict and that our military had whisked the soldier out of Taiwan.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Following the court-martial, the embassy was subjected to well organized
                    demonstrations - obviously government approved, if not actually sponsored, since
                    some of the demonstrators were members of the government youth league. Normally,
                    no demonstrations took place in Taiwan; anyone who did so risked his or her
                    life. We were of course concerned and kept asking the authorities to clear the
                    streets. Instead, the demonstrations went on and on, with some participants
                    coming from an unruly neighborhood near the embassy populated with discontented
                    Nationalist ex-soldiers. Also nearby was a community of very poor Taiwanese -
                    slums. Rioting began over the lunch hour when the embassy was normally closed
                    leaving just a skeleton staff-marines, communicators, and a few others in the
                    building. The lunch hour was also the time the demonstrators put on the day's
                    special show of anger. On this occasion zealots tried to lower the American flag
                    and the ensuing struggle raised the crowd's fervor. People, led by a vanguard
                    that seemed experienced, then forced their way into the chancery, smashing
                    everything. In my office, for example, they smashed open the safe and totally
                    destroyed my desk, even unwinding the coils in my telephone. Far more serious,
                    they broke into the communications area breaking open all the classified
                    cabinets and ripping out all equipment, including encryption devices, dumping
                    everything all over the place. After several hours, they found and attacked the
                    eight or nine Americans hiding in the vault under the protection of our Chinese
                    staff. This included the marine guard who was disarmed by a courier, himself an
                    ex-marine who had the wits to prevent another killing.</p>
                <p>By late afternoon the embassy was demolished. As far as we could tell, nothing
                    was stolen, but we couldn't be sure about our documents and considered
                    everything compromised. Fortunately, none of our American or Chinese staff was
                    killed. There were several injuries - Meyer got brutally hit over the head with
                    a hammer and was never the same again. The marine guard and the courier who
                    disarmed him were badly beaten.</p>
                <p>While the riot was in progress, DCM Pilcher made several efforts to get in touch
                    with President Chiang Kai-shek. He couldn't be reached because he was “taking
                    his usual walk”; Chiang Ching-kuo, was similarly unavailable. The foreign
                    minister seemed to do his best to get in touch with the military, but nothing
                    ever happened until too late. Eventually, the military deployed hundreds of
                    military police, but never in sufficient numbers to stop the rioters. Late in
                    the day, the demonstrating crowd became increasingly Taiwanese as the riot
                    spread beyond the embassy, particularly to police stations where demonstrators
                    were being detained. By early evening, things were so out of control that the
                    government declared martial law and brought in two army divisions with tanks and
                    truck-mounted machine guns to stop the struggle. Perhaps more than a hundred
                    demonstrators - mostly Taiwanese - were killed. The episode was a humiliating
                    embarrassment to the government.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>Inexperience led to some lapses in my own behavior. I was not in the chancery
                    when the riot broke out. When I left for lunch, the atmosphere was tense, but
                    there was no sign of what would happen. Having lunched at my house with the
                    director of the language school in Taichung and dropped him off at the rail
                    station, I noticed a boisterous crowd as I approached the embassy. As a
                    precaution, I left my car outside and tried to walk in the gates, but I was
                    warned away. I tried every other access was known to me, going to the defense
                    attache's office - which had no idea what was going on - and then to the USIA
                    headquarters, where I picked up some intelligence about what was going on, and
                    stayed there until we evacuated just before the mob sacked that building.</p>
                <p>The ambassador was in Hong Kong leaving Pilcher in charge. My own mistake was not
                    to report to Pilcher who had set up a make-shift office in his house. I had
                    tried hard to call the senior officers without success, and I also assumed the
                    USIA people would have passed on word that I had been with them. After leaving
                    them I found my car and drove home, because I was very concerned about spreading
                    chaos affecting my family - my wife and recently born baby. So I became one of
                    the “missing” for a couple of hours until I was finally able to get through on
                    the phone to my boss that night. His comments taught me a lesson.</p>
                <p>I am not aware of any definitive US analysis of this extraordinary event. It was
                    very apparent to us in 1957 that the Nationalists in Taiwan were competing
                    fiercely for China's national mantle with a PRC that was vaunting its role as
                    China's new national sovereign. Without the prosperity that later mollified
                    them, it was also clear that the indigenous population in Taipei, especially the
                    poorer people, was disaffected from the ruling authorities. Nationalism and
                    discontent were surely the basic ingredients for the riots. In addition, there
                    were obvious misjudgements - on our side for letting the sergeant go unpunished
                    and on the government's side for allowing the demonstrations to go on when they
                    knew that tempers were running so high.</p>
                <p>I accompanied the ambassador when he formally protested the incident to Vice
                    President Chen Cheng who conveniently substituted for the elusive Chiang Kai
                    Shek. Chen, a former general widely admired for the way he cleaned up the
                    brutality and corruption in Taiwan in 1949, apologized and seemed genuinely
                    shocked by what had happened. But neither he nor other leaders provided us many
                    clues. My own speculation was that the Nationalist authorities, faced with both
                    strong competition from the PRC and their own angry countrymen in Taipei,
                    decided to give us a real scare by permitting demonstrations that they cockily
                    assumed they could control. When they finally realized things were getting out
                    of control, they repeatedly miscalculated the amount of counter force necessary,
                    perhaps because commanders were loathe to admit they had lost control.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>My explanation did not demonize the Nationalist regime. Coming from a person not
                    known to be enamored of President Chiang, I thought it would appeal to Rankin
                    and Pilcher. Instead, these gentlemen briefly lost their cool about the
                    Generalissimo, accusing him of authorizing a deliberate strike at the embassy by
                    intelligence forces trying to break into our secrets. I rather enjoyed defending
                    the president and his son whom I considered too smart to run such risks against
                    their foreign protector. After a few weeks Rankin and Pilcher resumed their
                    praise of Chiang as a leader of the Free World, and I was also back to my
                    normally critical stance.</p>
                <p>Washington was furious about the mob's actions in Taipei - as it should have
                    been. In Taiwan, the story was suppressed, but the regime was chastened. It
                    really bent over backwards to make amends, completely rebuilding the Chancery
                    using its own resources. Washington sent people to help us with the clean up.
                    One of our main tasks was to sort through the material strewn on the floors of
                    the chancery. We decided to burn most of it. Given my S/S experience, I was one
                    of the better trained persons to assess the importance of documents. My
                    impression was that we were not seriously compromised by the mob's actions -
                    although there really was no way to check that impression.</p>
                <p>While this was going on, we surveyed all Americans on the island to be sure they
                    were okay and found temporary office space in NAMRU (the Naval Auxiliary
                    Research Unit), an American medical organization. Our move was simplified by
                    having nothing much to take with us. Virtually no equipment escaped destruction.
                    For about six months we had to make do with borrowed furnishings and gradually
                    acquired replacement equipment such as typewriters and communications gear.
                    Although we had our marines, there was no way the temporary building could be
                    made secure; we had to begin from scratch with our files; although we had a few
                    miscellaneous safes that had not been broken into. My memory of our months in
                    those temporary quarters is a real blur.</p>
                <p>As I reflect back now on those days in the late 1950s, I would fault the embassy
                    and its mentors in Washington for complacency. We were overly optimistic about
                    Taiwan's alliance and attitude towards us. We did not fully appreciate the
                    agenda of Chiang Kai-shek and his cohorts in the control apparatus. In the
                    intelligence area and military assistance we tended to assume that there was a
                    higher degree of commonality of interests than in fact existed. Of course, we
                    had a shared interest in defending Taiwan from invasion. We also came to share a
                    common interest in the political stability of Taiwan and its economic
                    development.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Ultimately, our government was not prepared to give Chiang Kai-shek a carte
                    blanche, largely because we did not want to risk the dangerous kind of crisis
                    that broke out a year later over the Chinmen-Matsu offshore islands. Yet the
                    behavior of our officials, especially intelligence officers, kept the
                    Nationalists ever hopeful that in one way or another we could be brought to
                    support all of their activities. In sharp contrast to the situation during my
                    second Taiwan tour, our intelligence officials in the 1950s often lacked a
                    nuanced understanding of our policy or pushed it to its limits. They seemed too
                    ready to accept the analysis and information provided by the Nationalist
                    services - after all, they were originally in the same business with the same
                    lingo and aliases during the Korean War period. To make matters worse, by 1958
                    the CIA Station in Taiwan began dominate the embassy in dealings with the
                    Nationalists - both in reality and appearance. As a result I suspect we were
                    parties to a number of operations against the PRC that should have been squashed
                    by a strong ambassador. Many of these adventures took place in or through Hong
                    Kong, which complicated our relations with the British.</p>
                <p>As for the question of responsibility for the embassy's trashing, I think
                    Ambassador Rankin should have pushed harder and longer for a personal
                    explanation from President Chiang - less for what he might say than to register
                    our deep anger with his behavior as an ally. If we had been more forceful and
                    persistent with Chiang Kai-shek, we should have coupled it with some parallel
                    action against the sergeant, whose trigger happy finger started the whole mess.
                    On the later issue, I was in sympathy with the Chinese-it was justice gone
                    awry.</p>
                <p>In any event, I learned that it is healthy to have some suspicion of one's
                    allies, that evacuation and emergency procedures should be written and rehearsed
                    from time to time. The Taiwan experience was later useful to me in Korea. The
                    riot shook me thoroughly; it was a traumatic event in my Foreign Service
                    career.</p>
                <p>Let me now go to some other issues. We had a big assistance program in Taiwan,
                    especially military. Much of the earlier aid was in form of budget support,
                    which indirectly provided the resources for Taiwan to pay for imports, including
                    military equipment. By the time of my service I believe military assistance was
                    a mixture of grants and credits, administered by the Military Advisory Group
                    (MAAG) and supervised by the Embassy's Political Section. Economic assistance,
                    including agricultural, was administered by a large contingent of experts in AID
                    in coordination with the Embassy's Economic Section. By the latter half of the
                    1950s the focus was on project assistance: mostly import substitution, such as
                    fertilizer plants, power plants, and other infrastructure projects. Export
                    industries flourished considerably later when aid was drying up. We provided
                    advisors for a variety of industries, forestry management, sugar and rice
                    production, and rural development (through the JCRR). The “Green Revolution”
                    began in Taiwan.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>I concluded that agrarian reforms in Taiwan were highly successful; the program
                    was rather brilliant-one of the best then in existence. Some things were handled
                    better in Japan, but Taiwan was a very good show, much to the credit of JCRR and
                    the agricultural advisors we provided. The genetic work done for the “Green
                    Revolution” was pioneering of the highest standards.</p>
                <p>The most powerful hope I had when I left Taiwan was that the younger mainlander
                    generation - more realistic about returning to the mainland and less corrupt
                    than their elders - would coalesce with moderate Taiwanese, so that both groups
                    could work in blending the society together. No thoughts of recapturing the
                    mainland, no false hopes, but a focus on accomplishment in Taiwan. To
                    accommodate this, I favored a “Two Chinas” policy that would recognize two
                    Chinese regimes. I knew Chiang Kai- Shek was violently opposed, but I didn't
                    appreciate adequately the resistence such a policy would also encounter from the
                    PRC. I felt dual recognition was a worthwhile goal; faithful to our allies and
                    realistic about Communist China. At least it would have forced us to face up to
                    the issue of recognizing the PRC.</p>
                <p>I left Taiwan with “two Chinas” thoughts very much on my mind. I also felt a
                    distinct loyalty to the people on Taiwan. I felt we had an obligation to them;
                    they were victims of an accident of history - ruled by an emigre regime. But I
                    was firmly convinced any successful policy had to embrace the reality of the
                    PRC.</p>
                <p>My first tour in Taiwan left me rather sour about many aspects of Embassy Taipei,
                    which I thought it was a badly managed institution. I needn't repeat my
                    criticism of the Political Section under Meyer; Rankin was aloof and out of
                    touch. I felt strongly that an ambassador should know and mingle with his staff.
                    Rankin kept me waiting a month and a half before he deigned to let me pay a
                    courtesy call. That was just rude, particularly since it was not a large
                    organization. Drumright brought some measurable improvement as did Dave Osborn
                    when he replaced Meyer. Nevertheless, orthodoxy hung heavily over Embassy Taipei
                    throughout my first tour. Joe Yager, who became DCM after my departure, deserves
                    much credit for sheltering us and running an effective Economic Section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1958, you were transferred to the Political Section in
                        Tokyo.Was that an assignment you had sought?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLEYSTEEN: Yes, as I recall, I did seek the assignment, although it was one of
                    several possibilities offered by Personnel. I was attracted by the opportunity
                    to work in a political section, and I had an interest in Japan. The combination
                    seemed ideal for me.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>As a junior officer in the Political Section, my job was to report on Japan's
                    relations with China, Taiwan, Korea, and East Asia generally as well as to
                    assist the ambassador in a vigorous US effort to promote normalization of
                    relations between Japan and Korea. Like my assignment to Embassy Taipei, my
                    posting to Tokyo began with a jinx. Ambassador Douglas MacArthur complained
                    about the Department's sending him a Chinese language officer who didn't know
                    Japanese. Probably for lack of alternatives, the Department dug in its heels. I
                    survived pretty well for four years despite a very real handicap.</p>
                <p>Ironically, MacArthur, having complained about my language inadequacies, seemed
                    to enjoy interrupting my language study. I used to come to the Chancery one hour
                    early every day and worked hard on the language. MacArthur, an early riser,
                    would call me almost every morning - usually about fifteen minutes after my
                    lesson had started - and often give me an assignment to be done “immediately.”
                    These tasks could have been easily left for the regular working day, but he
                    persisted to the point that my language teacher just got tired of waiting
                    outside while I did whatever MacArthur wanted. It got so bad, I was eventually
                    forced to drop my lessons.</p>
                <p>My language deficit was a detriment to my work; I had to use translators and
                    interpreters. I leaned heavily on some my colleagues in the political and
                    economic sections, particularly Al Seligmann and Rick Straus, to help me; they
                    were very kind to do so. Fortunately, most of my contacts in the Foreign
                    Ministry spoke English, and I was able to use my Chinese extensively in my work
                    on China. For example, the head of the China Office in the Foreign Ministry,
                    Okada, did not speak English; we communicated in Chinese in which we both were
                    adequately fluent.</p>
                <p>Something over half my time was spent under Ambassador Douglas MacArthur, II with
                    Edwin O. Reischauer succeeding him in 1961. Bill Leonhart was DCM for most of my
                    time in Tokyo, although John Emerson took over in my final months. Among the
                    political counselors, the one I remember the best was Coburn Kidd-a German
                    specialist. He was a wonderful, fine officer, but he was a rookie to East Asia.
                    He was replaced by Jack Goodyear, another new comer to the Japanese scene, as
                    was MacArthur. Dave Osborn, the senior officer in the section, knew Japan well
                    as did several others. I don't know whether there was a conscious attempt made
                    to bring Europeanists to Japan; probably not. MacArthur was given his assignment
                    because Japan was the largest post in Asia and he was being rewarded for service
                    under Eisenhower at NATO. Having served much of his life in Europe, he was
                    attracted to officers with similar experiences, such as Leonhart who succeeded
                    Outerbridge Horsey, another Europeanist. In part this was the result of an
                    over-supply in the service of European experts; they still dominated the
                    personnel system and got first choices. The Japanese language officers got
                    second pickings. This European bias in embassy Tokyo had a minor negative impact
                    on staff morale. There was some resentment about key jobs going to people
                    unfamiliar with the territory, particularly when there were available well
                    qualified officers who knew Japan and Asia. Of course, these officers had to do
                    all the work anyway. They were the heart and soul of the embassy.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>In any event, the embassy seemed to function pretty effectively. With a major
                    exception of messages bearing on policy issues, which I will discuss later, the
                    embassy was proficient in its reporting. There was not much interference from
                    the top with normal political and economic reporting on domestic or foreign
                    affairs-so long as it was not on a hot topic or policy matter. There were
                    adequate numbers of Japanese language officers throughout the structure.</p>
                <p>I shared an office with Martin Herz and later Jim Sutterlin who dealt with
                    revision of the Security Treaty and Okinawa. Although we both reported to the
                    political counselor, we usually worked very directly with the ambassador and
                    DCM, who hovered over our shoulders because they knew Washington was
                    particularly interested in the subjects we covered. Thanks to understanding
                    political counselors, plus our own active effort to maintain solidarity with our
                    colleagues, this peculiar system worked tolerably well. My ready access to the
                    ambassador certainly saved me a lot of time and gave me more authority in
                    dealing with outsiders than was usual for a relatively junior second
                    secretary.</p>
                <p>I had an enviable position in the embassy - even under MacArthur and certainly
                    under Reischauer. I had ample status with my colleagues, and contacts in Japan
                    seemed relatively easy to make even as a non-Japanese speaker. At the Foreign
                    Ministry my contacts were normally at the office director level, quite senior in
                    the Japanese tradition. Not infrequently I would go up a level to the director
                    general of Asian Affairs or his deputy. That of course was exceptional in the
                    Japanese bureaucracy; Japanese officers at my level and age were astonished that
                    I had to gall to ask to see these high level officials, even more that I was
                    received by them. Some of the junior officers - all very high officials later -
                    resented me for this and occasionally told me so over drinks. My view was that
                    as a representative of the US government, I should try to contact the highest
                    level official who would see me. My success was probably a hangover from
                    occupation days. The practice is certainly over now.</p>
                <p>In general, the living conditions of the American staff were good. We didn't like
                    living in the embassy's huge housing compound, because it inhibited work as a
                    political officer; e.g. Socialist Party members would refuse to come to the
                    compound, and if they were to have tried visiting us, they might well have been
                    turned away by the police guarding the compound. After about nine months, we
                    finally got permission to rent a house - to which Japanese would come.</p>
                <p>Of my tasks, the hottest issue was Korea. Thirteen years after Japan's surrender,
                    Japan and Korea still had not established diplomatic relations. The Koreans had
                    a substantial Mission in Tokyo from occupation days; the Japanese had no
                    representation whatever in Korea and were pretty well barred from most activity
                    in Korea. The atmosphere between the former colonial ruler and the resentful
                    victim of its imperialism was tense. The main disputes were: fisheries;
                    treatment of Koreans in Japan; repatriation of Koreans from Japan to North
                    Korea; and reparations or “compensation” for the colonial period. Some of those
                    issues are still alive today.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>The repatriation of Koreans to North Korea was in many ways a more contentious
                    issue between Japan and ourselves than between Japan and Korea. Having been
                    brought as almost slave labor to Japan during WWII, Koreans who wished to return
                    to South Korea had been allowed to leave shortly after the end of the war; not
                    so for those from North Korea. When it became possible in 1959 for these people
                    to return to North Korea, the Japanese were prepared to assist the return. We
                    objected because a voluntary return of anybody to a communist police state was
                    virtually unthinkable for us in the midst of our ideological fervor. We dragged
                    our feet and tried to impose our wishes on Japan. The Japanese managed quite
                    skillfully to pacify us, using third party (International Red Cross) inspections
                    to insure that return was voluntary. Fairly large numbers returned to the
                    North.</p>
                <p>The Japanese and Koreans struggled or bickered over everything, often violently
                    in the case of fisheries. President Syngman Rhee frequently whipped up
                    anti-Japan nationalism to deflect domestic criticism of his heavy handed rule;
                    the Japanese in turn often infuriated the Koreans - and sometimes us - by their
                    patronizing attitude and behavior toward their former colonial subjects.
                    Steering around these rocks was a constant challenge, and despite enormous
                    effort on our part, we made little real progress until Rhee was overthrown in
                    1960 and Park Chung Hee came to power a year later with a clear understanding
                    that his great plans for Korea's economic development wouldn't work without a
                    reconciliation with Japan. Beginning in 1961, the two countries became really
                    serious about normalization. They welcomed our good offices, and quickly
                    established a practical, if still tense, working relationship. Normalization
                    occurred in 1965 while I was in Hong Kong.</p>
                <p>I discussed our efforts toward Japan-Korea normalization in an article I wrote
                    for the Japan Foundation's quarterly publication, Kokusai Koryu. Written from
                    memory, I dubbed it a “fragment of oral history.” I understand it will be
                    attached as Annex A.</p>
                <p>China and Taiwan were also lively issues for Japan in those days. The
                    Chinmen-Matsu off-shore islands had led to a major dispute in 1958 between the
                    two Chinas. The Japanese were very uneasy about our tough but defensive
                    position; in fact, the issue had caused a semi-crisis in US-Japan relations
                    before I arrived. In 1959 the Japanese were still nervous, though less so once
                    Khrushchev publicly disassociated the Soviet Union from Mao Zedong's militant
                    posture.In general the Japanese favored a softer line with the PRC. Within
                    Japan, there were several voices. The LDP reluctantly supported us; the
                    Socialists opposed us - the left wing Socialists particularly because they were
                    very close to the Communist Party. But within all parties there were cleavages -
                    moderates and extremists. Sorting out who was on which side was sometimes very
                    complicated, but I found it extremely interesting. I had to know which faction
                    favored what if I were to have a dialogue with them.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Despite much sympathy for Taiwan, Japanese generally felt China was more
                    important to them than Taiwan, and if it had been left to a majority vote, the
                    country would have switched recognition long before 1972. However, the
                    conservative, anti-communists who dominated US China policy also kept Japan in
                    line by firm advice and trade offs, beginning with Prime Minister Yoshida during
                    negotiation of the Japanese Peace Treaty, and still continuing while I was in
                    Tokyo. I spent a great deal of time talking to varieties of Japanese in contact
                    with China: officials, politicians, and journalists. From these contacts I tried
                    to convey an accurate assessment of Japanese opinion, and, of course, did my
                    duty in explaining our own policy - even though I was out of sympathy with some
                    aspects of it. My years in Tokyo were a wonderful introduction to the kind of
                    detailed analysis that I had to do when moved to Hong Kong in 1962.</p>
                <p>As in most of my posts I had relatively close relationships with CIA officers
                    dealing with my subjects. Don Gregg, one of my successors as ambassador to
                    Korea, was one of my counterparts in Tokyo and I got along very well with him. I
                    was generally aware what the Station was reporting and doing in my areas of
                    responsibility. My considerable contact with CIA people was very helpful to me -
                    and I hope to them.</p>
                <p>Revision of the US-Japan Security Treaty during 1958-60 was the defining issue
                    during my tour in Tokyo. I think we were caught off guard. In seeking
                    modification, we were genuinely motivated by a desire to ease Japanese concerns
                    and naturally assumed our move would be welcomed in Japan. We were of course
                    aware of strong opposition to the revision - and the whole Treaty for that
                    matter - from the Socialist and Communist parties. Since militant leftists had
                    not been able to prevent the original Treaty from being ratified and were not in
                    control of the Diet or the government, we didn't believe they would succeed in
                    blocking the Treaty's revision. What we underestimated was the existence within
                    the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) of a substantial dovish faction, which had
                    some sympathy for the left's views.</p>
                <p>Back during the Korean war, the US military used Japan as a rear base for
                    operations on the peninsula. Even after the end of our occupation of Japan, the
                    new security treaty gave us the right to use bases in Japan for the defense of
                    Japan and the Far East. The Japanese were concerned that some provisions of the
                    Treaty were inconsistent with Japan's rights as a sovereign nation; in
                    particular that US activities under the Treaty might automatically drag Japan
                    into war in the face of a strongly pacifist mood among its people.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>From the beginning, the treaty was severely criticized by leftists and others,
                    and that stimulated the conservatives, who supported the treaty, to push for
                    treaty changes that might dampen public criticism. I was in Washington at the
                    time-a young civil servant. I remember cables from the embassy in the mid-1950s
                    suggesting the Treaty should be revised. MacArthur, who was the counselor of the
                    department at the time, was responsive, and when he later became ambassador in
                    Tokyo he got Washington's agreement to revision. Americans in general thought
                    the Japanese would be receptive, underestimating opposition sentiment. The
                    process of revision opened up a great debate on Japan's role in the world based
                    on its history and future. I am convinced we missed the passion of this in our
                    initial reporting.</p>
                <p>When the revision process came to its final stages in 1959-60, the opposition
                    used bodily force and other blocking tactics, provoking the government into
                    foolish responses. After the opposition physically prevented the government's
                    efforts to have the Treaty ratified by its large majority in the Diet, the LDP
                    steam-rollered ratification through by stealth. There were other instances of
                    undemocratic behavior that dismayed the public and middle of the road forces,
                    adding tension to the national debate. My sense was that the debate was most
                    vigorous among young people, particularly intellectuals. There were more
                    disaffected people than we had assumed. In the midst of the storm, James
                    Haggerty, President Eisenhower's press secretary, arrived in Tokyo to prepare
                    the way for the president's long-scheduled visit. The students went on a rampage
                    at Haneda Airport, physically attacking Haggerty's car, threatening his party,
                    and forcing him to continue his journey to Tokyo by helicopter. This outburst of
                    student protest and violence culminated a couple of years later in extraordinary
                    extremism - extensive burning and closing of Tokyo University as well as the
                    formation of the “Red Army” and its terrorist tactics. In the chancery that
                    evening, the atmosphere was extremely tense, since we feared things might rip
                    out of control. With most of my seniors at the airport with Haggerty, I remember
                    summoning up all my unexalted authority to order the Naval Attache, a US Navy
                    captain, to pull back from the windows where he was running frantically back and
                    forth with a loaded automatic rifle. I was convinced his behavior would prove
                    incendiary if he were seen by the angry clouds outside.</p>
                <p>The protests continued after Haggerty's departure. With the public looking on
                    neutrally, huge numbers of students and left-wing union members occupied the
                    center city area near our chancery and the Diet building to stage noisy but
                    largely peaceful demonstrations. Several times a day I had to pass through a sea
                    of them on my way to and from work or going to the embassy annex a few blocks
                    away. With rare exception I found the students cheerful and rather friendly, the
                    labor unionists less so but not hostile. Eventually, however, the tactics of
                    both demonstrators and police became rougher, and violence broke out in the
                    vicinity of the Diet. As I recall at least two students, including a girl, were
                    killed; quite a few others were injured. The protest movement persisted until
                    the government finally capitulated and canceled the Eisenhower visit.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>I certainly fault the embassy for its management and reporting of this whole
                    affair. We left the impression that the LDP, which had been formed by the
                    amalgamation of the Liberal and Democratic parties, was strongly in favor of
                    treaty revision. This basic embassy view, effectively dictated by MacArthur and
                    Leonhart, understated the depth of the opposition to the revision, even in
                    conservative circles, and it discounted the degree of popular opposition. So
                    when opposition voices were finally heard loud and clear before the president's
                    scheduled visit, it was an enormous embarrassment to the US in general and the
                    American embassy in Tokyo in particular.</p>
                <p>Clearly, MacArthur and Leonhart, who were so confident about everything and so
                    eager to have a successful summit meeting in Tokyo, deserve most of the blame.
                    The political section - and CIA - at least tried to introduce a cautionary note
                    through comments from lower level Foreign Ministry officials, journalists, and
                    politicians who questioned prospects for treaty ratification. Some of this
                    material was reported but usually in a low key manner and framework of ultimate
                    confidence. As the unrest progressed after ratification and fissures appeared
                    within the LDP, many Japanese wondered why we could not see what was coming; it
                    was so obvious to them that the Japanese Government was having second thoughts
                    about the desirability of proceeding with the Eisenhower visit. At this point
                    some key officers of the Section took a stand, urging cancellation or delay.
                    John Stegmaier, a man with a real feel for the Japanese mood, was one of them.
                    For the most part these late signals and embassy second thoughts were not
                    reported or not reported accurately. To put it bluntly, MacArthur's and
                    Leonhart's censorship played a major role in the embassy's mishandling of the
                    visit.</p>
                <p>Of course, there was some collective responsibility for the embassy's
                    misjudgements. My colleagues covering Japan's domestic scene should have been
                    more alert to the extent of domestic opposition, particularly within the LDP.
                    Herz and I should also have had a better sense of it. We all should have tried
                    harder to warn Washington. All of us were too influenced by the steadily
                    optimistic line taken by MacArthur and Leonhart. However, these two men were
                    really responsible for the mess. The worse things became, the more compulsive
                    their confidence. Trapped by earlier misjudgments, they squelched pessimistic
                    reports and misleadingly jazzed up embassy assessments. Their role was
                    reprehensible - sometimes stunningly dishonest.</p>
                <p>By happenstance I was present as the note taker when Prime Minister Kishi sent
                    one of his cabinet members, a close confidant, to tell Ambassador MacArthur that
                    the government had reluctantly concluded President Eisenhower should not visit
                    Japan during his East Asian swing. Despite forewarning intelligence, MacArthur
                    appeared surprised and stunned, and for a while he tried to argue with the
                    messenger. More understandably, Washington also was stunned by the turn of
                    events, because even after weeks of turmoil in Japan, the embassy had persisted
                    with its flawed assessment.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>It would have been helpful if the US government had a better comprehension of the
                    ambivalence existing in Japan regarding the Treaty. We might have been more
                    active in trying to calm Japanese fears of being dragged into a conflict between
                    Cold War antagonists, explaining more clearly to them the advantages of a
                    US-Japan Security Treaty. We should have worked harder in general and
                    particularly with the LDP to prevent the Diet debacle. In fact, we may have
                    inadvertently fostered LDP parliamentary errors, because we pushed so hard for
                    prompt action on the revision vote. In any event, the US government failed to
                    understand the reality of the Japanese public mood, a mood which sustained the
                    demonstrations and the Diet maneuvers that eventually forced cancellationof
                    Eisenhower's visit.</p>
                <p>In the long run, revision of the Security Treaty was good for Japan; in the short
                    run, the process of revision and the need to cancel a US Presidential visit was
                    an enormous strain and humiliation. The Japanese were relieved when the trip was
                    canceled but at the same time ashamed. The humiliation was made worse by the
                    overwhelming reception Eisenhower received in Seoul.</p>
                <p>As a result of the confrontation, Prime Minister Kishi resigned and was replaced
                    by Ikeda. I was assigned as escort officer for the congressional delegation that
                    came for Ikeda's inauguration or equivalent ceremony. Ikeda received the
                    delegation at a garden party accompanied by his entire cabinet. He apologized
                    for all the confusion, promised to sustain good relations with us, and announced
                    the powerful economic development drive that later led to the coining of the
                    phrase “Japan, Inc.” When the head of the congressional delegation got up to
                    respond, he forgot his entire briefing. He didn't know Ikeda's name, didn't know
                    Ikeda was the prime minister, and couldn't figure out why “this nice Japanese
                    gentleman” was being so hospitable. I was so dumfounded I don't remember what I
                    did.</p>
                <p>My complaint about intellectual dishonesty in Embassy Tokyo is not a casual one.
                    During this period MacArthur and Leonhart bullied their staff into conveying a
                    picture of steadiness and progress which was contrary to reality. Finagling with
                    the truth was a problem throughout MacArthur's and Leonhart's tenure. I remember
                    one message which I wrote reporting a conversation with the director general of
                    the Foreign Ministry's Asian Bureau regarding Dutch behavior in Indonesia.
                    Leonhart, who seemed to favor the Dutch over the Indonesians, completely changed
                    the thrust of my telegram by casually revising my verbatim quotes. It was so bad
                    I told him I would not sign the telegram. If he insisted on sending it, he would
                    have to be shown as the drafting officer. Leonhart backed down after a couple of
                    hours of reflection, but we didn't talk for a couple of days.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>I had similar confrontations with MacArthur. There were times when he would
                    disguise his authorship of an idea by reporting it as a Japanese one, for
                    example putting his own words in the mouth of the foreign minister in meetings
                    that I attended as the note-taker. He would also fudge the facts in reporting
                    cables, suggesting in the commentary that the Japanese had originated an idea or
                    approved it when in fact there was no sympathy at all with the US view.
                    Effectively, we were conveying a distorted picture to Washington. When I
                    confronted MacArthur over this practice he laughed me off, but the practice
                    stopped at least in my messages.I especially remember my refusal to include
                    MacArthur's nasty invective about Marshall Green, our charge' in Seoul, in a
                    message to Washington. I won the battle. Even my softened version of the message
                    brought a rebuke from the State Department - asking both Tokyo and Seoul to mind
                    our manners. I don't think I solicited the Department's action, but it was
                    beautifully timed.</p>
                <p>Perhaps, I was caught up in this kind of conflict more than others because of my
                    personal standards but I suspect the main reason was my working so often
                    directly with the ambassador and DCM without the political counselor serving as
                    an intermediary. Fortunately for me, my stubbornness eventually led to a more
                    satisfactory relationship with the front office - far better than some my
                    colleagues who failed to draw a line in the sand.</p>
                <p>While on this subject, I might mention the effect on the embassy of the
                    ambassadorial change from MacArthur to Reischauer. It was tremendous. MacArthur
                    was viewed by the embassy as a little dictator. He was uniformly disliked. There
                    was considerable criticism about his lack of appreciation and understanding of
                    Japan; he rarely left Tokyo to visit other parts of Japan. Because of these
                    characteristics and the censorship that he and Leonhart exercised over a key
                    sector of embassy reporting, the atmosphere in the embassy was overbearing - in
                    some sense, I suspect it was very much like the atmosphere generated by his
                    uncle General MacArthur a decade earlier. The nephew was equally high handed and
                    equally full of himself.</p>
                <p>So when MacArthur left, there was a great sense of relief in the embassy. Bill
                    Leonhart served as charge'. He was just a little less unpopular than MacArthur.
                    He also had a huge ego. He was very competent and intellectually superior to
                    MacArthur. But he suffered from the same weakness: a compulsion to control all
                    things in the embassy - reports, personnel assignments, etc. Substantively, he
                    and MacArthur viewed Japan in the same way.As charge', Leonhart took some very
                    strange actions, so strange I thought he might be off his rocker. For example,
                    he issued orders about working on Saturdays, about duty officers on Sunday, and
                    finally a statement about wives' “obligations.” Today, those orders would be
                    attacked in court; in those days, they just seemed out of line or crazy. By pure
                    coincidence, an inspection had begun just as MacArthur was leaving, and Leonhart
                    got himself into terrible trouble with the inspectors. The orders that I just
                    mentioned were rescinded, and I believe that the unfavorable inspection report
                    effected both men's subsequent careers. MacArthur was offered the ambassadorship
                    to Belgium, rather than one of the large posts that he really sought.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Reischauer was popular. The political section had some initial reservations that
                    he might be naive. He had written an article for Foreign Affairs which mentioned
                    the “broken dialogue” between Japan and the US, suggesting that the Embassy
                    needed to broaden its outreach to include the opposition, especially the
                    Socialists. Obviously he was not well informed about our extensive contacts with
                    the Socialists. Despite some brief resentment over this, Reischauer was known to
                    us as a highly influential Japan scholar who knew the country well. Moreover,
                    after he arrived any concern about him seemed to evaporate relatively quickly.
                    He was very open to the staff and it responded to his civilized style. Not
                    everything was as I would have liked it, but in contrast to MacArthur,
                    Reischauer was a real blessing. More important, the Japanese responded well to
                    Reischauer, seeing his appointment as the end of an undeclared “post occupation
                    era” under the general's nephew. Reischauer had certain prejudices about Japan,
                    but they were honorable and the embassy staff could live with them without much
                    difficulty. His arrival gave the embassy a new lease on life. Control from the
                    front office was much more benign - far less domineering. I found that
                    Reischauer shared my views on China, and almost immediately, the embassy began
                    to take different line on the PRC's relations with Japan and its neighbors.
                    Whenever we could, we stressed the need for direct US-PRC communication. I was
                    delighted. His views on Korea were similar to MacArthur's but he was more
                    imaginative and considerate. In general the embassy loosened up. Reischauer
                    never tried to censor my reports. In fact, unless the report had something to do
                    directly with him, Reischauer didn't insist on prior approval; he would simply
                    read a copy of what was sent.</p>
                <p>So much for the nature of Embassy Tokyo and the problems we faced during my tour.
                    Let me ramble on a bit about the way Japan was looking at the world and itself
                    at that time. When I arrived in Japan in 1958, it was the end of the
                    post-occupation period. The Peace Treaty signed in 1951 formally ended the
                    occupation, but it still took another decade for us to stop trying to guide
                    Japan's domestic affairs. During this period, Japan's economy was beginning to
                    perform very well; GDP was increasing every year by large percentages. There
                    were unmistakable signs of the “new Japan.” Actually there were two co-existing
                    Japanese societies, new and old, and both very visible in Tokyo. Sony had a new
                    gleaming white transistor manufacturing plant that was the state of the art. The
                    Japanese military, given their close relationship with US forces, were was
                    pretty much up to date. The Japanese bureaucracy, particularly that part
                    involved in new initiatives such as industrial development and foreign
                    assistance, was modern minded. On the other hand, there was also the “old
                    Japan.” One could still see lots of small manufacturing plants that were quite
                    primitive. The taxis were dirty and worn; the drivers from the countryside
                    didn't know the city and drove recklessly. Getting one's car fixed properly was
                    difficult. The criteria that we use today to judge Japan's modernity were just
                    beginning to emerge. Back then Japan might have been categorized as a
                    “developing country in some respects.” Today everything is done with white
                    gloves on. That was not so in the 1950s.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>In the late 1950s, the relationship between Japan and Korea was still severely
                    constrained by Japan's colonial past. The Japanese forcible occupied Korea in
                    the early part of the 20th Century and their rule was harsh. Many Japanese were
                    not the least remorseful about their occupation; they didn't consider their rule
                    as particularly bad. They felt that they had done the Koreans a favor by
                    bringing in new technology and capital, thereby increasing Korea's economic
                    development. Although there was some truth to that, it was a rather arrogant
                    point of view to say the least. Fortunately, there was a more enlightened view
                    among more sensitive Japanese, including many in the Japanese Foreign Ministry.
                    The director general of Asian Affairs, Iiseki, and the office director for
                    Korea, Toshikazu Maeda, were with some justification considered “pro-Korean” by
                    their peers.</p>
                <p>As for the Koreans, there was a strong nationalistic bias - often stubborn and
                    excessively bitter - in their attitude toward Japan. They tended to use very
                    aggressive tactics; e.g. they would seize Japanese fishing vessels, beat up, and
                    imprison the crews for years. The smallest incident had to be dealt with at the
                    foreign minister level and sometimes at the prime minister/presidential level.
                    High level involvement in both Tokyo and Seoul pushed these disputes to senior
                    levels in Washington as well. In the case of a fishing vessel's capture, our
                    ambassador in Seoul almost always would be instructed to go see President
                    Syngman Rhee - who would more or less thumb his nose at us.</p>
                <p>I maintained close contact with our embassy in Seoul by cable and sometimes by
                    phone and sometimes by letter. I knew my counterparts as well as Marshall Green,
                    the DCM, and the ambassadors (Dowling, McConaughy, and Berger) whom I escorted
                    during their frequent trips to Seoul. On the other hand, there were tensions
                    between our two embassies. Both suffered from a “clientitis” that permeated to
                    all levels. We in Tokyo were overly pro-Japanese and our people in Seoul were
                    overly pro-Korean. In general, Washington was the referee and did a pretty good
                    job at it. Sometimes, tensions between our ambassadors got nasty.</p>
                <p>I dealt with many Koreans in Japan. I saw their top diplomat, Minister Yu Tae Ha,
                    who was later jailed for corruption. I had easy access to him and his staff,
                    which included Choi Kyu Ha, Park Chung Hee's successor as President of the ROK.
                    So I was quite familiar with the Korean positions on issues. Although I tried
                    hard to maintain neutrality, it was hard since I saw many more Japanese.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>We were bothered by the fact that many of the Korean residents in Japan were
                    pro-North Korean, tending to see it as an ideological failure on someone's part
                    rather than a fact of life. MacArthur, I think, suspected they were a nefarious
                    force directed to work with Japanese leftists against the US-Japan alliance, a
                    sub plot of the Cold War. However, the basic factor was that most of these
                    people had originally come from North Korea. In addition, some of the leftist
                    reaction from the Korean community was stimulated by unfair treatment by the
                    Japanese authorities. The oppressed and poor of the Korean community were ripe
                    for North Korea propaganda, and the North did a better job of appearing to
                    support them than the South did. In my reporting I tried to convey some sense of
                    this.</p>
                <p>This was my first opportunity to become acquainted with Korea. I didn't get to
                    visit the country until October 1961, but I had virtually complete access to
                    State and CIA telegram traffic on Korea, and I talked to everyone I could. Park
                    Chung Hee's coup in May 1961 intensified my interest; I followed the coup and
                    its aftermath with great care and fascination. It was a valuable lesson, which
                    stood me in good stead 18 years later when I as the American ambassador to Korea
                    had to deal with a military coup.</p>
                <p>In the early 1960s, Korea was still trying to recover from the war. There was not
                    much evidence of economic development. The hill sides were bare-no trees (very
                    much like parts of North Korea today.) It was quite depressing. One sensed that
                    it was the US Army and our aid program that held the country together - of
                    course our people peddled that line, demeaning the Koreans and things Korean. In
                    fact, Korea was in some respects a “basket case,” and its future looked rather
                    bleak. Yet even then there were some hints of what was to come. I saw a few
                    successful assistance projects. I was impressed by the high level of education
                    available to Koreans; I found the Koreans to whom I spoke very sensible. After
                    1961, I made several more trips to South Korea and observed Korea's economic
                    development program beginning to take off.</p>
                <p>Now let me get into greater detail about the Japan-PRC relationship. They did not
                    have diplomatic relations; Japan recognized Taiwan as the government of China,
                    just as we did. But behind this facade, considerable contact developed. PRC
                    officials came to Tokyo where they visited with foreign ministry officials,
                    politicians, and businessmen. Our rules precluded my seeing them. Generally, our
                    Japanese and foreign hosts took this prohibition into account whenever they
                    invited us to social functions. They accepted it as being a silly rule. There
                    were a number of LDP politicians who visited Beijing in addition to greater
                    numbers of Socialists, often shown making deferential approaches to Mao Zedong.
                    So a substantial relationship was developing. Trade was growing. The LDP was
                    trying hard to prevent the Socialists and Communists from monopolizing relations
                    with the PRC. That approach was not viable with our stubborn policy and got the
                    LDP and government into hot water with us on occasion.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>The United States tried vigorously to block Japanese contacts with the PRC,
                    sometimes in feckless ways. We sought to hinder the growth of trade as much as
                    we could; failing that, we tolerated trade in civilian areas, such as
                    agriculture, but correctly we stood firm in our objections to Japanese exports
                    of advanced technology and items that could be used for military purposes.</p>
                <p>Our negative posture did not change measurably during the four years I was in
                    Japan, but it was clear to me by 1962 that Japan-China relations would grow
                    closer as time passed - regardless of our policy stance. Furthermore, I felt
                    that the Japanese were right and we were wrong. From the beginning of my Foreign
                    Service career until Nixon's visit, I thought the US was wrong in its China
                    policy. This made my tasks sometimes very difficult.</p>
                <p>The Japanese had been forced to recognize Taiwan as part of the peace treaty
                    process. They maintained better than just “proper” relations with the
                    Nationalists in part because Chiang Kai-shek had forsworn a demand for
                    reparations. In addition, the Japanese had a nostalgia for Taiwan, their former
                    colony. Unlike Korea, the people of Taiwan had a view of Japan that was almost
                    positive. The occupation had been much more benevolent than Korea's, and some
                    compared Japanese behavior favorably to the early years of Nationalist rule.</p>
                <p>Although economic considerations helped drive Japan toward a closer relationship
                    with Beijing, the Japanese wanted to get along with the government on the
                    mainland for moral and strategic reasons as well. Following the disaster of the
                    war against China, the prevalent view by this time was that it would be smarter
                    for Japan to accommodate itself to the powerful ruling government in mainland
                    China. They hoped a closer relationship would advance Japan's security and trade
                    interests. The Japanese thought that we should be more understanding of their
                    position, and I thought they were absolutely right.</p>
                <p>There were also some sentimental factors at work, although these were often
                    exaggerated by Japanese under the influence of alcohol. Japanese felt indebted
                    to China for its influence on their culture, and quite a few of them were
                    genuinely remorseful about the barbarity of their past behavior. In those days
                    the Koreans didn't fare so well; the Japanese were much more deferential towards
                    China than Korea.</p>
                <p>When I was in Tokyo, the Japanese were much less concerned about China's military
                    strength than we were; there was some talk about Chinese power having a negative
                    effect on Japan, requiring perhaps some degree of remilitarization, but the
                    concern was buffered by the alliance with us. Japan-China relations are much
                    more complicated today than they were in the 1950s and 1960s.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>We also spent a lot of time on the Soviet Union. Washington in its directives to
                    us tended to assume a relatively monolithic communist world. Most of us in Tokyo
                    felt differently and when talking to Japanese, we tried to express our views in
                    more sophisticated ways than the black and white oratory stemming from
                    Washington. To their credit the Japanese had a rather accurate sense of complex
                    relations within the communist camp. They would stress that the Chinese
                    communists were quite different from those in the Soviet Union and that within
                    the Chinese Communist Party there were divisions about domestic and foreign
                    issues. The Japanese would provide me with the analysis of their intelligence
                    community, which I eagerly reported to Washington. -particularly since I agreed
                    with much of the Japanese analysis. My reporting was well received at least by
                    some factions in Washington. Since strains were becoming so apparent in
                    Soviet-Chinese relations, it is amazing to me that our ideologues managed to
                    hold off a realistic assessment for so long.</p>
                <p>I might at this stage talk a little about Japan's international orientation in
                    the late 1950s and early 1960s This is important because it affected Japanese
                    policy on Korea, China and the security treaty. When I arrived in Tokyo in 1958,
                    Japan was a country trying to sort out its past and its future; it was a society
                    in flux. The conservatives were in control - Yoshida was no longer the Prime
                    Minister, but still influential. Although a conservative, he did not
                    unqualifiedly defend Japan's actions during the war. He was proud of many
                    Japanese accomplishments, including its post-war effort to pull itself up from
                    the ashes. Yoshida was part of the establishment which tended to be
                    internationalist, anti-communist, pro-business, concerned by left wing radical
                    movements - beyond the Communist and Socialist Parties. All of these views were
                    welcomed by us.</p>
                <p>Although Prime Minister Kishi and some of the other conservatives with whom we
                    worked closely had been war criminals, they more or less shared Yoshida's
                    popular vision of a non-military Japan that would depend on the US for security
                    and concentrate its energies on economic development. Of course there were many
                    unreconstructed elements within conservative ranks. There were real hard liners
                    who would periodically vent their frustrations and complicate matters without
                    much real influence on policy making. There were also some conservatives who
                    appeared cooperative but had hidden agendas.</p>
                <p>The left was much larger than it is today. There was a large Communist Party, an
                    even larger and growing Socialist Party. Ambassador Reischauer and the political
                    section wondered if and when they would take the reins of government. Within the
                    Socialist Party, there was a faction with views close to the Communists. There
                    was another faction which sometimes sounded radical, but was in fact quite
                    moderate. There was an anti-Soviet nationalist faction within the Communist
                    Party. There were even pro-Soviet, pro-PRC, pro-North Korean figures within the
                    conservative camp! A rather complicated pattern. In general, most of Japan fell
                    into a category between the extremes. It was this middle group that was
                    sometimes hard for us to assess - as in the case of the aborted Eisenhower
                    visit.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>I don't think the embassy distinguished itself in mapping out the Japanese
                    political scene for Washington. I remember occasional presentations that were
                    excellent, but the ambassadors, especially MacArthur, had a proclivity to doctor
                    assessments to suit Washington's Cold War thinking. We could have had a better
                    understanding of the political process in Japan, and if we had, we might have
                    done some things better. We did not handle our relationship with forces of the
                    right in a very intelligent way; during the occupation we let the war criminals
                    off too easily; we tolerated the presence of the right wing in places where we
                    could and should have removed them. Many Japanese felt that we were letting our
                    concern with communism and the Cold War stand in the way of a proper
                    appreciation of Japanese sentiments. To some extent, I would say this was a fair
                    criticism.</p>
                <p>We also failed to appreciate the degree to which the Japanese left had earned
                    credibility in society because of its anti-regime, anti-war positions in the
                    1930s and 1940s. Although we took note of this in our reporting, we didn't give
                    it enough weight. When I first arrived, I went to a lecture by a semi-academic
                    politician - who had been recommended to me by some of my moderate Socialist
                    contacts on China. His lecture stunned me by its naivete about the Soviet Union
                    and PRC as well as the severe misunderstandings he had about US foreign policy.
                    He had a neutralist vision devoid of reality about the practical world; his
                    policy recommendations were disastrous. I wondered how reasonable Japanese could
                    support such crap, but in fact this man had considerable influence in university
                    and political circles. It stemmed from his cache as an opponent of Japan's
                    military governments. Baffling as they sometimes seemed to us, these attitudes
                    affected Japan's behavior - regarding revision of the security treaty, policy
                    toward China and so on.</p>
                <p>In the late 1950s and early 1960s, I was worried about the Japanese public's
                    apparent receptivity to left-leaning neutralist ideas. I was more bothered by
                    left-wing of the larger Socialist Party than by the Communist Party that had
                    already demonstrated some genuine nationalistic sensibilities vis a vis the
                    Soviet Union and China. Nevertheless, I didn't really fear that the left would
                    come to power in Japan; I thought that the LDP would find a way to block them or
                    that they would come to their senses before taking power.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>On the conservative side, I underestimated Japan's willingness to go along as a
                    sort of junior partner to the US - even though gradually moving along to a more
                    equal relationship. I predicted that by the end of the 20th Century, the
                    Japanese would become the “Gaullists of East Asia”; a more independent,
                    nationalistic, and possibly nuclear Japan - though no more hostile to us than
                    France. I did not cherish that prospect and urged that we try to forestall it by
                    establishing a web of carefully crafted relationships. I remember writing a
                    number of commentaries along these lines. Reischauer disagreed with me, and so
                    far he has proven right. In the complicated “sorting out” to determine Japan's
                    future policies, the direction and speed of Japan's economic development and
                    trade have played an enormous part, helping the conservatives and damaging the
                    left, which has proved unable to accommodate if not completely incompetent to
                    deal with these matters. Failures of the communist world have further limited
                    Japan's choices. The conclusion of this process has not come as a great surprise
                    to me, but I did not believe that the pattern would be quite as clear or as
                    helpful as it has been to our interests.</p>
                <p>Last, I might just make few remarks about the Japanese decision-making process.
                    When I was in Tokyo - and I think this is still very much the case -
                    bureaucrats, all the way down to lower levels, played a powerful role and were
                    exceptionally aware of the political context in which they operated. For
                    example, in making recommendations to the office director, the third ranking
                    officer in the Korean section of the Foreign Ministry would know our views,
                    probably from being the silent note-taker at a variety of our meetings with
                    Foreign Ministry officials. He would also be familiar with opinions of key Diet
                    members, often by having talked to politicians himself as a result of personal
                    relationships. My sense was that Japanese bureaucrats were more knowledgeable of
                    views in the Diet than we were about the Congress. This exposure helped young
                    officials shape decisions to be approved by their bosses. Incidentally the
                    number three on the Korea or China desk was often a marked man expected to rise
                    to deputy foreign minister or ambassador. Many of the senior officials I worked
                    with later started there.</p>
                <p>In addition, every level of the bureaucracy was more conservative than the one
                    below - which is not uncommon in any bureaucracy. Decisions made by consensus
                    moving upwards were hard to overturn; sometimes we did succeed but it was always
                    tough sledding. The process gave the Japanese bureaucracy an image of
                    independent power, but it was not quite as self-contained as people imagined. It
                    is interesting to note that much of the consensus building between the
                    government and the politicians was done at junior levels. That these officials
                    could advise their superiors about political sentiment struck me as quite a
                    contrast to the Department of State.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>In conclusion to these long winded comments I must say that my Japan assignment
                    was one of the best I ever had. It was fascinating. I witnessed some tumultuous
                    events which were part of Japan's effort as an independent, sovereign nation
                    trying to wean itself away from the dependent psychology associated with the
                    American occupation. Furthermore, I found the embassy's management under
                    MacArthur and Leonhart a negative learning experience I will never forget. I was
                    lucky that during the early part of my career I was in a political section that
                    gave me heavy exposure to the embassy's front office and the opportunity to work
                    with so many gifted officers. That was invaluable and served me well in my later
                    assignments.</p>
                <p>Q: In 1962, you were assigned to Hong Kong as an economic officer. How did you
                    manage to get such an assignment that made sense in career terms?</p>
                <p>GLEYSTEEN: During my whole career, I think I was rather lucky in being assigned
                    to positions that made sense for me and for the Foreign Service. I knew from my
                    friends that Hong Kong was about to have a major turn-over in staff. There was
                    talk of my replacing David Dean - a schoolmate and a language school fellow
                    graduate. I also knew the consul general, Marshall Green, and some of the right
                    people in the Department. So everything worked well from my point of view.</p>
                <p>In Hong Kong I was one of two deputies in the China Section headed by John
                    Holdridge. I supervised reporting on the PRC's economy; the much smaller Hong
                    Kong Section handled reporting on Hong Kong. In our section of “China watchers”
                    I recall only one officer who had special economic training. All I had was basic
                    economics at the undergraduate level plus my Taiwan experience. Although we were
                    amateurs in economic theory, our lack of expertise was not a major drawback. We
                    had a commonsense grasp of our subject which had a heavy political content. The
                    distinction between political and economic was blurred in our work.</p>
                <p>We had a local staff of about 15 people, who were highly competent. Some were
                    professional economists -university trained. We paid them well by Foreign
                    Service, not commercial, standards. Their services were an indispensable part of
                    our operations. We included the local staff in our discussions to a degree that
                    would not have been permitted in other posts. They did things that the American
                    staff could not do - e.g. reading far more voraciously and extensively in
                    Chinese than we were able to. What made this unique collaboration possible was
                    that in the main we used unclassified material open to all.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>I first met Marshall Green in Washington about ten years earlier while serving in
                    S/S - after his return from London to work in the EA Bureau. Then I had quite a
                    bit of contact with him while he was DCM in Seoul and I was in Tokyo. My early
                    impressions of Marshall were consistent with the image he had in the Department:
                    a lively, amusing, upwardly mobile, very ambitious officer. Looking from the
                    outside, I think Marshall did a good job as DCM in Seoul, except perhaps during
                    the first stage of Park Chung Hee's coup. In Hong Kong, I only had a very brief
                    exposure because he left soon after my arrival. During this brief period, I felt
                    Marshall was sound in his assessment of the China issues.</p>
                <p>Our paths crossed again in the late 1960s and early 1970s. He was the assistant
                    secretary for EA; I was the East Asia director in INR. I saw him daily, briefing
                    him on the latest developments in the area. I spent at least half an hour with
                    him and often more. I developed a great deal of respect for him. Throughout
                    every phase of his life, he was cheerful and a master of puns - even at
                    funerals.</p>
                <p>My second consul general was Ed Rice, a friendly hands-on officer. Ed was one of
                    the early “China hands.” He had a number of out-of-area assignments, but had
                    returned to EA to be a deputy assistant secretary before coming to Hong Kong. He
                    had known Chinese well, although by the time he reached Hong Kong, his language
                    skills had deteriorated.</p>
                <p>John Holdridge was in charge of what in Beijing would have been called the
                    political and economic sections. Heyward Isham, a Soviet expert, supervised the
                    political side and I the economic. There were 5 or 6 officers in each unit.
                    After about a year, Holdridge left for home leave and a period of duty on a
                    personnel panel-probably a promotion board-which about half a year. At Rice's
                    request, I filled in for Holdridge. It was somewhat awkward, because Isham and I
                    were the same rank, born in the same month, went to same university and
                    graduated in the same year - although we didn't know each other. I was chosen
                    over him simply because I was a China officer and he was not.</p>
                <p>When Holdridge returned, I went back to my economic assignment for a short period
                    before leaving Hong Kong. Substituting for Holdridge was very useful for me; Ed
                    Rice seemed satisfied and I worked with him on a major despatch, analyzing our
                    interests in China and recommending a shift in our recognition policy. Both of
                    us were proud of our hard work, which was the intellectual high point of my
                    assignment. My inquiries later in Washington suggest that Dean Rusk and Co.
                    hadn't seen it or brushed it aside.</p>
                <p>In addition to our China reporting, the consulate general had a normal operation
                    dealing with Hong Kong itself, including political, economic, and consular
                    functions. There was a little overlap between the two operations, but we got
                    along very well. Essentially the Hong Kong consulate general consisted of two
                    institutions, both supervised by the consul general. It was a large
                    operation.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>We lived in enviable circumstances. Hong Kong was the most comfortable of my
                    posts. The CG building was fairly new and well maintained. It was quite
                    spacious; every officer had a small private office. The building was located
                    downtown in a choice area near good restaurants. We had individual houses for
                    the most part, but also occupied small apartments in various lovely places. I
                    lived in a double apartment complex on Deepwater Bay, which was not too hard to
                    take. Other people lived in Stanley, Repulse Bay, and downtown. The DCM lived on
                    a hill side overlooking Deepwater Bay. The CG lived part way up the Peak. Living
                    may not have been luxurious, but it was far better than adequate. No one should
                    have complained.</p>
                <p>Hong Kong, in the 1962-65 period, was beginning to shine - a new development. I
                    remember visiting Hong Kong in 1953 when people were dismissing it as place that
                    “wouldn't make it” much past the end of the Korean War. It was having severe
                    economic problems caused by the enormous refugee influx; it couldn't pull itself
                    together. But we should not forget that in the early 1950s Korea was ridiculed
                    as a “basket case”, Taiwan was a dictatorship with severe problems, and even
                    Japan had not yet taken off economically. People tend to forget those rugged
                    days. Starting with the mid-1950s, Hong Kong began to blossom - becoming the
                    trade gateway into the PRC, providing a savvy base for foreign companies that
                    wished to work in East Asia and China, and serving as one of the first locations
                    for modern labor intensive export industries. Hong Kong lived under the rule of
                    law, with an independent judiciary based on English law. By the time I was later
                    stationed in Hong Kong, it was a thriving, vital city. The business community
                    was very vigorous. There was already considerable affluence in the Chinese
                    community, indicated by the ever increasing number of privately owned boats in
                    various harbors and new cars on the street. It was already clear that the
                    Chinese were becoming the predominant element.</p>
                <p>The American business community was heavily focused on banking. There were
                    considerable business opportunities for US banks in Hong Kong, but they were
                    also interested in being ready if and when China would open up for them. Many
                    major American companies located their Asian headquarters in Hong Kong. In the
                    same way as banks, these companies did business in Hong Kong, but they were also
                    readying themselves to invest in the PRC when the time was right.</p>
                <p>In many respects the rules for US contact with the mainland were silly. We were
                    all barred from doing any business with the PRC, leaving that growing field to
                    others. For example, we could not buy goods made in the PRC, even if sold in
                    Hong Kong. Food consumed in Hong Kong was more or less exempted. American firms,
                    such as banking, had to be careful that none of their transactions involved the
                    PRC or its citizens. That was not easy, but I think the American firms did their
                    best to keep within US rules. All American transactions were monitored by the
                    consulate general; we had a treasury attache with a staff that was strict on the
                    issue of trade with the PRC. I thought it was a very foolish policy. But it was
                    implemented with great vigor - except, of course, on senators and
                    congressmen.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>I might say a word about the problems and challenges of remote reporting on China
                    from Hong Kong. In those days virtually no Americans were allowed to go to the
                    PRC. No officials were permitted to do so, and the rare exceptions were doctors
                    or other professionals who had a good reason and political connections in
                    Washington. The Japanese and the Europeans, even if they did not have diplomatic
                    relations, freely allowed their citizens to visit and do business in the PRC.
                    Our rules were an enormous barrier to travel and a self-inflicted handicap to
                    our understanding of China. Nevertheless, once you overcame feeling foolish,
                    there were plenty of opportunities for useful work. We had to be vacuum
                    cleaners, pulling in any information about the PRC we could. We would talk to
                    every interesting traveler. We would meet endlessly in hotel rooms or invite
                    them to the consulate general or our homes. We would cover every minute of their
                    stay in the PRC. Our big net covered many Japanese, European, Australian, New
                    Zealand and some Americans - like journalists - who got in, one way another.</p>
                <p>With practice we became pretty good in the choice of interlocutors, so we were
                    able to focus on those who had something to say. Some were gold mines. They were
                    perceptive; they might had high level contacts up to the highest, including Mao.
                    They knew what to look for. Some of them traveled periodically to the PRC,
                    giving them and us, a sense of perspective. There were only a few of these, but
                    they were the gems.</p>
                <p>For the most part, people were willing to share information and views with us. We
                    had a good reputation, unlike the Cold War headquarters mentality and ideology
                    prevalent in Washington. The consulate general had built up an almost academic
                    reputation over the years; its staff was considered sensible and their judgments
                    had proven pretty good. Many consuls general contributed to this aura. In my
                    time, I felt lucky to inherit it and worked hard to sustain it. Our sources were
                    usually cooperative; quite a few liked coming in to the consulate general,
                    although we always offered to meet them elsewhere. As far as I know, none of our
                    contacts were barred from travel to the PRC because of us, although it was
                    always a concern. We tried to protect people whose comments could be easily
                    traced back to them - a remark by Mao Zedong could be easily traced back because
                    only a few would have had the opportunity to hear it. Generally, however, our
                    activities were very transparent.</p>
                <p>The second aspect of the job was to be an intelligent reader, mostly in
                    translation but selectively in Chinese as well. We were allowed legally to buy
                    Chinese communist publications - a great privilege! We read for hours on end. We
                    had a very, very large translating operation that was only closed recently.
                    Every day, there would be reams and reams of material coming out of that section
                    and by wireless from a parallel operation in Okinawa. Much of the stuff was
                    quite good and useful. I did my own reading whenever I could, thereby
                    maintaining some fluency in the language in which I was trained. This was the
                    only time in my career that I did that - reading original political and economic
                    materials coming from the PRC. I concentrated on certain key publications; I
                    wasn't good enough to skim huge volumes of material.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>We drew from academic sources everywhere in the world for help with our analysis.
                    If it was not in English, we would have it translated. We had intelligence
                    operations paralleling our work; the intelligence community was less fettered by
                    restrictions than we were, and I found their product useful. It was not the
                    answer to a prayer, but it did add to our knowledge. The information collected
                    was freely shared with us; I had good relations with the station chief.</p>
                <p>We exchanged information with other countries, primarily Western European ones
                    and Japan. We worked closely with the British whose operations were quite
                    similar to ours, although they had the advantage of having intelligence
                    representation in the PRC. In terms of quality, I generally found the Japanese
                    most insightful - perhaps a subjective hangover from my previous assignment. I
                    maintained contact with the Japanese consul generals and their deputies. If I
                    had to rank various countries in terms of their usefulness for us I would
                    mention Great Britain first, followed by Japan, and then Western European
                    countries. They were all very cooperative and very useful.We generally did not
                    interview refugees directly, because the British had a skilled refugee screening
                    program that produced large quantities of material. Information collected from
                    refugees included a great deal of junk and often lacked perspective. Refugees
                    were not necessarily representative of the mainland Chinese population or
                    balanced observers of the China scene. Many academics-e.g. Ezra Vogel, Doak
                    Barnett, Jerry Cohen-interviewed refugees at length. I was happy to glean their
                    results rather than go through the drudgery of their interviews. Occasionally, I
                    myself talked to a particularly interesting refugee.</p>
                <p>Perhaps colored by my own interests, my sense of priorities in Hong Kong was:
                    first, interpreting events within China; second, trying to influence our China
                    policy by conveying the Asian pieces of the context; third, providing insight on
                    the Chinese approach to the Soviet Union, Indochina, Taiwan, Hong Kong itself,
                    and East Asia generally.</p>
                <p>Although I know of no institution that did it better, I must admit we did only a
                    passable job of interpreting what was happening within China. Despite the
                    lurches of Mao Zedong's leadership and the mind-boggling nature of some of his
                    policies, we usually were able - with a time lapse - to use refugees and
                    traveler reports, publications, and occasional snippets of good intelligence to
                    give Washington a fair sense of what was actually happening in the country. But
                    there were always big gaps; and we had few clues to help decipher what was going
                    within the inner councils of the leadership. Our self-imposed absence from China
                    and ban on contacts with Chinese didn't help. Our biggest failures were in the
                    area of prediction. There were titanic shifts and events, such as the “Great
                    Leap Forward and “Cultural Revolution,” that we did not anticipate. Yet no one
                    really did; it would have been a miracle if we had.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>When I arrived in Hong Kong, the PRC was suffering from the collapse of the
                    “Great Leap Forward.” That zany policy, begun in 1958, was an act of hubris on
                    Mao's part that rapidly backfired into a major disaster for China. The intensity
                    of forced agricultural production, the formation of massive communes, and the
                    resort to crazy shortcuts - such as the melting down of every bit of cast iron
                    to make useless backyard steel, deep plowing that quickly ruined the soil, etc -
                    took a very heavy toll and throughly discredited the regime. Analysts say that
                    as many as 20 million people may have starved to death. At least several
                    millions died from man-made and natural disaster. I don't think anyone really
                    knows, but it was really a cruel period for the Chinese people. North Korean
                    policies some times remind me of Mao's.</p>
                <p>A surprising number of people in the West were slow to recognize the insanity of
                    the “Great Leap.” During the initial fanfare a number of romantics, journalists,
                    and even some in our intelligence community speculated that some elements of the
                    “Great Leap Forward” might actually work; I thought they were nuts. After the
                    collapse, a different crew of Westerners, following Taiwan's lead, postulated
                    the possible demise the of the PRC. This was less ridiculous but still
                    dangerously misleading. I believe the consulate general's solid reporting
                    contributed significantly to the commonsense views reflected within the
                    government and much of the media.</p>
                <p>Similarly I think we did a pretty good job in picking up bits and pieces of
                    information in the aftermath of the “Great Leap,” including various reforms with
                    which the PRC was experimenting. Of course, we had far more difficulty trying to
                    figure out what was going at the top. There appeared to be a serious struggle
                    for leadership of the party and the government. Along with several others, I was
                    quite sensitive to this most important issue; our best source for analysis was
                    Chinese publications. I wish I had done my research more boldly because the
                    “Great Leap Forward” was the precursor to the “Cultural Revolution” -another
                    program devised by Mao over opposition from more pragmatic leaders. The first
                    signs of the new upheaval appeared just as I was leaving Hong Kong. They looked
                    peculiar to us and we reported them, never being able to relate one odd
                    development to another with enough coherence, thereby failing to see the shape
                    of the horrendous “Cultural Revolution.” I kick myself for having failed to do
                    that. Analyzing what was going on in Beijing's Forbidden City was very difficult
                    for everybody in the outside world - and for most Chinese. But over the years, I
                    think the consulate general deserves good marks for its analysis of the general
                    situation in China.</p>
                <p>Our track record on foreign policy matters was okay - probably a cut better than
                    okay. We had a sound appreciation of Sino-Soviet relations - considerably more
                    accurate than some in Washington. We had a fair understanding of the PRC's
                    approach to Indochina as well as its military capacities.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Most important to me and in contrast to Embassy Taipei, the consulate general was
                    open minded and relaxed in its approach to US policy toward China. Consul
                    General Holmes, a distinguished newcomer to Asia who preceded Marshall Green,
                    broke the taboos in talking about our policy toward the PRC, and from then on
                    the consulate general openly pushed for a more pragmatic policy. Marshall Green
                    did so in a variety of ways, and, as I have already mentioned, Ed Rice and I
                    sent Washington a message similar to Holmes's, less elegant perhaps but written
                    with considerable wisdom about Asia. Those messages would look pedestrian today;
                    at the time they were quite bold.</p>
                <p>I came into the Department in 1951, during the Korean war. I was deeply troubled
                    by communist aggression on the peninsula and wrestled with what we might do. I
                    was not happy about the course of events, but it seemed inevitable to me that in
                    due time, we would have to establish relations with the PRC - in some form
                    immediately to be followed by “normal” in due time. We were out of step with the
                    vast majority of other countries. From the beginning of my foreign service
                    career, I was uncomfortable with our PRC policy. It was a cloud over me at my
                    early posts. Dutifully, I carried out US policy as best I could, but I was quite
                    out of sympathy until 1971. This didn't mean I “liked” the PRC regime or that I
                    condoned its crude pressure on the Nationalist off-shoreislands or Taiwan. But
                    since the PRC seemed well ensconced, I felt it was short-sighted not have some
                    kind of relationship with it.When I was interrogated in early 1955 by Scott
                    McLeod's investigators about my alleged sympathy toward the Chinese Communists
                    (see remarks regarding my experience in S/S), I made the following comment:
                    ...Concerning my own views on Communist China, I stated that communism and
                    communism in China were an anathema and disappointment to me. Since the Chinese
                    Nationalist Government was the one I grew up with and because of my family
                    views, it was naturally the one I “supported.” From 1945 to 1949 I was mad and
                    sad about its ineffectiveness. After 1949-50 I began to think we probably would
                    have to recognize Communist China diplomatically, as unpleasant and hostile as
                    it was and would be. The Korean War removed this consideration. I went to on to
                    explain that at present it would be disastrous to recognize Communist China
                    because of the tension surrounding Quemoy, Matsu, and Formosa, but I said I
                    thought we should think through the problem for a future date...</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>These remarks are quoted from an angry memorandum I wrote to myself on February
                    3, 1955 to record of a most unpleasant experience. During the next 8 years in
                    Taiwan and Japan I became thoroughly convinced the time had arrived to change an
                    outmoded policy. I saw normalization with the PRC as a process that would
                    develop over years, reflecting the new reality in East Asia, devoid of any
                    adverse moral connotation, and following the practice of most of the world. The
                    choice was simply this: should we have a perpetual wall between two important
                    countries or did we have to deal with the reality of a communist regime in
                    China. If the latter, then wouldn't it better to have official relations with
                    it? Our existing policy closed its eyes to the facts on the ground. In addition,
                    I thought that we were paying a penalty in having much of our dialogue with the
                    PRC often conducted through third parties - the process of using an intermediary
                    lost us opportunities and made for miscommunications because some of the third
                    parties had their own agendas. I thought about and talked a lot about the
                    consequences for the balance of power. In those days I did not foresee China
                    shifting quickly from its hostility toward us, and I doubted a policy change
                    would have a major beneficial effect on our dealings with the USSR. Yet I
                    thought it would be a move in the in the right direction, and I was sure it
                    would ease our relations with allies such as Japan.</p>
                <p>It took Richard Nixon and Henry Kissinger to put all the pieces in play - for
                    their own reasons and in a strategic framework that exaggerated the benefits.
                    When the breakthrough came with Kissinger's trip to Beijing in 1971, our
                    obsession with “the menace of China” was replaced by an overly simple view of
                    the PRC as part of a united anti-Soviet front. Like others, I understood the new
                    policy in terms of our Cold War interests; I was happy that the US was finally
                    going to normalize relations with the PRC. At the same time, I sensed that the
                    anti-Soviet rationale for the opening to the PRC might be interpreted
                    excessively and lead us to mishandle our relations with Beijing. It is a
                    complicated subject, but I believe that I was right in these concerns, which
                    came to the fore in both the Ford and Carter administrations; I participated in
                    some of the discussions that I will get to later.</p>
                <p>The change in US policy toward China should have made long before 1971-72, and we
                    would have been better off if it had been done openly rather than in secret.
                    Despite being pushed to the sidelines while Kissinger and Nixon did it, I am
                    really grateful to them for their bold action. As for Consulate General Hong
                    Kong during the 1960s, I would say we contributed significantly to preparations
                    for the change - both through our analysis of the China context and our policy
                    recommendations. A lot of energy went into the effort.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>Friction in Sino-Soviet relations, which burst into public debate while I was in
                    Hong Kong, fascinated everybody, even those in Washington who could hardly
                    believe what was happening. It is hard to remember now the role of the Americans
                    who fought so hard to interpret the Sino-Soviet “bloc” as two communist regimes
                    both marching in the same direction mostly under Soviet leadership. From every
                    scrap of information that we collected, it looked like these people were way
                    off-base. CG Hong Kong deserves kudos for its quite objective picture of reality
                    - portraying the tremendous strains between the PRC and the Soviet Union, which
                    were heading toward a climax of some sort, with actual fighting to take place
                    along their borders in 1969. In addition to the public diatribe conducted in the
                    names of Khrushchev and Mao, there was all sorts of intelligence about troubles
                    dating back to 1954 and earlier. For all its conviction about a Sino-Soviet
                    monolith, I must say in fairness, that we were never instructed by Washington to
                    hew any party line - unlike the editorial work by MacArthur in Embassy Tokyo or
                    the censorship exercised in Embassy Taipei.</p>
                <p>My own views on Sino-Soviet relations were importantly influenced during graduate
                    school at Yale. When I was an undergraduate, I had an orthodox Cold War view of
                    the problem. I assumed that Stalin and his cohorts played a major role in
                    setting Asia's fires - which in fact they did. And I assumed China was
                    cooperatively involved, as a kind of junior partner. But in graduate school I
                    had a chance to do considerable reading on the earlier communist period that
                    highlighted the independence of the Chinese communist movement. I became
                    convinced, as some scholars had, that independence, rivalry, and friction were
                    the reality between the two nations. Essentially, I thought that each would go
                    in its own way, following its national interest more than ideology. That meant
                    that on some issues, there would be a partnership, but often the two would find
                    themselves on the opposite sides. By the time I reached Hong Kong, my views were
                    pretty close to what historically seems to have been the pattern.</p>
                <p>After a checkered record of support in the early years, the Soviets finally
                    assisted Mao come to power in the late 1940s. But rarely did the Soviets do all
                    they could have done. In the post-war period, the Soviets pillaged Manchuria for
                    its industrial equipment and later demanded certain territorial concessions from
                    the Chinese - including some of the same things the Russian Empire demanded of
                    Imperial China in 19th Century. I was impressed by the replay of this clash of
                    nationalisms. When the more obvious signs of strain began to appear - in the
                    mid-1950s, and even more pronouncedly in the late-1950s with Khrushchev's public
                    refusal to back Mao in the Taiwan Straits - I thought we faced two major powers
                    that would go their own ways, guided, as I said, mostly by their national
                    interests. Despite my analysis, I was still amazed in the late 1960s when they
                    carried this behavior close to the point of a major war and sought to enlist our
                    weight into the contest.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>While I was in Hong Kong the consulate general also spent much time speculating
                    how the Chinese would deal with various events in Vietnam and the Taiwan
                    Straits. The Taiwan off-shore islands had again became a subject of US-PRC
                    tension. The PRC was in bad shape economically. The People's Liberation Army
                    (PLA) was suffering as a consequence of the “Great Leap Forward” and its
                    aftermath; so it was hitting bottom as a consequential military force. At the
                    same time, Vietnam was becoming an increasing problem for the PRC because of our
                    military build up. The PRC sent substantial assistance to the North Vietnamese,
                    a very complicated process. Given these conditions, there was discussion in
                    Taiwan of taking advantage of the PRC's preoccupations and weaknesses through a
                    variety of provocative actions. The U.S., as I remember it, made a statement,
                    probably in the Warsaw or Prague Talks in 1963 or 1964, that we would not
                    support any Taiwan action raising the level of tensions. That was well received
                    by the PRC. These and other events gave us in Hong Kong an opportunity to assess
                    the PRC's mind set and possible moves, which we did very conscientiously.</p>
                <p>One of our most consuming and tricky challenges was to assess likely Chinese
                    behavior in Vietnam. Washington was obviously concerned about what the PRC might
                    do militarily if we intervened more directly in Vietnam. Stimulated by my Geneva
                    Conference days, I tried to keep up with Indochina even though it was not part
                    of my normal portfolio. While in Tokyo I had managed a rather long visit to
                    Vietnam. I went twice while in Hong Kong and several times more after returning
                    to Washington. I traveled to many regions of the country as well as Saigon,
                    talked to all levels of the military, met at length with our embassy staff,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>In general, the consulate general, specifically including Rice and me, felt that
                    the PRC was being very cautious and demonstrating little evidence of intention
                    to intervene militarily. This was a crucial judgment on our part, because
                    Washington was trying to assess how much risk we were running as we escalated
                    our military presence in Vietnam from an advisory role to combat with US forces.
                    Of course, we put in caveats - one being the obvious need to be prepared if our
                    judgment proved wrong. Although I was fairly confident of our prediction, it
                    bothered me personally. Effectively, we were assisting those in our government
                    who favored deeper involvement in Vietnam. With a brief lapse in 1965, I was
                    opposed to such entanglement.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, our assessment of the PRC-Vietnam relationship got me into a
                    running argument with those in INR and the intelligence community who worried
                    about Chinese intervention as in the Korean War. Alan Whiting, who was INR's
                    director for East Asia, disagreed strongly with us. He had written a famous book
                    on the PRC's intervention in the Korean war; he tried to apply the same lessons
                    to the Vietnam situation and came to an entirely different conclusion than I and
                    most of my colleagues. Our debate conducted by cable got into the press from
                    sources “who did not wish to be identified.” I deduced and later confirmed that
                    Whiting was briefing reliable journalists “on background.” I did the same,
                    giving the New York Times some good stories. In retrospect, I think we were both
                    a bit foolish.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>As for your question about our access to information and the degree of our
                    influence in Washington, I would say that the consulate general was well served
                    with information, while the effect of our recommendations was less than desired.
                    Our analyses of the general situation in the PRC got broad circulation and were
                    widely respected but they didn't reach the highest levels of the Department;
                    they were fodder for the analysts in EA, INR and other parts of the intelligence
                    community. We had some disputes with Washington over the national intelligence
                    estimates which did not always match ours. CIA would tell us that we were wrong
                    and they were right, if only because they had many more resources to devote to
                    the PRC - and anyway, headquarters is always right! These disagreements were not
                    a big problem for us; they were arguments among peers and we really didn't give
                    that much of a damn about what the bureaucracy in Washington believed.</p>
                <p>On issues affecting bilateral relations - on which we wrote some wonderful
                    reports - the consul general often helped in their drafting and signed them out
                    in his name. That plus restrictive circulation helped get attention - at least
                    at the assistant secretary level. I don't know how they were viewed at higher
                    levels; at least there was no attempt to stop us from our analysis or to tell us
                    to hew the line.</p>
                <p>On issues such as possible military engagement between the PRC and Taiwan or
                    China and Vietnam, our reports were thoroughly read in Washington. We would get
                    specific questions, some of which indicated certain biases, which was alright
                    because we were not hemmed in our responses. In the case of US-Vietnam
                    relations, I believe our important messages reached high levels in the
                    government.</p>
                <p>I also remember being impressed by how much traffic we received on Vietnam,
                    including intelligence material. We were near Vietnam, but we had a detachment
                    that our people in Saigon did not. So we some times submitted interesting
                    comments, even though our immediate responsibility was the PRC. For example,
                    after the Tonkin Gulf incident, Ed Rice inspired and supervised some careful
                    analysis by our section plus the military attaches and CIA Station. As I recall
                    them, our comments would look good today in light of what we have since learned
                    about the incident. We were never convinced that there were in fact military
                    clashes in the Gulf; we suspected that the US was seizing on isolated indicators
                    to escalate our military intervention. We relied heavily on intercepts of
                    Vietnamese communications, technical intelligence gathering, and Beijing's
                    attitude. This intelligence was rapidly available to us in Hong Kong because we
                    were part of the collection system.</p>
                <p>I admired Rice for team efforts such as this one. In other instances he also
                    signed off on messages, even the more strident ones and those he knew would draw
                    opposition. I don't want to leave the impression that we were heroes in Hong
                    Kong. Most often we were only one voice in the cacophony of noises emanating
                    from groups of China watchers.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>Let me address the question of how much influence the United States had on China
                    during this time. In the 1962-65 period, our influence was significant. On the
                    fundamental aspects of our policy - the embargo and containment of the PRC -
                    although we could not control other countries, we severely complicated the PRC's
                    efforts to broaden its relationship with the outside world. All of our military
                    and economic goods, all of our technology as well as most of the developed
                    world's military and technical exports, were deflected away from the PRC, thus
                    impeding its economic and military development. As the leader of the “Free
                    World,” we did exercise a negative influence on the PRC, even if it meant an
                    increasing tension with some of our allies who did not see the PRC as the enemy,
                    as we did. Some aspects of this policy of denial - for example, the complete
                    trade embargo - were inconsistent with my views on recognition of the PRC.</p>
                <p>In the international sphere, our policy of not recognizing the PRC-keeping it out
                    of the UN, handicapping it in all fora - was a joke - on us. We were kidding
                    ourselves if we thought we could keep the PRC isolated for any length of time.
                    Our policy was the dominant one in the developed world, but most countries found
                    easy ways around it - as did many Americans. It was a doomed policy - just
                    encouraging people to cheat. When the policy change finally came in 1971,
                    everyone was ready for it.</p>
                <p>As for the PRC's domestic policies, we had no visible impact. We probably
                    provided the hard liners in the PRC with a justification for their policy. We
                    may have had a negative impact on PRC domestic policies, helping hard liners
                    take their crude approach to domestic issues as part of an anti-US campaign.</p>
                <p>Three times - the Korean war, the off-shore islands crises, and Vietnam - we
                    engaged in or threatened combat against the PRC. That certainly influenced
                    Chinese views of the world around it. Although our ignorance helped to bring the
                    Chinese into the Korean war, I have always felt - and still do today in light of
                    historical documents now available - that we were right to assist South Korea
                    defend itself in 1950. Over the longer term, our actions in Korea had a definite
                    impact on PRC policies, influencing Chinese behavior on the off-shore island
                    crises and in Vietnam. Our firm stance in Korea gave us some credibility in
                    Beijing. In short our influence on the PRC was certainly heightened by our
                    forceful military posture in East Asia; it compelled PRC policy makers to take
                    our military presence into account.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>I should make a summary statement on my tour in Hong Kong. Of all of the posts in
                    which I served, except perhaps Korea which had some unique problems, I found
                    that the intellectual quality of the consulate general work was outstanding. The
                    consuls general insisted that the staff maintain an objective view and that
                    contributed to enlightened reporting. My colleagues knew their stuff. Reporting
                    from Hong Kong was very special; I don't think I saw that same level of insight
                    again. The staff had a sense of participation on substantive issues that was
                    great for everybody. The staff in Hong Kong was carefully chosen. It was a good
                    team and worked well together. The intelligence community in Hong Kong was well
                    integrated with the rest of the American staff. It was a good show. Even the
                    military attaches, of which there were many, were part of the team, although
                    they sometimes could be difficult with their own agenda. They had too much money
                    and quite often ran clumsy covert operations without experience, thereby getting
                    the U.S. government in trouble.</p>
                <p>When I arrived in Hong Kong, Oscar Armstrong was the deputy consul general. He
                    was followed by John Lacey. Both of them played a very useful role. They were
                    excellent officers. As I mentioned earlier, Hong Kong had two separate entities:
                    the “China watchers” - an embassy in exile - and those responsible for normal CG
                    duties with the territory of Hong Kong. In that second category, we had a very
                    active commercial operation. Then we had a large, sprawling intelligence
                    community, which presented technical and legal challenges. The deputy CG was the
                    keystone of keeping all in sync. I had a high regard for the officers under whom
                    I served and for those whom I supervised.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1965, you went to Harvard for Advanced academic
                        studies, Wathat your desire?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLEYSTEEN: Yes. I don't remember the details how this assignment was made, but I
                    believe that the Office of Personnel (PER) told me that on the next assignment
                    cycle I would be slated for senior training. I had never been assigned to any
                    training. Having been integrated into the Foreign Service from the Civil
                    Service, I missed the initial training that most of my contemporaries had. That
                    may have influenced PER.</p>
                <p>Secondly, I had encountered Professor John Fairbank of Harvard, one of America's
                    most distinguished scholars of China and an acquaintance of both my parents and
                    parents-in-law. I found him fascinating. I remember that during a long cocktail
                    party toward the end of my tour in Tokyo, he and I found refuge in a bedroom
                    where we discussed a number of China issues, each with glass in hand. We never
                    did circulate among the guests. He asked me whether I would be interested in a
                    stint at the Fairbank Center at Harvard to write a paper or two and perhaps
                    teach a course. A couple of years later I was asked if I would like to attend
                    the Bowie Seminar at Harvard's Center for International Affairs. So with very
                    attractive offers from academia and PER's determination, I was assigned to
                    Harvard for senior training.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>I was a fellow at the “Bowie Seminar” of the Center for International Affairs for
                    the 1965-66 year and also attached informally to the Fairbank Center; I was
                    pleased; in those days, the fellowship had some prestige. The seminar included
                    fellows from the State Department and U.S. military services along with about 10
                    others from our NATO and Asian allies. Henry Kissinger was the director; he
                    lectured to us twice and attended several of our presentations but was on
                    sabbatical leave. Ralph Clough was the other State Department fellow. I divided
                    my time roughly evenly between the two institutions which worked very
                    cooperatively and have since been amalgamated.</p>
                <p>I wasted a lot of time when I first got to Harvard, trying to adjust to a new
                    life style, coping with a new baby, and lots of practical errands associated
                    with return to the U.S. after more than 10 years overseas. Eventually, things
                    fell into place, and I was able to get to academic work. I was really getting
                    the hang of academia when the year came to an end. I had a productive time at
                    Harvard. I felt the graduate schools there were superior to those of my Alma
                    Mater Yale; I think the undergraduate schools were on an equal level.</p>
                <p>I gave quite a few lectures at Harvard and undertook much public speaking in the
                    Boston area on China and East Asia. Ezra Vogel in particular asked me to speak
                    to a number of his classes. Most of the time I lectured on contemporary China
                    and Asia. At the seminar I wrote a major paper on American China policy, which I
                    have discussed before. I argued for a continuation of the current containment
                    policy except for recognition of the PRC, which I thought should be carried out
                    as soon as possible. I also favored abandonment of our ban on travel and
                    non-strategic trade. If such measures helped bring about an evolutionary change
                    in the harsh PRC regime, we could take additional steps - quite a cautious
                    approach, yet out of line with U.S. policy. While I don't remember the details,
                    I suspect my paper more or less foreshadowed the course we actually followed,
                    since I was part of the emerging, new orthodoxy in China thinking. I do recall
                    that the paper did not stress the Soviet factor; perhaps I should have covered
                    that angle more extensively. But I certainly would not have gone as far as Nixon
                    and Kissinger. I felt an effective triangular relationship between the U.S.,
                    USSR, and PRC needed balance, and might have to be carefully re-calibrated from
                    time to time. If we leaned too hard in either direction, we would handicap
                    ourselves.</p>

                <p>Harvard in some respects was like a candy jar. There were all sorts of nuggets
                    available. I was very busy studying and participating in the activities of the
                    Bowie Seminar and Fairbank Center as well as the talkathon on Vietnam and Asia
                    taking place at almost all schools including Harvard during those protest years.
                    I concentrated on Asia but I made some effort to improve my knowledge of Eastern
                    Europe and the Soviet Union. Harvard had a good Eastern Europe program; I
                    audited a number of courses at both the undergraduate and graduate levels. My
                    various activities amounted to a full academic work-load. Of all the courses I
                    took at Harvard the one that gave me most pleasure was taught by Benjamin
                    Schwarz on the history of Chinese thought. Schwartz had wowed me during my Yale
                    student days with a book entitled “Chinese Communism and the Rise of Mao,” a
                    brilliant book that broke through to the reality of how the Chinese Communists
                    came to power. He was a bit of a neophyte in his new realm of ancient history
                    but I gained much insight from him.</p>
                <p>The most difficult role for me at Harvard was one that State Department carved
                    out for me. They quite frequently asked me to speak publicly in the
                    Boston-Cambridge area in defense of U.S. policy toward Vietnam. I did so as well
                    as I could, treating it as a duty, but as I have already said I was personally
                    torn about what we should do in Vietnam. I had always been uneasy, if not
                    opposed, to picking up the French colonial burden in Indochina. When Ngo Dinh
                    Diem was overthrown, I remember telling my colleague Hey Isham in Hong Kong that
                    this was a very worrisome development, because I thought it would lead to
                    continuing and probably escalating U.S. involvement in Vietnam. That was one of
                    my better predictions. While I recognized a Soviet and Chinese hand in what the
                    North Vietnamese were doing, I considered the struggle in Vietnam largely as a
                    civil war in which the communists had skillfully captured the nationalist
                    mantle, leaving the South, and us, with residue of French rule. At the same time
                    I recognized the risks of a communist take over and hoped it would fail.</p>
                <p>Despite my pessimism about a successful outcome of the struggle, I had no moral
                    problem with our intervention in Vietnam; I simply did not think we could win a
                    contest with nationalism. I wobbled in this judgment for a brief period. While
                    visiting our MAAG and embassy officers in Vietnam, I found most of them very
                    positive about the “progress” South Vietnam was making in the military area. I
                    remained dubious, but as I left Hong Kong in 1965, I thought President Johnson
                    was probably right in deploying our marines to Da Nang. I soon reversed myself
                    as I watched failure after failure of the South Vietnamese regime invite further
                    escalation of our military actions. In short I was a skeptic of our policy and
                    known among my colleagues to be one.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>With views like these, it was tricky trying to publicly defend U.S. policy and
                    actions. My basic approach was to highlight North Vietnamese aggression, not
                    spend too much time on the wisdom of our response. It was an often uncomfortable
                    role, less so if the audience was conservative, more so if it consisted of
                    unruly protesters. Usually I would be part of a team of speakers or discussants.
                    Quite often I went with John Fairbank; I would support U.S. policy while he made
                    the case against intervention. Frequently, we would be joined by an extremist
                    who would rant against our involvement in Vietnam; such person would invariably
                    show up without tie, sloppily dressed, and violate the rules of polite
                    discourse. At times, we were joined by a fourth panelist.</p>
                <p>We held discussions on Vietnam before many different audiences. Some were large;
                    I remember one consisting of 3,000 women professionals, the largest audience I
                    have ever addressed. In this case the fourth speaker was Assistant Secretary of
                    State Bill Bundy, whom I knew and liked but with whom I had considerable
                    disagreement. Just before that occasion, Marshall Lin Biao, Mao Zedong's chosen
                    successor, had published an article describing the world as the Chinese
                    revolutionary scene writ large. The developed world or cities would be engulfed
                    by the communist revolution in the third world or rural areas of the globe. This
                    was great stuff for the U.S. administration struggling to justify what it was
                    doing in Vietnam. In a brief pre-talk conversation, I told Bundy I thought Lin's
                    article was rhetorical crap associated with the leadership struggle within
                    China, not a sign that China was about to join the battle in Vietnam. I repeated
                    this to the women in the audience; Bundy was less careful. On this occasion,
                    Fairbank and I were on the same side. Usually, I did not share his views on the
                    Vietnam; I thought that he was a bit naive on the subject.</p>
                <p>The nadir occurred when I was asked by the Department to speak on a panel
                    including my father-in-law, O. Edmund Clubb, an outspoken opponent of our
                    Vietnam policy. This would have put me in the position of arguing in public with
                    Clubb. That was not acceptable, and I told the Department I would not do it. It
                    is one of the few times I rebelled against a Departmental order.</p>
                <p>Not all the debate was public. Nor were all the Harvard crowd opposed to our
                    actions. Some of the “peace nicks” at Harvard, who a few years later descended
                    on Secretary of State Kissinger to protest the U.S. invasion of Cambodia, were
                    hawks in 1965. At the Center for International Affairs, run that year by a
                    mathematician, the preferred theory was one of “progressive escalation” in
                    Vietnam. I spent considerable time arguing against these ideas that struck me as
                    a recipe for disaster. These were good sessions and included some distinguished
                    and experienced foreigners at the Center. I could express my personal views and
                    did not have to defend the administration on matters on which we disagreed.
                    Outside the Center, I was a more or less defender of U.S. policy. This duality
                    was uncomfortable. On the other hand, I found audiences quite receptive to my
                    arguments. Student groups were less sympathetic than the general public - the
                    older the audience, the more sympathetic it was. General sentiment in the area
                    was one of questioning: why are we in Vietnam?</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>Q: In 1966, you were assigned to Bureau for International Organizations (I.0.) as
                    deputy director of the Office of UN Political Affairs (UNP). How did that
                    assignment come about?</p>
                <p>GLEYSTEEN: While at Harvard, I asked PER what onward assignments might be
                    available at the deputy office director level. I was told that the IO job might
                    be available, along with several other potential vacancies. It sounded
                    interesting to me. It is hard today to conjure up the ambience of the UN at that
                    time. The UN was near its peak of importance - that is, just before its steep
                    decline. In the second half of the 1960s, the UN was still a significant
                    consideration in our policy. Compared to today, it received far more attention
                    from the president and secretary of State; and we tried far harder to enlist
                    support for our points of view. I thought the IO job would be lively. I knew Joe
                    Sisco from my S/S days - he was a classmate of my colleague Dick Hennes and
                    through that link, I got to know him. When we started we were all about the same
                    level, but Joe soon left us far behind.</p>
                <p>I think many people would share my view that IO's prominence in the 1960s
                    reflected both the UN's importance and Joe Sisco's bureaucratic skills. His
                    deputies were Bill Buffum and David Popper. While I was in IO, Buffum moved on
                    to our mission to the UN; he was replaced by Popper. Toward the end of my tour,
                    Sisco left to become assistant secretary for NEA. He was replaced by Sam DePalma
                    in early 1969. I got along well with both men, which was important because my
                    activities involved them so much of the time.</p>
                <p>My immediate boss was Elizabeth Brown, a very capable officer and experienced in
                    the UN world. While I was learning the ropes, Jock Dean was the senior deputy. I
                    eventually replaced him, and Steve Campbell - an NEA expert and former Consul
                    General in Jerusalem - took over as the second deputy. Elizabeth was sick for
                    many months during my time in UNP, leaving me as acting director of the office.
                    That required touching base with the front office all the time - more than I
                    liked. The division of labor within UNP was complex, but it worked.</p>
                <p>We provided political and strategic guidance to our UN Mission. Sometimes, it was
                    just a matter of coordinating with other substantive bureaus of the Department
                    so that the U.S. government would speak with one voice. Other times, we were
                    more substantively involved, for example, in the resolution of the 1967
                    Arab-Israel war - which was the most complex subject that we tackled. We
                    operated in those tense days almost like an Operations Center with Sisco running
                    the show in Washington and Arthur Goldberg in New York. I was just a frustrated
                    leg-man for Sisco.</p>
                <p>Sisco's domination of the process was pronounced. If he were involved in one of
                    my subjects such as Chinese or Korean representation to the UN, he would call me
                    on the phone directly and ask me to come to his office. That may have been
                    efficient, but it left a lot of people out of the loop, particularly Elizabeth
                    Brown. I tried hard to keep her filled in. She was very gracious about it. I
                    found my informal relationship with Sisco satisfactory; I was always able to
                    communicate my points of views on various issues. He didn't agree much of the
                    time, but he heard me out.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>My personal responsibilities were: the decolonization process, which fell
                    primarily within the purview of the Trusteeship Council; Chinese representation;
                    Korean representation; Arab-Israeli and African issues - the latter two subjects
                    until Campbell came in. On some subjects, I knew little; I had to learn on the
                    job. I felt quite vulnerable, but I approached each of my issues with as much
                    common sense as I could muster. All in all, I think UNP demonstrated a competent
                    grasp of the issues and had a good reputation in other parts of the Department.
                    We were a kind of repository for knowledge about the UN, including the history
                    of its behavior, which was sometimes an important consideration in the conduct
                    of US policy.</p>
                <p>Functionally, IO's main task was to seek a consensus in Washington on any given
                    topic and then to instruct our delegation in New York. The mission would often
                    try to squirm out of those instructions to join the crowd in New York.
                    Washington was quite effective exercising control, and IO was remarkably
                    successful in protecting its monopoly over this process. Sisco was very
                    insistent about this and was able to force the bureaucracy to go through his
                    bureau on all UN - and other international organization - matters. When a bureau
                    tried to bypass IO, retribution was swift because Joe maintained excellent
                    relations with the secretary as well as the White House and sometimes with the
                    president himself. He was very good at that. Sam DePalma was not that close to
                    the secretary; he had a different personality from Sisco - he was more
                    intellectual - and the times were somewhat different.</p>
                <p>Some of us were activists, especially in the areas which we knew well-e.g. East
                    Asia for me. My background allowed me to play a significant role on Chinese
                    representation. The same for Korean representation. It helped of course that I
                    was familiar with the EA Bureau. As far as China was concerned, the U.S.
                    government - or at least Secretary of State Dean Rusk - was determined not let
                    “Red China” into the UN family, leaving Chiang Kai-shek's regime to represent
                    all of the Chinese people. I found it very difficult to carry out this policy;
                    along with many others I squirmed when I had to toe the U.S. line. Few other
                    countries sided with us. The policy was built on a myth - Chiang Kai-shek could
                    not possibly represent all of the Chinese people.</p>
                <p>In the battles over this issue we worked as co-equals with the EA Bureau. Much of
                    the EA Bureau shared my views, but those who didn't had powerful allies. In our
                    inter-agency committee of NSC and State representatives, Ruth Bacon and Louise
                    McNutt, both of the EA Bureau, were usually able to defeat all “bright new
                    ideas” largely because they knew they would be backed the secretary who rejected
                    the advice of “radicals” like me.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>The high point in this contest occurred in 1967 or 1968. A number of us,
                    including Bill Bundy's senior deputy, Win Brown, in EA favored a “two Chinas”
                    representation scheme. Although it would have greatly improved our tactical
                    position to advance such a formula, my guess is that the PRC in 1967 would have
                    rejected our proposal; conceivably, it might have been more flexible ten years
                    earlier. Knowing that the idea was an anathema to Secretary Rusk, the EA
                    hierarchy was not in the mood for a major battle with Secretary Rusk, but being
                    the main IO staffer on this issue, I decided to engage in some rather
                    adventuresome free-wheeling.</p>
                <p>I knew there was some inclination in the White House for a policy change, and I
                    used my contacts to explore high level backing for a new approach. As I recall,
                    my contacts were Al Jenkins, a Foreign Service officer who had the East Asia
                    portfolio in the NSC, and Jim Thompson, who had come from Harvard during the
                    Kennedy Administration and told me he thought Kennedy would have wanted to
                    change our Chinese representation policy after the 1964 election. Thompson
                    arranged for me to see Bill Moyers, who was a key aide to President Johnson.
                    Moyers liked the idea of dual representation and thought it would appeal to the
                    President. Although I am not absolutely sure, I believe Moyers got informal
                    approval from the President.</p>
                <p>The PRC under our suggestion would have had a seat in the Security Council and
                    General Assembly; Taiwan would continue to have been represented in the
                    Assembly. The Japanese and Canadians were anxious to have such a resolution
                    passed - probably because they took so much heat from us on recognition and
                    representation issues.</p>
                <p>On my own initiative I approached the Canadians, keeping the IO leadership
                    informed about what I was doing. Since I periodically hiked with a key member of
                    the Canadian Embassy, I used that venue to exchange views informally. The
                    Canadians proved eager to push the dual representation idea. Emboldened by my
                    White House excursion and talks with the Canadians and Japanese, Sisco joined
                    the effort to change the State Department's position. At a meeting with Acting
                    Secretary Katzenbach, IO and EA, somewhat unbelievably, got his agreement to
                    seek formal White House agreement to support a Canadian resolution calling for
                    dual representation. I really thought I was a hero; even if rejected by the PRC,
                    the new formula would have left us - and Taiwan - in a much better defensive
                    position.</p>
                <p>My illusions didn't last long. The secretary was out of the country at a NATO
                    meeting when we went to see Katzenbach. As soon as he came back, Rusk swiftly
                    over-ruled his under secretary, and I had the unhappy task of telling my
                    Canadian and Japanese counterparts that we had failed. Dean Rusk was the
                    complete boss on this issue. Despite Moyer's efforts, I doubt President Johnson
                    cared that much about China. In any event, the PRC would have shot us down.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>Because of my China experience, I was involved on the periphery of the Warsaw
                    talks conducted between the PRC and ourselves. Although there was no direct UN
                    connection, I was privy to what was going on in the Sino-US discussions - thanks
                    to my colleagues in EA, particularly Paul Kreisberg who handled the staff work
                    on those talks. In my UNP capacity I also worked on policy papers clearing
                    through IO. When Nixon became President in 1969, Kissinger ordered a major study
                    of the China situation - a tactic designed in part to ensure that the
                    bureaucracy was deeply engaged in paper pushing while the NSC advisor was free
                    to take his own actions in secret. I remember our producing a rather competent
                    comprehensive paper on all aspects of our policy. It was make-work, but we
                    didn't realize that until later. Our recommendations were sensible if modest in
                    light of the major breakthrough managed by Nixon and Kissinger. I sustained this
                    China connection when I moved to INR where I was in charge of the EA office. I
                    vividly recall revisiting these Washington struggles when I learned in Taipei
                    that Kissinger had traveled secretly to Beijing.</p>
                <p>My most uncomfortable moments in UNP were during the 1967 Arab-Israeli War. We
                    were initially inclined to support a cease-fire calling on the forces of both
                    sides to retreat back to their own lines. I firmly believed in that principle,
                    and our legal advisor was very much in sympathy with it, but he was summarily
                    over-ruled, because of strong opposition within the Executive Branch and
                    Congress - most of it activated by Jewish communities in this country.
                    Ambassador Goldberg insisted on a cease-fire in place, which left Israel with
                    enormous amounts of captured Arab territory. His position and Sisco's
                    “sensitivity” to the Jewish community in the U.S. reinforced White House
                    instincts to allow the Israelis keep the conquered territory. I watched with
                    dismay how the original U.S. position was transformed into the final one.
                    Pressure was applied in Congress and throughout the government hierarchy. I have
                    already mentioned Goldberg's role. In the White House, National Security Advisor
                    Walt Rostow sounded like Netanyahu does today. I overheard some conversations
                    between Sisco and Rostow which really demoralized me - it was legal and common
                    practice for staffers to monitor calls in those days. I was naive about domestic
                    politics in 1967. Nevertheless, I still feel that the U.S. could have handled
                    the aftermath of the war so that Israel was protected without generating a major
                    backlash in the Arab world and making the eventual settlement more difficult to
                    achieve.</p>
                <p>Another facet of the problem in 1967 was the speed with which a settlement
                    acceptable to both sides would be enforced. To my astonishment, there was a
                    rather shameless effort to slow the cease fire so Israel could consolidate its
                    gains in Syria - at some risk of Soviet counteraction. IO played a major role in
                    the entire crisis, because so much of the activity on the Arab side was at the
                    UN. The Arabs enjoyed a large majority of supporters in the General Assembly,
                    including the Soviets, and could pass pro-Palestinian resolutions. We used the
                    Security Council and our considerable influence in general to block them. When I
                    drafted talking points for Goldberg's use, they were usually changed by Sisco
                    and others, much to my displeasure. I complained vociferously within the
                    Department; I suspect that Sisco might well remember my behavior at the time.
                    NEA officers often held views similar to mine, but of the senior officers in IO
                    only Elizabeth Brown agreed with me. I learned a lot about the UN - and
                    Washington - in a very short time.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Although I had a high regard for Sisco, which is clear in my remarks, I
                    nevertheless realized he was an American apparatchik — on his way rapidly up the
                    bureaucratic ladder and not inclined to spend much time indulging doubts about
                    U.S. policy. David Popper was even less willing to stick his neck out. I
                    frequently clashed with him in heated discussions on what U.S. policy should be.
                    Sisco in his heart of hearts may have agreed with me, but he was not going to
                    challenge the White House. Going along was an important aspect of success in the
                    upper reaches of the bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>UNP gave me a much stronger sense than my S/S experience of how domestic
                    constituencies impacted on foreign policy and the need to take these into
                    account if one were to be successful in dealing with a crisis. My first
                    encounter was with the “China lobby,” essentially an ideological struggle. The
                    Arab-Israeli war demonstrated the power of a different kind of constituency, the
                    ethnic or religious ones that are so prevalent today.</p>
                <p>UNP also exposed me to bureaucratic cowardice; more than in my S/S days I found
                    that a lot of people who felt as I did, did not speak up in important meetings
                    on controversial issues and went along with administration policies, assuming
                    they should not be blamed if things went awry. Both these phenomena discouraged
                    me, but after a while, I accepted them as reflections of the world as it is.</p>
                <p>After 1967, the value of the UN to the U.S. started to diminish, and there was an
                    erosion of our interest in matters being confronted in New York. Americans were
                    not happy with the way the UN had handled the Arab-Israel war. Many Americans,
                    including my oldest and non-Foreign Service brother, sympathized with the
                    apparent underdog. They felt the Arabs and Soviets had manipulated the UN in an
                    effort to counter Israel's “plucky” behavior - and, of course, military
                    superiority. The UN was down-graded and trampled over by many of our actions
                    with a negative effect on the UN and its staff. But the 1967 war was not the
                    underlying cause of the UN's downfall. I am more inclined to attribute the
                    downward slide to the UN's unfortunate predilection to grow like Topsy; it had
                    become top heavy and kept expanding more every year. Coupled with that was an
                    aging leadership, inefficiency, as well as some corruption of senior officials.
                    For example, economic development for the Third World was getting out of hand.
                    It was a very expensive operation that was hard to justify in terms of
                    significant accomplishment.</p>
                <p>There were also a number of less important issues, like Micronesia, where the
                    anti- colonial factions in the UN harassed us in New York on every aspect of our
                    administration of those islands. That was not well received in Washington; nor
                    were the continual attacks on our Vietnam policies. By this time, all of these
                    issues had begun to wear on Washington and American society, generating a
                    back-lash against the UN. I'm not sure whether it was a factor in Sisco's
                    decision to move to NEA. Probably not. In any event, Sam DePalma handled this
                    new situation with considerable aplomb, but no individual could have reversed
                    the trend.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>As part of my responsibility in UNP for Korean matters, I was part of the task
                    force established after North Korea's capture of the USS Pueblo. We in IO were
                    not central players, but New York was a communications point and there were UN
                    aspects to be considered. For example, Goldberg was instructed several times to
                    brief the Security Council with charts and other visuals - I remember preparing
                    him for a complex presentation in the company of Sisco. It was a tense period; I
                    did not participate in the final resolution - which I found quite humiliating
                    for the U.S.. IO was involved only very peripherally; the key players were in EA
                    and Defense - and the White House.</p>
                <p>The UN Security Council was also convened to hear our bitter protests in 1968
                    when North Koreans agents tried to attack the Blue House - President Park Chung
                    Hee's official residence. There wasn't much the US could do about this brazen
                    attack which caused the South Koreans to yell bloody murder and cite it a reason
                    why the North should never be allowed into the UN.</p>
                <p>Understandably, these incidents raised the level of U.S. Government concern about
                    North Korea. In the 1950s and early 1960s, we tended to believe that stability
                    on the peninsula could be maintained effectively by deterrent force - the South
                    Koreans plus U.S. forces along and near the border; we still had a powerful
                    military presence at the time. If there were problems with Pyongyang, we used
                    Soviet - and sometimes Chinese - intermediaries to remind the North Koreans of
                    the danger of escalation. We assumed that the PRC and the Soviet Union would
                    help keep their “client” under control, although we were less confident of this
                    after the bitter the Sino-Soviet rift. In the case of the Blue House raid,
                    however, both the PRC and the Soviet Union seemed surprised by North Korean's
                    behavior. They appeared to have less control than we had assumed, and the
                    attacks suggested there were real adventurers within the North Korean leadership
                    who did not mind taking big risks.</p>
                <p>The Blue House raid was a foolish and dangerous adventure that did not endear the
                    North Korean regime to anybody. And it came very close to success! Years later
                    as ambassador I was amazed when I was shown how a substantial North Korean force
                    managed to breach South Korean defenses, enter Seoul, and reach within a few
                    hundred meters of the Blue House before they were detected. That particular
                    action, following so soon after the Pueblo, really hardened our views on the
                    North and made us more vigilant and even less willing to compromise with a rogue
                    regime. Despite this, I thought then - and still do today - that a serious
                    military threat from the North could continue to be deterred by maintaining
                    sufficient strength - and without being overly provocative.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>On Micronesia, Don McHenry, a UNP recruit from Kennedy days who had been deeply
                    involved in trusteeship issues long before I, briefed me and taught me all I
                    know. The UN atmospherics were poor, because we were always defending ourselves
                    against attacks from the more revolutionary, anti-colonial countries - mostly
                    African ones. It was a very unpleasant experience, particularly in the General
                    Assembly's “Committee of 24” - which was larger than the Trusteeship Council and
                    far less courteous. That Committee included the worst rabble rousers in the UN.
                    I pushed hard for a decision to withdraw from the Committee, where we were just
                    cannon fodder for communist-supported radicals. This gradually became a majority
                    opinion, and we finally walked out of the Committee of 24 shortly after I left
                    IO. In fact, once we pulled out, the diatribes virtually ceased - there was no
                    longer any target except the French.</p>
                <p>There were some important issues associated with our role in Micronesia.
                    Technically, we were responsible to the Trusteeship Council for our stewardship
                    of the islands. That requirement was not part of the UN Charter, but we had
                    voluntarily submitted Micronesia to Trusteeship Council supervision. In the
                    Department of State, IO was the lead bureau for Micronesia; effectively, we were
                    the “Micronesia Desk,” but the Department of the Interior really ran the show.
                    It appointed governors, determined the use of resources, more or less
                    monopolized dealings with the Congress, etc. We couldn't do anything without
                    Interior's support. The Interior Department's staff was mediocre and hard to
                    convince.</p>
                <p>Micronesia was a collection of island groups that we had captured or recaptured
                    from the Japanese. They were gradually being weaned and encouraged to move
                    towards self-government. In keeping with Trusteeship Council sentiment we
                    treated the disparate islands as a single unit, and our over-riding concern at
                    the time was to keep the islands as US territory for security reasons. That
                    brought DoD into the mix of Washington bureaucracies working on Micronesia. The
                    military wanted access to the islands, regardless of their legal status.
                    Micronesia was a critically important test site for nuclear weapons and missile
                    programs. On the political side there was some concern that an independent
                    Micronesia might ally itself or be suborned by an unfriendly power such as the
                    USSR. Japan was also thought to have undue influence as a result of WW II
                    relationships and a generous aid program. So the discussions in Washington on
                    Micronesia tended to be quite vigorous.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>Defense had sensible people dealing with Micronesia. For the most part, one might
                    say that they were even enlightened. Many of the Interior representatives in
                    Washington had at one time or another been part of the paternalistic
                    administrative staff in Micronesia during the early post war period or learned
                    their ways from working with Indian reservations. The governors, when they came
                    to town, would meet with us, and I found that they too had relatively little
                    understanding of the political situation in Micronesia or the UN. Much of what
                    they thought was just plain wrong. So we had a very troublesome relationship
                    with the Interior staff. But we kept plugging away and eventually came to
                    agreement of proposals to be presented to the Trusteeship Council. Specifically,
                    we had to somehow permit the Micronesians to exercise genuine
                    self-determination, including the option of independence, while making sure that
                    the vote would come out our way-i.e. stay with the US.</p>
                <p>I was never able to visit Micronesia, and I regretted it, because each part of
                    the territory had its own views and unique problems. I did meet a number of
                    Micronesians -introduced to me by McHenry, giving me some feel for the local
                    situation, which was somewhat unstable. There were half a dozen island groups
                    and many different forces at work on the political system. I have already
                    mentioned the uninspired and vision less Interior staff as well as the security
                    concerns of Defense. Added to this mix, was Congressional anxiety about the
                    possibility of an American territory voting in favor of “independence.”</p>
                <p>Congress was not generous to Micronesia. They tended to neglect it in a way that
                    reminded me of our treatment of Native Americans. To its credit, the Executive
                    Branch thought a little generosity in advance would go a long way in heading off
                    radical solutions in the future. Congress was only half convinced by this
                    argument. Congressional oversight was exercised mostly by the House Insular
                    Affairs Committee, which was very jealous of its portfolio and always wanting
                    high level officials to appear before it rather than fellows like me. Among
                    several contenders for the title, Congressman Ed Koch was the most obnoxious.
                    For a very brief period, I was one of the two experts in the Department on
                    Micronesia. There wasn't much interest on the subject in the Department. Getting
                    seventh floor attention was extremely difficult.</p>
                <p>There were some less prominent factors that ultimately proved to be the key ones.
                    Among those I would list the divisions within Micronesia - the differing
                    attitudes of people living on different islands; relations or to some extent
                    rivalry with other territories such as Guam and other Pacific islands; the
                    attitudes of Australia and New Zealand which were essentially Micronesia's
                    neighbors and had relatively good track records on island administration; and
                    the Japanese with their trade, aid, and tourists. So we had a complex situation
                    which was frustrating at times, but always challenging.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>I must say that during my watch, there was very little advance on the question of
                    Micronesia's future status. We went back and forth on the options, but nothing
                    was ever decided definitively. As a general proposition, the U.S. government
                    worried about Micronesian independence, although there were individuals here and
                    there who supported the idea. Some of our staff in New York seemed overly
                    devoted to the principle of self-determination. McHenry may have leaned the same
                    way; he had been dealing with de-colonization in Africa and that undoubtedly had
                    an impact on his views of Micronesia. The Department of State's main concern was
                    that the U.S. government not violate the UN charter. Rather cynically, we
                    envisaged a carefully organized act of self-determination, lubricated by
                    substantial assistance to ensure the right result. To put it bluntly, we were
                    prepared to be accused of using a fig leaf. In those days EA had practically no
                    interest in the subject, leaving IO to take the lead.</p>
                <p>While IO had little direct responsibility for Indochina, domestic controversy
                    over our Vietnam policy boiled over during the years I was in UNP. As I have
                    explained elsewhere, I was very uneasy over our entanglement, and by this time I
                    was eager to find a decent or semi-decent way out. At the same time I objected
                    to the behavior of the often mindless militants on our streets. I never joined
                    the public outcry; I always tried to be disciplined and fight internally for my
                    views. I don't think I was a hero in this process.</p>
                <p>A few months before the Tet Offensive, Sisco had me accompany him during a week's
                    visit to Vietnam where we received VIP treatment, getting all over the place and
                    seeing all the important Americans, including Ambassador Bunker, General
                    Westmoreland, and many regional commanders and advisors. I remember being
                    impressed with the massiveness of the American intervention and the extent of
                    real dedication. Yet, victory seemed impossible; the prospect was for a long
                    drawn out contest that could not be sustained politically back home.
                    Westmoreland struck me as an unbright, uninspired officer with ideas that would
                    only dig the hole deeper. At the time he wanted to “cut” the Ho Chi Min trail
                    using “just two additional US divisions,” which he was requesting, to establish
                    a cordon sanitaire across Vietnam and Laos. His own chief of staff told me it
                    was a loony idea. I helped Sisco write his report to Secretary Rusk; it was less
                    outspoken than it would have been under my name. The malaise of Vietnam was
                    beginning to color all our work in 1967-68; it was a profoundly depressing
                    period.</p>
                <p>I would like to say a few words about the Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) that was
                    negotiated while I was in IO. Gerry Helman headed up a small office in UNP on
                    arms control matters. I became peripherally involved because of my knowledge of
                    Japan and other Asian countries. My brother Culver was a key person in ACDA on
                    this matter; he and Sisco often talked to each other without reaching agreement.
                    That made my role somewhat uncomfortable, caught between my boss and my brother.
                    Culver was pushing very hard to get approval of the NPT, as was Sisco. I no
                    longer remember why they were always fighting; I think Culver thought we were
                    being too soft on the Japanese who were trying to water down the Treaty. In any
                    event, several times I undertook a peace mission, the price paid for being one
                    three brothers in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>By 1969, I had come to the conclusion that the UN was an essential attribute for
                    carrying out the burdens of the developed world. The issue which had the
                    greatest impact on me was the Arab-Israel war and the UN's role in resolving
                    some of the issues arising from it. My experience suggested that the UN was an
                    important institution, but not as important as Sisco and Goldberg thought and
                    argued. In fact, it was clear that both in the Administration and Congress there
                    were sufficient numbers of skeptics to limit our participation in the UN. These
                    forces kept us on a short leash and I didn't see any prospect that the situation
                    would change for the better. This was a kind of realpolitik limitation.</p>
                <p>There were nevertheless important UN functions. I thought the annual ministerial
                    meetings in New York were important; in the late 1960s those meetings were much
                    more substantive than they have become. We did not have the G-7 or all the other
                    meetings of today, so that the annual New York sessions were really valuable. I
                    agreed with the cliche that if the UN did nothing else, these annual meetings
                    made it a worthwhile institution.</p>
                <p>I also thought that the Security Council debates were worthwhile, unlike the
                    General Assembly which was already out of control. The speeches and actions of
                    the Assembly made no contribution whatsoever to the maintenance of world
                    stability. Their inflammatory rhetoric provided ammunition to anti-UN members of
                    Congress.</p>
                <p>Unlike today, the media gave considerable coverage to UN affairs. When a major
                    event occurred - the war in the Congo, seizure of the Pueblo, blow ups in the
                    Middle East, or communist crackdowns in Budapest and Prague - UN proceedings
                    were headline news and the subject of prime time network discussion. Full texts
                    of the US Delegate's remarks were carried by major newspapers. The UN was a real
                    player on the international stage. The UN also got lots of credit for
                    peace-keeping. I was an optimist about that process, which I thought would
                    become increasingly important.</p>
                <p>There was another area where I hoped the UN might prove useful as a kind of
                    umbrella. That was disarmament and arms control. Unfortunately, the organization
                    did not rise to the challenge; it played some helpful roles, as in the NPT, but
                    was generally upstaged by great power negotiations.</p>
                <p>The abuses in the UN that later caused a backlash in the US were fairly prevalent
                    by the end of the 1960s. The UNDP was established while I was in IO, and I could
                    see disaster ahead for all UN development programs. The UN budget kept going up;
                    the Soviets and others refused to pay their share thereby raising the assessment
                    of others. The other factor in the UN's slide was the negative role of the
                    Soviets in the Security Council enforced by their veto. Ironically, we now fail
                    to pay dues, provide little aid, and use the veto quite freely.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>Unfortunately, the limits of the UN were also pretty apparent. When it came to
                    any kind of governmental function - chapter seven peace keeping - that involved
                    military action, the UN faded into the background. Other countries took on the
                    burden - sometimes in the name of the UN. By the end of the 1960s the UN held
                    only modest promise. I was concerned that it would end up like the League of
                    Nations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1969 you became the Director of EAP in the Bureau
                        foIntelligence and Research (INR). How did you get that job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLEYSTEEN: I was restive after three years in UN/P. Although there wasn't a
                    logical vacancy in the EA Bureau, I was anxious to return to East Asia, and Tom
                    Hughes, the head of INR, managed to convince me that INR would be a good East
                    Asian assignment. I didn't know Hughes but he seemed to be aware of my record; I
                    think Joe Yager, then a member of S/P, might have mentioned me to him. My
                    immediate predecessors in INR, John Holdridge and Alan Whiting, also may have
                    been involved.</p>
                <p>As these things happen, by the time I actually reported to INR, Hughes had left
                    and was replaced by Ray Cline. Ray had been the CIA station chief in Taiwan
                    toward the end of my first tour in Taiwan. Later, I saw a lot of him in Hong
                    Kong when he was the director of the EA Division at CIA. I considered Cline a
                    member of the rambunctious school of policy advocates - often entertaining
                    dangerous ideas. That perception gave me pause because I didn't think that he
                    and I could work on the same wave-length - particularly on China/Taiwan,
                    Vietnam, and Cambodia. When I spoke to him about my reservations, Cline assured
                    me that we wouldn't have any problems, and that is how it worked out, except
                    possibly in one or two instances. He always forwarded my memos to the secretary
                    or other senior officers; he never refused to see me. I think we had an “okay”
                    to “good” relationship. I appreciated his willingness to sign off on documents
                    with which he might not have agreed. In general, I sensed that he respected
                    me.</p>
                <p>David Mark, one of Cline's deputies, more or less supervised our work on Asian
                    matters. He was unfamiliar with the Asian scene and sometimes tiresome, but he
                    was intelligent. INR mimicked the structure of the geographical bureaus and some
                    of the functional ones. INR tried to maintain overall integration of operations
                    through weekly staff meetings and other devices. However, most of our dealings
                    were with the regional bureaus, CIA, and the Defense intelligence organizations
                    - the so called intelligence community.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>I was lucky to have an outstanding deputy, Evelyn Colbert, a shrewd East Asia
                    hand and veteran of the intelligence community. She had been a deputy to several
                    of my predecessors and probably would have outshone all of us as the office
                    director. She devoted lots of time to my training, and as much as possible I
                    tried to treat her as an equal. Evelyn stood out for her sharp mind,
                    intellectual rigor, and common sense. She was also a superb editor, who helped
                    the whole staff, myself included, with our extensive writing. Although I thought
                    I was a fairly good writer, I quickly learned that she could improve my
                    work.</p>
                <p>We had 15 to 20 analysts working in INR/EAP. This was the first time that I had
                    been fully responsible for such a large staff. When I was the acting chief of
                    section in Hong Kong I had considerable supervisory responsibility, but in INR I
                    was the designated person with responsibility for hiring, firing, and
                    performance. Our biggest contingent worked on Indochina and the next largest was
                    devoted to China and Taiwan. The staff included some very talented people; they
                    performed well and worked very hard - much of the time autonomously. Their
                    analysis was often done with little supervision from me. I concentrated on
                    problem areas; i.e. China, Vietnam, and Korea.</p>
                <p>In my INR days, I spent quite a bit of time counseling, recruiting and writing
                    efficiency ratings. At times I was a bit tough on individuals, perhaps applying
                    standards of excellence that I later realized were unrealistic. As always in the
                    government, I was expected to keep most of the staff I inherited, but there was
                    some turnover. Getting first class replacements, especially from the Foreign
                    Service, was difficult but not impossible. INR was not considered a jazzy
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>One of Evelyn's most useful assets was her grasp of staff capabilities and
                    liabilities. Well before I assumed my new duties, she told me bluntly what she
                    thought should be done to improve the staff, particularly removal of people who
                    clearly were not carrying their weight. Although she had tried to get Holdridge
                    to act, he did not get around to it before his departure. I also postponed any
                    drastic moves until I could reach my own independent judgment. However, I soon
                    reached the same conclusion as Evelyn. After great moral anguish and a
                    cumbersome bureaucratic process, I managed to have two fairly senior officers
                    transferred out. Both worked on Indochina - one was the head of the South
                    Vietnam unit, an experienced civil servant, a nice man, and very knowledgeable
                    about Vietnam. He was, nevertheless, unable to get much out of his relatively
                    large staff. He also suffered from indecision. Since we were at war in Vietnam,
                    our intelligence judgments were important to the Department's senior officials.
                    If we could not support one point of view or another, our value was severely
                    diminished. Mostly we got promises of reports and few deliveries. I felt very
                    badly about what I did to him, but he bounced back and eventually retired from
                    INR as a deputy office director.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>The other individual was new to East Asia, having been recruited from propaganda
                    agencies working on East Germany and the Soviet Union to help us decipher what
                    the communists in Hanoi might be thinking. He was full of theories, couldn't
                    focus, and never produced anything useful, not even in his oral comments. I got
                    him transferred, despite some strong pressure from EA not do so - personal
                    friendships. I suggested EA take him on, which they declined, and he ended up in
                    the NSC where he worked without distinction in a number of offices. These
                    removals, the first I had ever initiated, were most distressing to me; from the
                    viewpoint of the system, the individuals were serious liabilities; from the
                    viewpoint of the individuals, we were hurting people who thought they were
                    making a contribution.</p>
                <p>Even before my assignment I had developed some “feel” for INR's role as a result
                    of my Hong Kong days where I was a recipient of - and distant contributor to -
                    INR's product. I also had some contact with INR from Tokyo as well as in IO. I
                    knew what INR was supposed to do and what it produced. I always assumed that its
                    most important function was to keep the secretary informed of significant
                    intelligence and analytical developments. This was the aspect of the job that
                    often brought me into direct contact with Ray Cline.</p>
                <p>Almost as important as keeping the Department's senior officials informed, we
                    were responsible for liaison with the intelligence community. We tried to ensure
                    that the intelligence product was a good as it could be - despite powerful
                    tendencies to leave debates unresolved with footnotes or bridged with fuzzy
                    language. Evelyn took the lead in the CIA liaison function. Occasionally, I
                    would get involved in areas of special interest to me.</p>
                <p>Although I initially thought that our principal client would be the secretary, I
                    soon found that one of our most important collaborators was the EA Bureau.
                    Marshall Green was the assistant secretary and I briefed him every day and gave
                    him a selection of materials to read. He rarely missed these meetings; when he
                    was otherwise occupied, he would call me sometime during the day to come to his
                    office. He was frank with me and used me as a sounding board. We had many
                    discussions about policies and events in EA. I or a member of my staff attended
                    EA staff meetings. Marshall would often task us to do research and analysis -
                    sometimes collaboratively with EA, sometimes on our own. He valued our
                    contributions as a means of corroborating or challenging information that he was
                    receiving from others.</p>
                <p>As far as the seventh floor was concerned, we didn't get tasked very much by the
                    secretary or his principals, leaving us room to choose subjects that we thought
                    would be of interest. I focused mostly on China and Vietnam. In the case of
                    China, I hoped our analysis of China's international behavior and domestic
                    developments, particularly shifts in the Chinese leadership, might have some
                    impact on our policy vis-a-vis the PRC. Nick Platt, who had worked with me in
                    Hong Kong, was very good at extracting essential information for our clients. In
                    the case of Vietnam, we tried hard to convey objectivity, often struggling
                    against the tendency of Defense, CIA, Embassy Saigon, and our own Ray Cline to
                    justify our policy in the face of doubtful data.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>We drafted many memos on these and other topics. Perhaps a few of them got into
                    the secretary's hands, but most were read by seventh floor staff or used by
                    Cline in his briefings. Occasionally, we would get a request to supplement a
                    memo to the secretary. I must say that I got relatively little satisfaction from
                    the small result of this time consuming process. With the partial exception of
                    Ray Cline, INR was quite remote from seventh floor policy deliberations.</p>
                <p>There were a few occasions when the secretary wanted a briefing on an EA subject
                    and Cline would take me along with him as a senior staff member and information
                    resource. I remember trying to brief Secretary Rogers and the deputy secretary
                    on Cambodia in the wake of our “incursion” into that country. Before he became
                    secretary, I had worked with Rogers in IO when he was brought in to serve in
                    some capacity in the UN South African effort. He was a bluff, pleasant man who
                    usually didn't realize how he easily he was bypassed by Kissinger. In this case,
                    he was stunningly ignorant of what we were doing or its implications - even
                    though he had theoretically been consulted by the White House. I suspect both my
                    disapproval of this retrograde action and my cynicism about capturing the
                    communist headquarters were fairly transparent. But I was asked back several
                    times to continue the story of how our military forces were frustrated in their
                    quest. The briefings at least permitted Secretary Rogers to keep up appearances
                    with NSC Advisor Kissinger.I think we saw all of the intelligence community's
                    output. In any case, Evelyn Colbert and I were exposed to more sensitive
                    material than most people working on East Asian matters. We were cleared to see
                    all varieties of classified material - much more than we could possibly absorb.
                    The avalanche of paper created major management problems for me. We could only
                    read the highly sensitive material in our special file room; Evelyn would
                    usually comb through it first and then I would select material to show Green.
                    Without others pre-selecting stuff for us, we would have spent the whole day in
                    the file room. There was some compartmentalization within the staff; analysts
                    did not have access to special materials that were not germane to their our
                    work; only Evelyn and I had across-the-board access.</p>
                <p>Our analysis was based essentially on the wide variety of reports received,
                    although most of the staff were fully familiar with their areas of
                    specialization through service abroad, education, and travel. Occasionally, some
                    of them were detailed for short periods to a foreign post, such as Saigon, but
                    that was infrequent. I traveled a little bit myself.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>INR was not in the policy chain of command. Its influence, if any, came from the
                    authority of its interpretation of what was happening and what might happen to
                    affect policy considerations. In meetings with the secretary and others, I'm
                    sure Ray Cline felt free to argue for or against policies, and, as I will
                    discuss later, I did this orally with Marshall Green and less senior people in
                    the Department. Our written product, however, was supposed to have a policy
                    neutral tone. Even if we were being selective in our focus and deliberately
                    highlighting certain dangers or opportunities, our written comments did not
                    contain policy recommendations. Any policy views were implicit. Almost all of
                    our product, whether a regular intelligence report or special memo, religiously
                    observed this rule, giving our product an unbiased look - but also reducing its
                    attraction to busy operators.</p>
                <p>There were exceptions to this practice. If the secretary were to ask Ray Cline
                    about some issue, Cline might ask us to draft a response touching directly on
                    policy choices. I would carefully review such draft with Ray who tended to tone
                    down our views, but usually allowed a semblance of them to survive in our final
                    product. More frequently than the secretary, Marshall Green would ask for policy
                    comments from the perspective of an “objective” intelligence analysis. Most of
                    our responses to these queries were oral, but some were written. I did not need
                    to clear this kind of response with our front office; I felt free to speak my
                    mind and to let our analysts do the same, even if I did not agree with their
                    conclusions. I could, of course, make my own views clearone way or another. I
                    doubt that this policy effort made a great difference to the course of events,
                    although I like to think we made a useful contribution to sensible decisions. In
                    any event, it was always clear to our consumers which of our products was
                    straight analysis and which was policy commentary - each was labeled.</p>
                <p>By the time I got to IO and then INR, I had an opinion on many of the hot issues.
                    It is very hard for an analyst to be completely objective when his or her mind
                    is bent in a certain direction. Although, as I have said, we did our very best
                    to be objective in our written assessments, I felt far freer to be opinionated
                    in oral comments. For example, I was a longstanding proponent of formal
                    relations between the US and the PRC, and in my IO days I sometimes pushed this
                    view to the annoyance of my superiors - who to their credit never censored
                    me.</p>
                <p>When Nixon came in, I was concerned that we were about to go backwards; having
                    overlooked his famous 1967 article in Foreign Affairs, I viewed him too simply
                    as a strong anti-communist who would never deal with the PRC. Of course, we had
                    no inkling of Nixon's and Kissinger's machinations. NSMs kept coming from the
                    White House; studies were tasked and recommendations options prepared - in part
                    to throw the bureaucracy off the track. Because we feared a conservative
                    backlash from Nixon, we were pretty timid in the recommendations of these
                    papers. But we did manage to get some good ideas into the analysis and we hoped
                    we could at least work on the assistant secretaries - and by influencing them
                    perhaps influencing the policy makers on the seventh floor.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>I lobbied quite vigorously with Marshall on the question of PRC recognition. I
                    made clear that normalization with the PRC should take place without undermining
                    Taiwan, because we had a responsibility for its security as part of our
                    long-range strategy in Asia. Marshall heard me out with great sympathy. Both of
                    us thought we were doing our duty, and we were both completely unaware of goings
                    on in the White House. Marshall and the whole Department were cut out of Nixon's
                    and Kissinger's secret maneuvers on China. Nixon and Kissinger took the boldest
                    steps of all options; our timidity must have amused them. I didn't learn about
                    any of this until I after I had left INR and arrived at my next assignment in
                    Taipei in 1971.</p>
                <p>Although this central policy issue was always on my mind, most of our China
                    efforts were devoted to such matters as Chinese policy toward Indochina,
                    Sino-Soviet relations that had ratcheted dangerously towards war, and obscure
                    but important leadership developments during the latter phases of the Cultural
                    Revolution. Even if it was hard to document, change was in the air. The Soviets
                    began a massive buildup of forces on the Chinese border, and the Chinese
                    responded with a considerable buildup of their own forces, including
                    construction of huge fortress-like structures that were fascinating to our
                    intelligence community. In this tense atmosphere the Soviets tried to inveigle
                    us into colluding with a nuclear threat to China. Out of the same fear, the
                    Chinese were being more responsive in their talks with us in Warsaw, through
                    “ping pong diplomacy” - and, completely unbeknownst to us, in their dealings
                    with Nixon and Kissinger.</p>
                <p>I was less organized about my views on Indochina. Even though I never considered
                    myself a specialist in the area, I was very interested in Vietnam, which had
                    become so central and pivotal to our foreign policy. My first brush with Vietnam
                    was during the Geneva Conference in 1955, which I described earlier. After I
                    returned to S/S, I worked for a while with Ambassador McClintock, an articulate
                    and cock-sure Foreign Service officer who had just returned from being charge in
                    Saigon. He was working with the JCS on post-Geneva arrangements. I may be doing
                    him a disservice, but he seemed to me to be insufficiently critical of the
                    French record in Indochina and too comfortable with our taking over their role
                    through military assistance etc. I opposed that approach very strongly, as I had
                    in Geneva. I felt the problems in Indochina should not and could not be solved
                    by more colonialism. I argued for staying out of Indochina.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>I have already talked at some length about my views on subsequent developments.
                    While in IO I had become convinced the President would have to disengage from
                    Vietnam either through the Paris talks or unilateral measures. I can't remember
                    all the stages through which this general feeling led me to favor relatively
                    rapid withdrawal from Vietnam. The Guam Doctrine, for which Marshall Green
                    claimed some credit, and growing talk of “Vietnamization” were portents of the
                    way we were likely to move, and I reacted favorably to the approach. But the
                    process seemed to be dragging out too long, and by the time of our Cambodian
                    venture in 1970 I was convinced we needed to expedite our withdrawal. Although I
                    had no confidence the South Vietnamese would be able to hold off North
                    Vietnamese encroachment, I saw no alternative that would be tolerated by the
                    American public. Complete withdrawal seemed the only way out of a messy
                    situation. Many people would suffer, but I discounted prophecies of dominoes
                    falling throughout Southeast Asia. I was confident that the communists would be
                    constrained by nationalist rivalries and healthier conditions in most other
                    countries.</p>
                <p>This was the basic trend of my thoughts about Vietnam, but I did not feel
                    sufficiently clear in my own mind to join any crusade in Washington. I never
                    believed we were “morally” wrong to engage ourselves in Vietnam even if we were
                    unwise to do so; I did not have friendly feelings toward the communist forces
                    attacking South Vietnam; and I had real distaste for the protest tactics being
                    employed in Washington and elsewhere in the nation. The closest I came to public
                    protest was to write a letter resigning from the American Foreign Service
                    Association, because its president and journal took the unusual step of publicly
                    endorsing the administration's actions in Cambodia and Vietnam. However, I was
                    never associated in any way with the group who chose to resign from the Foreign
                    Service - and return in high places when the war was over.</p>
                <p>Ray Cline was far more supportive than I of the administration as were many
                    members of my members of my staff. There was no prevailing doctrine among us. I
                    discussed my ideas with Marshall Green and others in EA, doing so more by
                    expressing deep skepticism about what we were trying to do in Indochina than by
                    arguing with strong conviction about my alternative thoughts. Moreover, most of
                    the time we were not writing about or even discussing grand strategy. Instead we
                    were reporting on the lamentable quality of the South Vietnamese administration
                    and army, the counterproductive aspects of the harsh tactics employed by our
                    South Korean military allies in their search and destroy missions, the
                    “successes” or “failures” of this or that operation or program. Enormous amounts
                    of time were consumed in arguing about the effectiveness of our military
                    operations, including efforts to interdict the Ho Chi Minh trail.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>I also mentioned Korea as a special interest. I wanted us to examine the changing
                    relationships between the PRC, the Soviet Union, the US, and Japan. We could see
                    the shifts in PRC views towards us - even before the Kissinger visit to Beijing.
                    I wondered whether these shifts in the regional equilibrium might have an
                    influence on the Korean Peninsula, particularly the North. I kept prodding our
                    analysts to be on the lookout. I assumed that the changing relationships in the
                    communist world might have a beneficial impact on the Korean Peninsula, and I
                    hoped that any shifts might allow the North to seek better relations with the
                    South. Some contacts eventually took place with North-South Korean talks in 1972
                    after Nixon's visit to China. But in the late 1960s and beginning of the 70s I
                    must say that we kept looking in vain. All we heard on both sides of the DMZ was
                    a hard line.</p>
                <p>After the Pueblo incident and attempted North Korean raid on the Blue House,
                    North Korea shot down a US recognizance plane. The Nixon administration talked
                    tough, but didn't do much. I was struck by apparent Soviet sympathy for our
                    position and the lack of traditional Chinese support for the DPRK. These shifts
                    were not enough to affect to alter the mind set in Pyongyang.</p>
                <p>Economic issues were not one of our direct responsibilities, and I did not focus
                    on this important aspect of what was going on in East Asia. I was, of course,
                    fully aware of Japan's rapid growth, and I began to appreciate the surprising
                    degree of progress in Taiwan and South Korea - a change that significantly
                    intensified my interest in these two countries where I subsequently served.</p>
                <p>Like IO, my INR experience reinforced my view on the importance of being
                    imaginative about ways of getting one's views considered at higher levels. I
                    didn't rule out resorting to channels outside the prescribed process - although
                    I recognized that couldn't be done too often. This applied to my staff as well
                    as to me. If they wanted to use an unorthodox channel, I was prepared to
                    cooperate if they could make a convincing case. In my own case, I used all
                    channels available to get my point of view to the policy makers, even if the
                    intervention was extra-curricular. I should note that I was never really in the
                    chain of command on Vietnam issues. I did get sucked into the edges of the
                    quagmire in the mid 1960s. By the time I left INR our presence in Vietnam had
                    reached its zenith and the downward slide was under way. When I became one of EA
                    Assistant Secretary Phil Habib's deputies in 1974 our presence in Vietnam had
                    already become extremely tenuous. My main advice on Vietnam was to get out
                    faster before our domestic struggle spread its damage beyond Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Of the six years I spent in the US after my Hong Kong stint I spent less than two
                    years in INR, one of my shortest assailments. I suspect I am remembered by some
                    of my colleagues there as a kind of transient, and I might have been more
                    effective if I had stayed longer. Nevertheless, I took a job many people ducked,
                    and I tried to give it my best. In terms of my own experience it was good
                    training for later work in the EA Bureau.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1971, you were assigned as DCM of our Embassy in
                        Taipei. Hodid that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLEYSTEEN: When my tour in INR was coming to an end, I asked Marshall Green
                    whether there were any opportunities for me in the Far East. He sent me to Paul
                    Cleveland, who was then his executive assistant. Paul asked whether I would be
                    interested in the DCM position in Taiwan. I jumped at the chance.</p>
                <p>There was a possible hitch. I had known Ambassador McConaughy since Tokyo days
                    and got along well with him, but his views and mine were quite disparate on the
                    issue of policy toward the PRC. Marshall doubted that this would be a barrier; I
                    wanted to ask McConaughy personally. So I wrote him a letter. His reply was
                    gracious. Acknowledging our differences, he said that he respected my views and
                    did not believe they should adversely affect our working relations. I found that
                    to be generous to a fault; I don't think I would have accepted a DCM with views
                    so different from mine.</p>
                <p>As I reflect back on my second tour in Taiwan, four things come to mind: the
                    striking change within the embassy from the intellectually constipated,
                    conservative administration of Rankin to the humane if still conservative
                    approach of McConaughy; the stunning shift in our China policy that coincided
                    with my arrival; political changes within Taiwan; and the beginnings of real
                    prosperity on the island.</p>
                <p>In contrast to the 1950s, my policy views were never an issue during the second
                    round; Ambassador McConaughy treated me as trustworthy. We disagreed openly
                    about normalization of relations with the PRC and later we disagreed on what was
                    going to happen to Taiwan. These were gentlemanly disagreements. To some extent,
                    I think McConaughy - by now about 62 - understood that a new era in policy was
                    emerging and that he belonged to a generation that was passing from the scene.
                    In any event, he was showing his age. He no longer defended his position with
                    the verve he used to display. He had already decided this Taiwan assignment was
                    to be his last, and he allowed me - even encouraged me - to do things that I,
                    had I been ambassador, would have reserved for myself. For example, I wrote the
                    commentaries on reports of his meetings with Premier Chiang Ching-kuo and his
                    father, President Chiang Kai-shek. I tried hard to avoid any obvious disjuncture
                    with his opinions, but inevitably there was a new flavor of the changing times.
                    I suspect Washington may have been amazed sometimes by the ambassador's
                    commentaries which were much more in tune with its thinking than previously. The
                    same was true for assessments of developments in Taiwan and the region. He let
                    me proceed with my analysis and encouraged me to express my views, for example
                    in a briefing of Congressmen where we were both present. I never dared ask him
                    why he was giving me so much leeway, but I don't think our differences led to
                    any serious problems and they may have well have served a useful purpose.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>Our staff knew of our differences. Political section officers more or less shared
                    my opinions, and if they encountered difficulties with the ambassador, they
                    would come to me, assuming I could take care of it. Bill Morell, the economic
                    counselor and a very savvy older officer who had been in Taiwan for quite a long
                    time, understood the economy far better than I and also felt confident of his
                    political grasp. Of the key officers he was the only one who leaned decidedly in
                    the ambassador's direction. There were a few occasions early on when he felt
                    that the ambassador would be more sympathetic than I and got his approval before
                    talking to me. That practice didn't last very long. Morell, who was a good man,
                    became a good friend and we worked cooperatively.</p>
                <p>Although we obviously didn't advertise our differences to people on the outside,
                    government officials and political leaders - both the Kuomintang and Taiwanese
                    opposition elements - were certainly aware of them.</p>
                <p>The ambassador and I carried on in friendly disagreement for about two years. In
                    1974 he was replaced by Leonard Unger, following a gap during which I acted as
                    charge'. Unger asked me to stay for the balance of my tour. This was after
                    President Nixon's visit to PRC and the Shanghai Communique, a watershed
                    development in East Asia that fundamentally changed the environment of our China
                    policy.</p>
                <p>The overwhelming event for me in Taiwan was this change in our China policy, a
                    change that was sprung on us by stealth and carried out by Nixon and Kissinger
                    with a degree of clumsiness toward Taiwan that contrasted with the exquisite
                    care they devoted to the concerns of the PRC. Our first news in Taipei was an
                    informal phone call from a desk officer in the State Department alerting us to
                    an important announcement about to be made by the White House. A few minutes
                    later we received a flash message with the text or essence of the president's
                    statement about Kissinger's trip and his own plan to visit China before May of
                    1972. Coming from the conservative, anti-communist leader of the United States
                    of America, this was indeed a big deal, and, along with most others, we had been
                    left entirely out of the loop. If I as a person who supported the change in our
                    policy viewed our behavior in this manner, you can imagine the effect on Walter
                    McConaughy, a conservative gentleman of the old school thoroughly entwined in
                    our moral crusade against communism.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>The historic announcement was made in July 1971 about a week after my arrival in
                    Taipei. Unaware of White House maneuvers, McConaughy had underestimated portents
                    of change. I, although expecting the administration to crack the China door
                    open, thought that it would approach the PRC cautiously and certainly give us
                    notice. We were both jolted by the news. The ambassador was outraged. He felt he
                    had been done in along with his friends in the Republic of China, allies of long
                    standing. Apart from petty feelings of annoyance about being deliberately cut
                    out of such an important process, I was mostly concerned by the speed and
                    abruptness of the change, fearing it could easily result in unintended
                    consequences. In essence, McConaughy was uncomfortable if not entirely opposed
                    to recognition of the PRC; if the PRC was to be recognized, he would insist on
                    maintaining diplomatic relations with Taiwan. I was sure Beijing would never
                    accept such an arrangement. Yet I had much sympathy for the population of Taiwan
                    and believed we could and should find a way to accommodate their basic
                    needs.</p>
                <p>Once we had overcome our astonishment and differing reactions to the news, the
                    ambassador and I turned to practical concerns. We knew the Kuomintang
                    authorities would be astounded that we had taken this action without any kind of
                    notification or consultation with them. Chiang Kai-shek had probably been
                    assuming the status quo would be everlasting; his son, Vice Premier Chiang
                    Ching-kuo and the operational ruler of Taiwan, may have been mentally prepared
                    for some change but surely would be shaken. Almost all people would be worried,
                    and many, including nationalistic party members, would be furious. At a minimum,
                    we would face the excruciating discomfort of trying to explain a policy about
                    which we were uninformed. We expected the leadership would probably keep
                    negative reactions under control, but we were not sure. I naturally remembered
                    the sacking of the embassy fourteen years earlier during my first tour in
                    Taipei, a nationalistic frenzy indulged by the authorities if not if not
                    actually stimulated by them. It was not a morale-booster to be back in the same
                    building, wondering how crowds might behave this time.</p>
                <p>Not having been prepared for a change of policy, either by their own government
                    or by us, ordinary citizens of Taiwan were obviously surprised and confused.
                    Most of them probably found it hard to believe that the U.S. would recognize the
                    PRC or withdraw recognition of Taiwan. They knew their island was the location
                    of important U.S. bases and manufacturing operations for big American companies.
                    No one welcomed the announcement, except a few members of the minority favoring
                    Taiwan independence. The huge majority of Taiwanese, including most independence
                    advocates, were more realistic. While happy to see the end of U.S. support for
                    Chiang's claim to the mainland, they worried that Taiwan would be dangerously
                    isolated. Quite uniformly, people of recent mainland extraction feared that the
                    U.S. change would undermine their status and growing prosperity.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>These popular views did not become immediately clear. In the first rash of
                    reactions in the press controlled by the regime there was a tone of “down with
                    the US, we have been betrayed,” but there were also comments from some sober
                    observers who analyzed the situation judiciously. The most worrisome noises came
                    from deliberations within the Kuomintang party structure where, for a day or
                    two, some quite senior people talked of violent actions against the US.</p>
                <p>We worried about demonstrations. In fact, the government must have shared our
                    concern, because shortly after the announcement they sizeably increased the
                    police presence around the chancery, the ambassador's residence and my house.
                    Lamp posts, walls, and other inviting places were plastered with anti-American
                    slogans - rather like the protest style of the communists in Beijing. Although
                    the situation was tense and worrisome, McConaughy and I felt the regime would
                    not allow matters to get out of hand. We warned our staff to be careful,
                    nevertheless. Fortunately, we were right. The leaders let their Kuomintang
                    colleagues blow off steam and then quelled radical talk; they called us in to
                    make strong remonstrances about our obligations as an ally, etc.; and then the
                    tensions eased. No violence was tolerated for seven years - until the final
                    outburst during Christopher's negotiations for our post-diplomatic relations in
                    1978.</p>
                <p>The process by which we in the embassy - as well as the leaders and people of
                    Taiwan - learned of what our government had in mind was shapeless and confusing,
                    surprisingly clumsy for men who prided themselves on their acute understanding.
                    Little advance thought had been given to the operational issues. Political
                    bromides, such as Nixon's assertion that “our action in seeking a new
                    relationship with the People's Republic of China will not be at the expense of
                    old friends,” were viewed with proper cynicism in Asia. Within a fairly short
                    period of time people in Taiwan suspected they were an annoying fragment
                    complicating the implementation of a grand American strategy devised in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>At the beginning stage, I did not feel so critical of our “planning,” and I never
                    wavered from my basic support of Nixon's intent. After months of unsuccessful
                    attempts to get meaningful infractions from Washington, however, I was really
                    disturbed and quite angry. The ambassador was less inhibited by lack of
                    instructions; he stuck his neck out in assuring Taiwan's leadership that we
                    would not be withdrawing our support of them. Washington's instructions were
                    minimal - primarily because the State Department and its East Asian Bureau knew
                    little more than we did about what our leaders really had in mind about time
                    tables and specific actions. In this atmosphere of basic ignorance, McConaughy
                    chose to emphasize the happy side, presenting the issue as a long term one,
                    unlikely to harm our ties to an old ally. Although I did my best to keep up
                    people's courage, I suggested with increasing frequency that it was only a
                    matter of time - within the foreseeable future - before we withdrew our military
                    forces from Taiwan and extended diplomatic recognition to the PRC.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>McConaughy's optimism was shaken in late 1971 when the U.S. effort to introduce a
                    dual representation formula into the UN failed and resulted in Taiwan's
                    expulsion from the organization, an event that stunned the people of Taiwan.
                    That year, the State Department had finally gotten White House approval to
                    propose an arrangement that would have given China's seat on the Security
                    Council and General Assembly to the PRC but preserved a place for Taiwan in the
                    Assembly. It was a scheme that I had promoted vigorously in earlier years.
                    Kissinger had opposed it in 1970 as unworkable but had relented in the new
                    atmosphere of 1971. Taiwan was bullied into submission. In retrospect, I am sure
                    Kissinger was right about his original prediction of a negative, zero-sum
                    reaction from the PRC. More to the point, he must have known the prospects for
                    success were minimal after his spectacular visit to Beijing in July. This caused
                    a huge shift in voting patterns among countries that had chaffed so long under
                    our old policy. The Chinese arranged a humiliating defeat for our position, and
                    Taiwan was out of the UN. This was lesson number one for them about the
                    implications of our new strategy.</p>
                <p>Lesson number two was the Shanghai Communique issued on February 28, 1972 at the
                    conclusion of President Nixon's visit to China. The key section read:The U.S.
                    side declared: The United States acknowledges that all Chinese on either side of
                    the Taiwan Strait maintain there is but one China and that Taiwan is part of
                    China. The United States does not challenge that position. It reaffirms its
                    interest in a peaceful settlement of the Taiwan question by the Chinese
                    themselves. With this prospect in mind, it affirms the ultimate objective of the
                    withdrawal of all U.S. forces and military installations from Taiwan. In the
                    meantime, it will progressively reduce its forces and military installations on
                    Taiwan as the tension in the area diminishes.</p>
                <p>Along with others, we learned in advance from the New York Times something of the
                    communique's content and the course of its evolution. We were not given a text
                    until just before its issuance, and our efforts by telegram, helpful visitors,
                    etc. to get some exegesis were unsuccessful. I was rather relieved by the
                    communique, because it clearly identified the issue of peaceful resolution and
                    suggested gradualism in the process of normalization. I took exception, however,
                    to the blatant falsehood of its assertion about “all Chinese on either side of
                    the Taiwan Strait” agreeing there was “but one China.” Our Kuomintang friends
                    couldn't contradict this clever manipulation of their pretense about sovereignty
                    over the mainland, but our Taiwanese friends - both moderates and extremists -
                    were outraged. Personally, I saw no reason why the U.S. could not have adopted
                    the Japanese or Canadian formula (i.e., “take note of” or “acknowledge” the
                    Chinese position) that was less offensive. Marshall Green tried to get this
                    language modified but didn't succeed. At the time, I thought the American
                    authors were ignorant of conditions in Taiwan, and my later experience working
                    with them convinced me that my deduction was correct.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>My criticism did not detract from my basic support of the Shanghai Communique,
                    and I did my best to use this one-and-only guide for the conduct of our
                    extremely delicate operations in Taiwan. Ambassador McConaughy, burned by the
                    July, 1971 announcement and the UN defeat, also took hope from a document that
                    did not announce an explicit timetable for normalization. The phrasing of the
                    communique was a work of art subject to different interpretations. I thought it
                    meant that we would eventually terminate diplomatic relations with Taiwan;
                    McConaughy didn't. Marshall Green, who was despatched along with John Holdridge
                    from the NSC to tell us what it meant, refused to settle our argument but he
                    noted the absence of any flat commitment to normalize. This encouraged
                    McConaughy. He could not conceive that his country would de-recognize an old
                    ally.</p>
                <p>Among all groups in Taiwan the communique was a hot topic for discussion. We were
                    subjected to lots of angry criticism, especially for the language I have
                    highlighted. Native Taiwanese were extemely critical of the text. They
                    questioned our right to set policy that would govern their lives. Some did not
                    agree with our basic premise; i.e. that Chinese on Taiwan wished to have one
                    nation. They were interested in independence, not one China, particularly one
                    run by Beijing. Along with almost everybody else on Taiwan, the independence
                    advocates worried about their future and the possibility of a cut-off of
                    military supplies. Mainlanders feared the collapse of their universe. Despite
                    vociferous criticism, I also detected a sense of relief in many quarters that
                    the United States had not said something even more radical.</p>
                <p>The third lesson for Taiwan was that the US military presence really was going to
                    be withdrawn. This was the most operational effect of the new policy.
                    Predominantly, our military base facilities and forces were in Taiwan to support
                    our war effort in Vietnam. The most important facility was CCK Airbase near
                    Taichung used for logistic purposes and refueling of aircraft such as B-52
                    bombers headed for Vietnam. Further south we had a Cold War strike base for F-4
                    aircraft along with a small complement of nuclear weapons. There were also other
                    facilities scattered around the island for a variety of purposes, including
                    rehabilitation of aircraft and tanks. Seventh Fleet ships made frequent use of
                    the port facilities in Chilung and Kaohsiung, and the Commander of the US Taiwan
                    Defense Command was a three star admiral. The arrangements struck me as serving
                    a useful purpose so long as the Vietnam war was going on. I should mention that
                    we also had a MAAG for military supplies and training purposes.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>Almost immediately after the July 1971 announcement and very actively after the
                    Shanghai Communique, we assumed in the embassy that we should prepare for the
                    phase out of our forces and certainly discourage our military from any thoughts
                    of expanding activities. I wasn't sure what would happen with the MAAG; I hoped
                    we could reach some agreement that would leave a military assistance component
                    on Taiwan. This was an uncomfortable prospect for McConaughy, but I don't recall
                    much resistance from him. Our military commanders, however, were on a quite
                    different wave length, particularly since Washington delayed so long in
                    providing us with so much as a sketch of a withdrawal plan. CINCPAC had little
                    appreciation of what was going on in Washington, and the Seventh Fleet and
                    Taiwan Defense Commanders had even less. They didn't want to think about
                    withdrawals; they even spoke of beefing up forces. The JCS in Washington, who
                    were closer to senior policy makers, had more than an inkling of what might
                    happen, but they were in no hurry to issue guidance until ordered by the
                    president.</p>
                <p>Feeling more strongly about this than the ambassador, I struggled to get
                    Washington to rein in our local military and introduce some realism about our
                    new policy. I failed, and we were left dangling in Taiwan. As a result we
                    sometimes had senior military personnel from the Pacific commands, including
                    CINCPAC himself, reassuring their Taiwan counterparts that all would be
                    well.</p>
                <p>To make matters worse, we asked a big favor of Taiwan. I am embarrassed not to
                    remember whether it preceded or followed our first notification on force
                    withdrawals, but the impact would have been equally confusing in policy terms.
                    When we reached our first fragile agreement with North Vietnam in 1972, we
                    suddenly realized we were short of aircraft to beef up the South Vietnamese Air
                    Force in the window of time before we would have to cease our own operations. We
                    needed about a hundred or so F-5A,B planes used by the South Vietnamese, and we
                    turned to Taiwan for help. Taiwan had plenty of these aircraft that were being
                    phased out in favor of new F-5Es to be co-produced with Northrop in Taiwan.</p>
                <p>After getting instructions from highest authority in Washington, McConaughy, the
                    Taiwan defense commander, and I promptly called on Vice Premier Chiang Ching-kuo
                    and the chairman of the Taiwan JCS. Not surprisingly, they agreed and were able
                    satisfy our needs quickly. In partial return for this, we guaranteed eventual
                    U.S. Government approval of the F-5E co-production agreement, an action that
                    might otherwise have been de-railed by the Shanghai Communique.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>Chiang obviously saw the longer term benefit of doing us this favor, and we were
                    pleased to have been able to accommodate Washington so rapidly. The net effect,
                    however, was politically confusing - on the Taiwan leadership, on our military
                    commanders, and on Ambassador McConaughy. To varying degrees, they were briefly
                    lulled into hoping our force withdrawals from Taiwan would be postponed
                    indefinitely. In fact, there was a modest build up of American forces in Taiwan
                    for a few months to reinforce our resumed bombing efforts against North Vietnam.
                    I remained sure, however, that we would have to give up our military structure
                    on Taiwan.</p>
                <p>In any event, it was not long before we had to tell Taiwan we were about to begin
                    staged withdrawal from the island. The ambassador and I made the initial
                    presentation of our plans to Chiang Ching-kuo who took the news glumly but
                    without great resistance. Over the next year or so we continued the process and
                    after Ambassador McConaughy left for Washington, first for consultations and
                    then retirement, I carried on alone. Our meetings with Chiang were not to seek
                    concurrence; we phrased our remarks in the most diplomatic terms possible, but
                    we had no intention of allowing Taiwan to interfere with our plans. As the
                    embassy's point man, I found this a very difficult task, far more delicate than
                    most. Boiled down to its essence, our message was as follows: to fulfill
                    President Nixon's commitment to your enemy in the Chinese civil war, we are
                    removing our military presence from your country. We know you are a long
                    standing ally of the United States, and we of course support the right of your
                    people to peace and security.</p>
                <p>Understandably Taiwan was very unhappy about what we were doing to them. In these
                    circumstances I was most impressed by Chiang's conduct, less so by his stubborn
                    subordinates. At one point, the Taiwan side deliberately leaked information in
                    violation of an explicit understanding not to do so. Partly to signify I was a
                    loyal US team member, I asked Washington to order me to see Chiang. I called on
                    him alone and, speaking in reasonably good Chinese, braced him with our strong
                    objection. Apart from this and a few other problems, Taiwan sensibly did not
                    give us a hard time over the withdrawals - probably less than our own
                    commanders. The process of notification was virtually complete by the time
                    Ambassador Unger took over, although the final withdrawals, the F-4s,
                    intelligence facilities, and headquarters structure, took place after I returned
                    to Washington in 1974.</p>
                <p>The most important issue for Taiwan, i.e., the ultimate significance of all that
                    was happening to the country, was not at all clear to anybody during my service
                    in Taipei. In what time frame would the U.S. normalize relations with the PRC?
                    What would be the effect on Taiwan's status? Would a U.S. presence remain on the
                    island? Would the defense commitment remain? Would Taiwan be able to procure
                    arms? etc. For understandable reasons Washington could not provide clear answers
                    to any of these questions, but it could have done much better in helping us cope
                    with Taiwan's trauma. It did not do so, I believe, largely because the White
                    House was playing its cards very close to its chest and did not trust the State
                    Department, which was unable to make a case on our behalf. Thus instead of a
                    consistent U.S. message, people in Taiwan were subjected to confusing voices
                    from Americans with different opinions.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>Looking back now, it is interesting that the closest thing to an answer about
                    Taiwan's future status came not from the US but from Japan. When Japan raced
                    ahead of us in 1972 to normalize relations with the PRC, they faced many of the
                    same problems that would complicate our negotiations. Although Japan's
                    arrangements for Taiwan were governed by their discussions with the PRC, they
                    also had to be acceptable to the Taiwan authorities. This led to a drawn out
                    negotiation in Taipei as well as Tokyo - with both help and interference from
                    the governing Liberal Democratic Party. The Japanese ambassador in Taipei, who
                    was a friend of many years, kept me well informed of this process, and I
                    reported it in great detail to Washington.</p>
                <p>At the time I got no reaction from Washington, although there was great interest
                    in the Japanese experience. Effectively, Japan cut off all official relations
                    with Taiwan, but preserved a wide range of unofficial relations by means of a
                    facade which was tolerable, if not entirely “acceptable” to the PRC. Granting
                    that the Japanese didn't have to cope with the security issue, their experience
                    was nevertheless very pertinent to what we might eventually do. Japan, the PRC,
                    and Taiwan were quite aware of this as they negotiated the details.</p>
                <p>In the absence of guidance on how to deal with these long range issues, our job
                    in Taipei amounted to damage control, and we went about it in different ways.
                    The ambassador never abandoned hope that we would maintain full diplomatic
                    relations with the Republic of China, and he was very sincere if somewhat
                    misleading in his repeated expressions of continuity of policy. Convinced this
                    was impossible, I plugged for maintaining as much of a relationship with Taiwan
                    as could be salvaged. Even after losing its UN membership and diplomatic status,
                    I thought Taiwan could survive as a national entity and prosper economically
                    very much as it has. My main concern was that the process of change be orderly
                    and systematic so as not to endanger Taiwan's political stabilityor security. In
                    these early days I had some embryonic views on how we should maintain
                    non-diplomatic relations and defense cooperation with Taiwan, but these did not
                    crystalize until I returned to Washington.</p>
                <p>Although McConaughy and I tried, when talking to the authorities and citizens of
                    Taiwan, to maintain a common line of “reassurance” about U.S. constancy toward
                    friends, our differing visions of the future were fairly apparent, and they were
                    exposed when we had visitors. We had lots of visitors with a wide range of
                    views: admirals who talked to us as though we would have perpetual military
                    access to Taiwan; senators and congressmen who told us they had been assured by
                    Nixon that the policy was just what had been publicly stated - no more, no less.
                    Our visitors spoke in the same vein to Taiwan parsonages. The overall impact of
                    visitor comments was to reduce the sense of alarm on Taiwan.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>Of course, we had a few visitors who told us in confidence that they expected
                    sharp departures from current policy, and over time they turned out to be
                    three-quarters right. My sense was that the future might be somewhat between the
                    extremes. In any event, I was desperate to know more about what was going on in
                    Washington. With the ambassador's approval, I wrote and phoned Marshall Green,
                    but I must say that my probing was not very successful. I then asked that I be
                    allowed to return to Washington for consultations, and my request was approved,
                    but not for quite a while, and the result was not very productive. Although
                    Marshall was slowly getting some grasp of the Taiwan issue, he was still being
                    kept at arms length by the White House. John Holdridge, my former boss, friend,
                    and colleague in the NSC, was sympathetic but unable to cut me in. I returned to
                    Taipei little better informed.</p>
                <p>Although the watershed Shanghai Communique provided us a kind of blueprint, it
                    was vague on key points and left most questions unanswered. What I hoped for was
                    an authoritative, two-sided massage from Washington. For Taiwan I wanted as much
                    reassurance as Nixon could give about protecting Taiwan's basic needs. For
                    ourselves, and especially our military representatives, I wanted forthright
                    guidance about force withdrawals. I have already explained that we didn't get
                    the latter until late in the game. On the former, however, President Nixon was
                    responsive, perhaps overly so, before his visit to China. I had the impression
                    he really wanted to maintain close relationships with Taiwan as long as he could
                    - unlike Kissinger who shunned the place. He had some respect for Chiang
                    Kai-shek, and he was willing to listen to the Walter McConaughys and Ronald
                    Reagans of the world. In response to McConaughy's request, he selected Ronald
                    Reagan, then Governor of California, as his personal representative to visit
                    Taiwan in the fall of 1971 to assure Chiang Kai-shek and the people that the
                    United States would behave responsibly.</p>
                <p>Reagan carried out his mission with zeal. We wrote his speech, blending the kind
                    of sentiments we knew he would want to express within the strictures of the
                    newly emerging policy, and limiting promises as much as we could. It was much
                    more the kind of speech I would have given, than the more positive and hopeful
                    version that McConaughy would have provided. Reagan dutifully delivered the
                    speech as we had written it, but in his answers to questions he spoke for
                    himself, sounding much more like McConaughy than Gleysteen and wandering way out
                    of line in talking about the future. The ambassador and Reagan hit it off very
                    well. Chiang Kai-shek was reassured, Chiang Ching-kuo may have been slightly
                    reassured, and the tame media loved it. Unfortunately, Reagan's answers were
                    misleading; he was speaking for himself, not Nixon and Kissinger. Some elements
                    of the bureaucracy, media, and commercial community understood this. They were
                    more sophisticated and understood the situation better that their bosses.
                    Anyway, we got more reassurance than I thought was wise!</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>The kind of easy reassurances offered by Reagan were undercut by the Shanghai
                    Communique a few months later. By this time, I had become more pushy in
                    expressing my own views, because I was convinced they were more in line with
                    administration policy. I assumed the U.S. would recognize the PRC relatively
                    soon, that Taiwan would survive and prosper, and that one way or another we
                    would help ensure Taiwan's security. With the ambassador and American colleagues
                    - civilian and military - I talked very frankly this way. After we had begun our
                    military withdrawals, I also became more and more frank with Taiwan citizens -
                    by this time with the full approval of a new ambassador. I tried to conduct
                    these conversations on an off-the-record basis, and I had little trouble doing
                    so, because the regime, with strong powers of censorship, didn't want my remarks
                    to become public. In discussions with high officials I was circumspect, but if
                    asked, I responded frankly. I had no occasion to talk about grand strategy with
                    Chiang Ching-kuo; if I had I would have probably pulled my punches without
                    offering false consolation about the future.</p>
                <p>By the time Unger arrived, the situation in Washington had stabilized. Through
                    informal channels and with the passage of time, we managed to get a better
                    understanding of what was going on. We became more active; I stuck my neck out
                    pretty far by end of my tour. I gave a number of background interviews to
                    editors in which I warned them that a change in the U.S.-Taiwan relationship was
                    bound to happen. I gave these interviews with Unger's blessing, and we reported
                    what I was doing to Washington. This was a painful process for both sides.
                    Although many persons did not want to hear my conclusions, I think I people in
                    Taiwan considered me “an honest man,” and I finally gained respect from the
                    regime when my predictions turned out to be right on the money. People probably
                    felt that McConaughy was “morally” right, but that Unger and I were more in step
                    with the times.</p>
                <p>The embassy's situation was unprecedented, at least in my experience. First and
                    most extraordinary, we were not consulted by our own leaders about a major
                    change of policy radically affecting our country assignment. Second, we were
                    given virtually no guidance about what to say to our host regime. Third, there
                    was a split in the embassy front office as to where policy was going - or should
                    be going. Obviously, all of this had a impact on the staff who were left with
                    many questions and few answers. Nevertheless, morale was good. As I have
                    mentioned, most of the staff saw East Asia more or less as I did. I think most
                    of them felt that our opening to the PRC was a very significant shift that was
                    bound to occur sooner or later. All, including two ambassadors, felt that it was
                    handled badly on the Taiwan end. There was no way major surgery could have been
                    painless, but with more care we might have been able to soften the hurt for our
                    friends in Taiwan.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>Nixon and Kissinger chose to circumvent the normal channels when they moved
                    almost overnight to change the direction of our foreign policy. I think they
                    paid inadequate attention to the effect of the new policy on Taiwan and the
                    nervousness that it created in Korea and other East Asian countries,
                    particularly Japan. I know their justification for being unorthodox, and I would
                    have a hard time arguing they should have relied more heavily on Secretary
                    Rogers. But at least they could have used Marshall Green, who was the
                    Department's stalwart in this process, and they could have assembled an inside
                    team at the NSC with some Taiwan competence. Fortunately, the Department came
                    back to life when Kissinger moved over to become the secretary of state.</p>
                <p>In Taiwan we were exposed to decisions one at a time, which made it difficult for
                    us conduct ourselves in ways that would cause the least possible damage in
                    Taiwan. We were very upset by these tactics and continually tried to find out
                    from Washington what might be coming next. For many reasons, this was not
                    possible during the early stages of normalization. Certainly the State
                    Department did not have the blue prints. I am not sure that Kissinger did
                    either. In his talks with the PRC after the Nixon visit he discussed possible
                    formulas for recognition as well as the timetable for force withdrawal from
                    Taiwan, and we now know that Nixon pledged to complete the process after the
                    election in 1976. Although Kissinger apparently assumed fairly rapid progress,
                    the process was, in fact, quite drawn out. Nixon's and Kissinger's hopes that
                    their new policy would induce the PRC to put heavy pressure on the Vietnamese
                    were disappointed. Dealing with Taiwan's future security proved more complicated
                    and more politically sensitive than anticipated. The failure in the UN came as
                    somewhat of a surprise; until things fell apart, we thought we could hold the
                    line in the UN for at least another year. Then came the final demands of the
                    Vietnam War followed by Nixon's resignation. Whatever neat plans may have
                    existed in leaders' minds, these events gave our Taiwan policy an ad hoc quality
                    it didn't deserve.</p>
                <p>Having been at the receiving end in Taipei, I developed a very active interest in
                    trying to protect Taiwan as much as possible within the constraints of the new
                    policy. Just as in my final months in Taipei, I insisted on calling a spade a
                    spade in my dealings with Taiwan representatives after I returned to Washington
                    to serve under Phil Habib. Moreover, I made a point of telling representatives
                    of the PRC that they didn't understand what was going on in Taiwan, and I tried
                    to explain to them what I saw as the important characteristics of the islands. I
                    was filled with missionary zeal on this subject.</p>
                <p>Enough about the effects of our new China policy. We didn't spend all of our time
                    taking things apart in Taiwan. In fact, the negative impact of the Nixon switch
                    coincided with the emergence of very positive trends within Taiwan, political as
                    well as economic. Since I have already touched on this elsewhere I can be
                    relatively brief.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>When I returned in 1971 for my second tour in Taipei, Taiwan was undergoing great
                    political change, not dramatically from a police state to a democracy as in
                    later years, but nevertheless significant. Although Chiang Kai-shek was still
                    alive, his almost exclusive focus on return to the mainland no longer governed
                    events. Both he and his preoccupations had virtually disappeared. The new focus
                    was on Taiwan's development. The economy was enjoying rapid growth thanks to
                    well managed export industries and extensive connections with the US and Japan.
                    The old socialist industrial sector was being privatized, and market forces were
                    being allowed to play a major role. Standards of living were rising rapidly.</p>
                <p>Most significant for the democratic pattern of today, Taiwan's new leadership
                    under President Chiang's son, Chiang Ching-kuo, was co-opting growing numbers of
                    the native Taiwanese community into the government, the Kuomintang, and the army
                    - even slowly into the senior officer corps. Police state controls were being
                    softened; political power was beginning to be shared; and Taiwan had become a
                    very egalitarian, educated, and socially mobile society.</p>
                <p>To be sure, there were more than a few ugly traces of the old regime. Mainlanders
                    still dominated the government and politics. Although oppositionists were
                    elected to the parliament and local governments, they were still barred from
                    organizing any political party outside the Kuomintang. Human rights abuses
                    against Taiwan independence activists and other dissidents were prevalent and
                    often ugly. The mainlander-native divide that I saw during earlier years was
                    still a dominant factor of public life, despite encouraging trends toward
                    accommodation on both sides. The government's implacable hostility toward the
                    PRC - and its periodic resort to para-military pinpricks against the communists
                    - remained, even if younger Taiwan citizens sought to learn more about the
                    mainland, some even wanting to travel there. Permission for cross-Strait
                    business and travel was still ten years away.</p>
                <p>Citing these traces of the past, some people, including Taiwanese opposition
                    leaders, independence advocates, and some of our missionaries, argued that the
                    regime was as ugly as ever. As in Park Chung Hee's Korea, they stirred up
                    support from sympathizers in the U.S. and Japan in hopes of stimulating foreign
                    intervention. Before I discuss this, I want to emphasize that these people were
                    surprisingly blind to the longer term significance of major changes,
                    particularly the leadership's gradual but real accommodation of the Taiwanese
                    majority throughout the society, the de facto military truce with the PRC, and
                    the evolution of a new value structure in urban areas as a result of market
                    driven growth and foreign exposure.</p>

                <p>Unlike the embassy under Rankin and Drumright, the embassy under McConaughy and
                    Unger deserves credit for understanding and being in the forefront of reporting
                    this evolution. Our political counselor, Burt Levin, a shrewd and colorful
                    “China-type,” had a firm grasp of it, including the way average people were
                    accommodating to the new vision. So did his successor, Harvey Feldman. I joined
                    Levin on some of his “take the pulse” trips, and I took advantage of my position
                    to cultivate the senior individuals around Chiang Ching-kuo who were
                    implementing this low key but major reform in Taiwan. I praised them and,
                    whenever appropriate, Chiang Ching-kuo himself for what they were doing. Given
                    his old time associations, McConaughy was less fascinated by this process than
                    I, but he let us react positively and convey the message to Washington. From my
                    INR days before going to Taipei I recall there was already some appreciation of
                    this evolution in Taiwan, and after I returned to the EA Bureau in 1974, I think
                    Embassy Taipei's view had become conventional wisdom in the Department.</p>
                <p>President Chiang Kai-shek and his son, Chiang Ching-kuo, were the symbols
                    straddling this profound change. As I have mentioned several times before, my
                    opinion of the father was less than favorable. I know he played some positive
                    role in China's modernization, but I saw him as a disappointing authoritarian
                    leader; by this time he was a spent force, completely out of touch with the
                    times. His public life was apparently controlled by his wife, who was always
                    with him, or by his secretaries. I was uncomfortable when Americans fawned over
                    him and probably gave him the wrong impression of his status in the U.S.. I
                    accompanied the ambassador on a few calls, once to talk about the impending
                    collapse of Taiwan's position in the UN. Usually, the reason for the visit was
                    taken care of quickly and the rest of time it was “memory lane.” McConaughy
                    liked this, and the two men got along very well. Despite my lack of esteem, I
                    did not have hostile feelings about Chiang Kai-shek.</p>
                <p>I had a very different view of Chiang Ching-kuo. My opinion of him went through
                    an evolution. I first considered him a junior version of his father. That
                    changed when I got to know him; eventually I had a very positive view. In fact,
                    historically speaking, I would list Chiang Ching-kuo as one of China's more
                    impressive leaders - even compared to the mainland competition. During my second
                    tour he was first deputy premier and then premier before becoming president
                    after his father's death. These were promotions without a distinction; he did
                    the same work in all these capacities. He was effectively in charge of the
                    regime and the country for many years.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>Chiang the younger was Taiwan oriented. He visited all parts of the islands to
                    see for himself how people lived. He wanted native Taiwanese to support the
                    regime. He was a smart, moderate man who tried his best to live down his own and
                    his family's checkered past. Although he was very down to earth, Chiang
                    Ching-kuo had a concept and vision about what was needed in Taiwan; i.e. a
                    prosperous, well educated, egalitarian society embracing native born as well as
                    immigrant citizens and depending on strong military forces and international
                    engagement for protection. I often heard him talk this way, but I don't really
                    know how his vision extended to China proper. In his youth he was sent by his
                    father to be educated in the Soviet Union. He denied ever having been a
                    communist, but clearly the experience left him more concerned than his father
                    about the fate of common man. For a leader who had traveled so little to the
                    West, he was quite well informed about the world.</p>
                <p>For all the improvements over his father, Chiang Ching-kuo was also
                    authoritarian, very tough, and solidly anti-communist. He maintained firm
                    control over the military establishment and intelligence community - undoubtedly
                    responsible for some of the activity we opposed. He could be quite brutal, as a
                    number of people who crossed him found out. Nevertheless, I admired him for his
                    intellectual growth and for what he did for Taiwan. I don't know if Taiwan could
                    have survived without Chiang Ching-kuo or someone like him.</p>
                <p>I had a good relationship with him, although it was not nearly as close as, for
                    example, Ray Cline's, the CIA station chief during my first tour in Taiwan. Ray
                    became known as the “American ambassador” regardless of who actually filled that
                    chair. He was perceived - to some extent correctly - as running the show. None
                    of his successors had the same entree or power even though they all lived in the
                    “Pink House” reserved for station chiefs. Ambassador Drumright allowed Ray to do
                    his “own thing.” He traveled with Chiang Ching-kuo and became a kind of foreign
                    confidant. In those days we were still using Taiwan as a base for many
                    anti-communist operations. Cline's role was useful for this purpose, but he
                    should never have been allowed to appropriate such an important role. In any
                    event, my contacts with Chiang Ching-kuo were more innocent. Many of them were
                    in the company of the ambassador. Occasionally, I would escort visitors to see
                    Chiang. I dined with him many times, and I did see him privately on rare
                    occasions.</p>
                <p>I remember one such time when Speaker of the HousMcCormick came with a “small”
                    delegation of 16-20 representatives plus wives. I was charge' at the time, and I
                    invited the huge group to my house. I also invited Premier Chiang Ching-kuo, who
                    got the time wrong and arrived a half hour early. Alerted by our security
                    officer, I rushed home to greet him, and the two of us had a completely private
                    conversation about many things including policy matters until the throng
                    arrived. Chiang's willingness to come to my place, combined with our private
                    conversation, didn't harm my standing in Taiwan officialdom. I must say this was
                    a remarkable experience for me; I found that I could talk with him informally
                    and comfortably about very delicate issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>Despite Chiang Ching-kuo's relatively enlightened rule and the changes he was
                    nurturing, Taiwan was still enough of a bad boy in the period 1971-74 to be
                    singled out quite often for American punishment. With little public notice, we
                    complained, sometimes very sharply, to the authorities about human rights
                    violations, censorship, harassment of opposition forces, and so on. This was
                    usually done by the political section although occasionally by the ambassador or
                    me. Opposition elements, who knew we did this, appreciated it and often made a
                    show of their relations with us in hopes it would provide a protective screen
                    against the authorities.</p>
                <p>During this period we also vigorously discouraged lingering tendencies in Taiwan
                    to conduct para-military and intelligence adventures against the PRC, especially
                    cloak and dagger operations mounted from Hong Kong, which I will touch on later.
                    In the same vein we detected and began strenuous efforts to stop a clandestine
                    nuclear weapons program. We came across intelligence and other evidence that the
                    regime was diverting substantial resources into development of nuclear weapons.
                    We had a difficult time verifying this, initially treating it as probable but
                    not conclusive. Over past years we had cooperated extensively with Taiwan in
                    peaceful uses of nuclear energy. We had helped with the construction of several
                    nuclear power plants. Our Atomic Energy Commission had good rapport with Taiwan
                    scientists, had provided assistance in improving Taiwan's scientific base, and
                    was familiar with Taiwan's nuclear labs. So we first looked to the AEC for
                    information about what the regime was really doing. They were not very
                    useful.</p>
                <p>A senior AEC representative came out to help us. For some time we had been trying
                    to pry our way into the nuclear lab at the Chung Shan Institute where we were
                    fairly certain Taiwan was reprocessing fuel to extract plutonium. Having been
                    given a run around by the authorities, we finally succeeded in getting access.
                    When the Washington visitor, the embassy's Science Attache, and I inspected
                    Chung Shan we were told flatly that the labs there were not used for
                    reprocessing and that Taiwan had never been engaged in the process. Our AEC man
                    saw clear evidence, however, of lab design for that purpose, and we later
                    discovered they had temporarily dismantled part of the facility to hide their
                    operations. These observations at Chung Shan, combined with increasingly
                    convincing intelligence, led us to make a strong demarche, demanding that all
                    nuclear facilities in Taiwan for reprocessing or other military uses be closed
                    down. That was done - more or less, for a while.</p>
                <p>An ironic footnote. On a subsequent visit, this same AEC representative told me
                    that he had been approached by his Taiwan counterparts to ask that we “loan”
                    Taiwan a small amount of plutonium for peaceful research purposes in their labs.
                    I was astounded that Taiwan could be so brazen, even more by our man who said he
                    was inclined to oblige them. Washington quickly helped us snuff out this little
                    ploy.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>My view on leaving Taipei was that the nuclear genie had been put back in the
                    bottle, or at least had not been allowed to get further out of the bottle.
                    However, a few years after I returned to Washington, the issue again became
                    acute; we found more incontrovertible evidence of Taiwan's experimentation with
                    nuclear weapons production - somewhat akin to our problems with South Korea -
                    and we had to make an extraordinarily strong demarche to stop it. This Taiwan
                    experience sensitized me to the Korean scene. I was a strong supporter of the
                    tough actions we took in both countries.</p>
                <p>I would like to conclude with a few more comments about the embassy and the
                    effects of the new China policy on its relations with other U.S. organizations
                    in Taipei. The issue of our force withdrawals from Taiwan created tension
                    between the embassy and the Taiwan defense command. The commanding admiral, a
                    submariner, while being a basically good man, was not skilled in the diplomatic
                    game and lacked sympathy for the direction in which we were moving. Since his
                    guidance from Washington and from CINCPAC was sometimes at cross purposes with
                    Nixon's new policy, we worked out stringent new rules of conduct for all of our
                    military forces to minimize potential misunderstandings. In the early stages,
                    the admiral wasn't very cooperative: we were trying to lower our military
                    profile on Taiwan; he was trying to keep it high. Under McConaughy, who was cozy
                    with admirals, it was hard to keep the commander down.</p>
                <p>Under Unger it was easier both because of his views and the fact that he was
                    under pressure from Washington to ensure firm control over all elements of the
                    country team. Our policy had also become more clear. Shortly after Unger arrived
                    I had a big fight with the admiral who wanted to talk to the ambassador rather
                    than me to try and get around the rules. Since I was the designated contact for
                    the U.S. military, I didn't let him, and we argued back and forth angrily for a
                    long time. He accused the embassy of pandering to the PRC against the interests
                    of our hosts in Taiwan; I warned him that if he kept on giving us a hard time,
                    we would have no trouble getting Washington to order him to behave, or words to
                    that effect. This sobered him down. Unger backed me fully. The admiral's
                    behavior improved markedly.</p>
                <p>The admiral was not always present at our high level meetings concerning the
                    military draw-downs. He was, however, very much in the picture when we
                    negotiated the transfer of Taiwanese F-5A and Bs to South Vietnam, and was most
                    helpful. Of course, after each meeting that the admiral didn't attend, we would
                    give him a complete read-out. There was no personal animosity between the
                    embassy and the US command; they were very good to us. But most U.S. military
                    officers understandably thought they were defending a close relationship with an
                    ally and anything that smacked of a departure from this bothered them. It was a
                    real shock for them when we changed directions.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>I should say that in general I had very good relations with the U.S. military in
                    Taiwan. I went out of my way to be helpful to them. But sometimes on specific
                    issues, such as the one I just mentioned, I had to be, and was, quite tough. I
                    also had a pretty good relationship with the senior officers of the Taiwan
                    military, including the JCS. I saw a lot of them, mostly in social settings.
                    They knew we had fairly ready access to their boss, Chiang Ching-Kuo; some of
                    them sometimes attended our sessions with him. They always invited us to their
                    parties; we periodically reciprocated.</p>
                <p>The station chief during my DCM tour was Daren Flitcroft. The deputy was Bob
                    Grealy. By this time, the station had only residual contacts with the kind of
                    people who had been powerhouses in Cline's days. Because of our cooperation over
                    many years, they knew the intelligence community well, including presumably some
                    of the operatives working against the PRC. But our policy had changed since
                    Cline's days - even before Nixon's opening to the PRC; the change probably
                    started in the Kennedy administration. We stopped talk about their return to the
                    mainland, and we tried to stop them from using violent tactics - poisoned pens,
                    bomb throwing, etc. This new position may have gotten blurred sometimes because
                    of longstanding close personal relationships between our people and the
                    perpetrators of such activities.</p>
                <p>McConaughy had a good formal relationship with the Station Chief, but he insisted
                    that his DCM manage the relationship between the Station and the rest of the
                    Embassy. That left me the main job of liaison with the Station, even though the
                    Chief participated in country team meetings. I discussed this aspect of the job
                    with the Ambassador soon after my arrival; I accepted the role willingly because
                    I thought it was important that the front office know what the CIA was doing; I
                    am not sure what my predecessors had done in this regard, but I thought it newly
                    important since there had been a number of embarrassing incidents, particularly
                    in South East Asia, caused by the failure of embassies to exercise firm
                    supervision over stations. Although he obviously agreed that intelligence
                    activities must conform with U.S. policy, McConaughy didn't want to play the
                    supervisory role directly himself, but he pledged he would support me in case of
                    differences with the station.</p>
                <p>In fact, that commitment was not really necessary, since both the station chief
                    and his deputy were exceptionally cooperative. As I said, the station had a lot
                    of embarrassing entanglements from the past from which we wanted to distance
                    ourselves. I soon became well versed in intelligence matters, although perhaps
                    not as well as I became later in Korea. With Unger's arrival I remained involved
                    in this process, but the ambassador resumed a more traditional, direct role in
                    supervision of all agencies.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>I think I was comfortable with the activities of other agencies-USIA, MAAG, etc.
                    I kept a close eye on USIA; I had troubles with the MAAG chief who, although
                    under a military chain of command, was also subject to the ambassador's guidance
                    for most of his work. I think we had three MAAG chiefs during my tour. The first
                    was a very difficult person, a gung ho army major general who was always on the
                    borderline of inappropriate behavior. As I recall, we eased him out before his
                    tour was scheduled to end. His replacement ran afoul of military discipline for
                    financial irregularities. He also had to be removed. Finally, we got a MAAG
                    chief who did a fine job. McConaughy really hated to fire anybody; he was
                    particularly anxious to keep good relationships with all the senior staff and
                    considered the MAAG general “one of his boys.” My recommendation caused him some
                    pain, but he approved, nevertheless.</p>
                <p>Our economic assistance program had been terminated a few years earlier, so that
                    was no longer a factor in the management of the embassy. DEA, as I recall, gave
                    us some problems; it was very new and very aggressive. Its prime focus was the
                    trans-shipment of drugs from Southeast Asia to the States, and Taiwan's airports
                    were a central part of the air network. There was quite a bit of drug
                    trafficking through our military bases; drugs would be brought in by soldiers or
                    their wives. We tried to be as helpful as we could to the DEA staff, and we had
                    some drug trafficking experts on our own staff. DEA frequently ignored the fact
                    that Taiwan was foreign territory and that they were required to operate with
                    Taiwan's approval. They would sometimes appear unannounced at a civilian airport
                    and make an arrest. They exceeded their jurisdiction and created unnecessary and
                    embarrassing work for us when we had to apologize, usually at my level.</p>
                <p>Our local drug problem was centered in our military forces. We frequently had
                    airmen who got into trouble with Taiwan's strict rules against drug possession,
                    mostly for marijuana, but sometimes, more dangerous narcotics. Taiwan also
                    hosted many families of both military and CIA personnel assigned to Vietnam.
                    Quite a few of them were involved in drugs, and we had a substantial drug
                    problem in the American schools.</p>
                <p>The Taiwan defense commander was responsible for the military schools, and the
                    embassy for the civilian school. We worked together closely. I got the nickname
                    of “Mayor” for my supervision of the schools on behalf of the ambassador. On two
                    occasions, the admiral and I called all the American families together and
                    really laid down the law with the support of the ambassador, who also attended.
                    It was a gathering of thousands. When serious violators came to our attention,
                    we took quick, decisive action - we sent the family home. Those draconian
                    measures helped reduce drug usage among Americans, including our own foreign
                    service families, to manageable levels.</p>
                <p>Embassy Taipei was fairly large - not as large as Embassy Seoul - but
                    substantial. If all agencies, except the military commands were included, we had
                    a lot of Americans and Chinese working for the U.S. government in Taiwan.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>I mentioned at the beginning that McConaughy was very generous in his treatment
                    of me. Had I been in McConaughy's place as ambassador, I don't believe I would
                    allowed my DCM such a free hand. The relationship is a tricky one. I don't
                    believe a DCM should march in lockstep with his or her boss. A reasonable
                    difference of views is acceptable, and probably a good thing. Some constructive
                    tension in the front office can be helpful; it may on occasion encourage one or
                    the other officer to challenge conventional wisdom, whereas an overly compliant
                    DCM can inhibit healthy argument and even invite danger in some situations. A
                    rebellious DCM is almost sure to be destructive. The difficult question is where
                    to draw the line between useful and destructive.</p>
                <p>I think the situation in Embassy Taipei fell somewhere between the two. On the
                    one hand, it was quite apparent to the host country that there was a significant
                    difference of opinion in the embassy's front office. Both McConaughy and I tried
                    to be circumspect about our differences, but acute observers could have detected
                    them. I was never aware of any opportunity or effort by Taiwan to exploit the
                    situation; nor was Washington concerned about it. It might have been different
                    if I, the DCM, had been off base in terms of policy rather than a distinguished
                    ambassador.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, I think it was useful that I - or someone with my views - was in
                    Taiwan while our PRC policy was undergoing a major shift. With a DCM who fully
                    agreed with McConaughy, our government would have had a very difficult time
                    getting the ship to steer in the right direction. There might have been serious
                    consequences for Taiwan because the embassy might have delivered the wrong
                    message at critical times. This entire problem melted away under Ambassador
                    Unger. I think he and I had a rather ideal relationship. We had very different
                    backgrounds and some differences, but they posed hardly any problem for our
                    cooperation.</p>
                <p>I should not leave this issue without also saying that I really liked McConaughy.
                    After his retirement, I used to visit him. My articulation of my views was
                    always known to him. I didn't go behind his back. It is the ambassador's role to
                    set the views of an embassy, not the DCM's. It is best if the ambassador and a
                    DCM broadly agree on the nature of our national interests in the host country as
                    well as on the basic objectives to be pursued. Although McConaughy and I
                    differed on the merits of recognizing the PRC, he gave me full credit for trying
                    to keep our relations with Taiwan as close as we could. I think my views
                    represented the majority of the embassy staff, even if I was more outspoken.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>I want to add a footnote about something that severely embarrassed me while I was
                    in Taiwan. Provoked by the war in Vietnam, some rogue official in our government
                    provided hundreds of classified telegrams to a journalist, Walter Winchells'
                    successor, I believe, who began to print them one by one in his columns. Some of
                    them happened to be from Embassy Taipei, and apart from the shocking degree of
                    irresponsibility involved by both men, I don't think great harm was done.
                    However, one telegram was a message I had sent Marshall Green asking for his
                    help in getting special permission for Taiwan's Foreign Minister Chou Shu-kai to
                    visit Washington at a time we were trying to lower Taiwan's profile in our
                    country. To support Chou's cause I had adopted a rather patronizing tone about
                    his being one of the good guys in Taiwan, and I had been successful in getting
                    him the visa. When the whole damn message was printed in the Washington Post,
                    however, I was shocked and acutely embarrassed. Washington was never able or
                    willing to explain how this had occurred, and I was forced to go and apologize
                    in person about our inability to secrets.</p>
                <p>Q: In 1974, you were appointed as deputy assistant secretary in the Bureau of
                    East Asian and Pacific Affairs (EAP). Who was the assistant secretary and how
                    was the appointment made?</p>
                <p>GLEYSTEEN: The assistant secretary was Phil Habib, and he wrote to me asking
                    whether I would be interested in the job. It came as a surprise, but I jumped at
                    the chance. Despite being the most junior deputy to Habib, I inherited Art
                    Hummel's China responsibilities and retained them throughout my Washington tour.
                    My other duties varied from time to time, depending on the strengths and
                    seniority of other incoming deputy assistant secretaries. For example, when Owen
                    Zurhellen joined us for about a year as the senior deputy, he was given the
                    Japan and Korea portfolios. When he left, they were re-assigned to me. At
                    various times, I also had responsibility for the Philippines, Australia, New
                    Zealand, Southeast Asia (but not Indochina) and the Pacific island areas. For a
                    period I also supervised the Office for Regional Affairs. Throughout this period
                    Bob Miller had normal responsibility for Southeast Asia - overwhelmingly the
                    problems of Vietnam that were so vexing for Habib in those years. Economic
                    issues were the province of our colleague, Les Edmonds.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>I first met Habib in the early 1960s while I was in Tokyo and he was political
                    counselor in Seoul. I kept up with him after he was assigned to Vietnam. We had
                    a friendly relationship and enjoyed arguing with each other. While I respected
                    him as a highly competent, extremely effective bureaucrat, I often disagreed
                    with the strategy and tactics he was defending in Vietnam. I remember visiting
                    him in Saigon in the 1960s; he was considerably overweight, consuming heavy
                    amounts of wine. Yet he kept a pace that few could match. He was all over the
                    place and on the go every minute of the day. He was quite brilliant in his
                    performance. One had to wonder, however, how long he could carry such a
                    workload, and in fact, it helped precipitate his first serious medical problem.
                    Later, I admired Habib for biting the bullet on negotiations with North Vietnam,
                    something he had so strongly opposed in earlier days. He played a powerful role
                    in Clark Clifford's study for President Johnson, and then threw himself heart
                    and soul into the Paris peace negotiations. He was ruthlessly honest in the
                    process and willing to speak the unspeakable. When I joined his staff in
                    Washington several years later, Vietnam was a most depressing issue. We were
                    already on the final downward slide.</p>
                <p>Vietnam did not prevent Phil from working on other issues. He was thoroughly
                    engaged in China policy, which was so dear to Kissinger's heart. Although he
                    looked to others for expertise, Phil had strong opinions about how to manage
                    discussion in the American camp. I could always see him about China, Japan or
                    any other problems that were arising in my area. He shared my sense of Japan's
                    importance and paid steady attention to Korea. All his deputies, including
                    junior me, were given more than the minimum time we needed with him.</p>
                <p>Working for Habib, I learned what the term “political animal” meant. He operated
                    within the bureaucracy as a politician would among his or her constituents. He
                    felt it necessary - and liked - to make contacts with political leaders - quite
                    like my subsequent boss Holbrooke who has similar instincts. I felt that these
                    connections were sometimes overdone, but I admired Habib for his skills in the
                    political arena. I tried my best to learn the game, even though sometimes I had
                    to force myself to do it. Sensing trouble in Congress, Phil would instinctively
                    seek to blunt any possible confrontation. He was known to be sincere,
                    argumentative, and persistent - such a vigorous talker that it was hard for
                    anybody else to get a word in. I couldn't mount such an attack, but I did learn
                    that one has to be aggressive in dealing with Congress - i.e. pushing hard to
                    see people, forcing them to listen to administration views, muting one's own
                    reservations about administration policy, etc. There was no substitute for this
                    Congressional combat so often poorly performed by members of the foreign
                    service.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>Let me turn to China. Like others I was fascinated by our new China connection,
                    even more so perhaps because of my boyhood and foreign service experience. I
                    wanted to act in Kissinger's China play, and I wanted to make use of my
                    considerable expertise on the PRC and Taiwan. Getting into the play was easy,
                    because my predecessor, Art Hummel, had earned Kissinger's respect, and Habib
                    helped get me into the act as his apprentice. Contributing my expertise was more
                    of a struggle, but fairly successful over time. In one of my first sessions in
                    Kissinger's presence, Habib said he thought I had important things to say about
                    Deng Xiaoping, and I was invited to explain why I thought Deng was not only a
                    worthy successor to Zhou Enlai but probably considerably more important.
                    Kissinger was skeptical; I stuck to my view, and after a year or so he more or
                    less acknowledged I might be right. But whether the process of education was
                    written or oral, it was always frustrating. Kissinger and his inner squad had
                    been in the new China play from the beginning. They had a kind of conceit, and
                    they were not eager to hear from others. Certainly, they did not want help in
                    writing the play. Thanks to Habib's steady cover for me, I sensed that I was
                    eventually accepted by Kissinger as a useful member of the bureaucracy to work
                    with his inner circle. However, I was never part of that circle.</p>
                <p>Despite my reservations about the way we had handled Taiwan, I felt our new
                    relationship with the PRC was a radical improvement over the past policy of
                    all-out confrontation. The change was demonstrably helpful to us in the conduct
                    of our foreign policy, both internationally and to some extent domestically.
                    Nevertheless, by the time I began working for Habib, we had reached a point of
                    stalemate in our efforts to complete the process of full normalization of
                    relations with China. The obstacle was Taiwan. In discussions with the Chinese
                    we had not yet come to grips with this nitty gritty problem, largely because of
                    substantial forces of domestic resistance reflected in Congress. This was the
                    situation when I started in 1974 and it remained without substantial change
                    until after the 1976 elections. Even so, great amounts of time and effort were
                    devoted to China. We tried hard to find ways of signifying progress that would
                    benefit our dealings with the rest of the world, especially the Soviets, and
                    sustain the domestic credit earned by Nixon's daring move. High level visits to
                    China were continued with much public fanfare, and large numbers of other
                    Americans began treks to the land of cultural revolution. Internally, we spent
                    much time and imagination preparing for and conducting this activity. It didn't
                    lead to a breakthrough but it laid the ground work for the next
                    administration.</p>
                <p>Although Kissinger rarely shared his inner thoughts with persons such as me, I
                    was quite involved in most aspects of our dealings with the PRC. Habib used me
                    as his additional eyes and ears. He wanted me to keep him abreast of what was
                    going on, and he passed on what he learned from on high. When crunch time would
                    come, he got more directly involved, often saturating himself in the problem. I
                    think it was a good technique. He normally took me along for discussions he had
                    with Kissinger on China, even those that were quite small. Similarly, he made
                    sure I went along on all the trips that Kissinger took to China. I was one of
                    the “China experts” who might be required.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>The most important issue consuming us during this period was how to sustain
                    momentum toward normalization. Although I had been quite unhappy in Taiwan about
                    what seemed like careless planning in Washington, I committed myself fully to
                    the cause of normalization after I got back to our capital city. I really
                    thought it could be accomplished without undermining the security of Taiwan, and
                    if it couldn't, I was convinced the effort would still benefit us. I never
                    doubted Kissinger wanted to complete the process of normalization. He had a
                    transparent commitment to the PRC to finish the process, as did President Nixon
                    who had been forced to leave the political scene. Ford, however, did not have
                    the same emotional allegiance to our PRC policy. In contrast to Nixon's almost
                    brazen reordering of the national agenda, Ford was more orthodox, worrying about
                    the potential domestic repercussions of normalization just before going to the
                    voters in 1976. In any event, I, along with others, annoyed Kissinger by
                    pressing him (usually via Habib but sometimes directly) to push all the way to
                    normalization. He didn't appreciate having puppies yap at his heels and told us
                    to keep in mind the complexity of decisions faced by the president.Coping with
                    Taiwan was another of my main responsibilities. In our dealings with the PRC
                    during this two year period we fenced around the Taiwan issue - a fair amount of
                    talking but no major effort to break the stalemate. As he had with Zhou and Mao
                    in 1972 and 1973, Secretary Kissinger raised the issue with Deng Xiaoping during
                    his trips to Beijing in both 1974 and 1975, emphasizing it was a problem within
                    our body politic that had to be resolved. He described the concerns of Taiwan's
                    defenders in Washington and stressed our government's need to take account of
                    their opinion if we were to have the degree of consensus necessary for a
                    successful normalization of relations with the PRC. Although I may be doing him
                    an injustice, I never felt that Kissinger manifested much personal conviction
                    that Taiwan's survival was in our national interest. He talked dispassionately
                    from a Washington vantage point about the political strength of those who
                    identified themselves with Taiwan.</p>
                <p>In the first session I attended in 1974 Kissinger probed for Deng's reactions to
                    a variation on the Japan formula; i.e., we would recognize the PRC as the sole
                    government of China and withdraw completely from Taiwan in a military sense, but
                    to ensure domestic support we would need to have a liaison mission in Taiwan and
                    we would also want some assurance about Taiwan's security pending peaceful
                    unification. The implied or stated premises were that all treaty relations with
                    Taiwan would be terminated, people to people relations would continue, while
                    Taiwan would be able to purchase defensive arms until the unification issue was
                    peacefully resolved within the extended period mentioned by Mao Zedong.
                    Kissinger always appealed for Chinese statesmanship and patience in dealing with
                    this problem of history. No comprehensive model of a proposed solution was ever
                    tabled, which was probably wise in the absence of presidential resolve to reach
                    a solution.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>In response, Deng pointed out that the principle of China's sovereignty,
                    enshrined in the Shanghai Communique, could not be compromised by any continuing
                    official or unofficial U.S. government relationship with Taiwan. Like Mao and
                    Zhou in earlier meetings he specifically rejected any U.S. continuing role in
                    the defense of Taiwan, even commercial provision of arms. He always added that
                    we “owed China a debt,” presumably for our failure to deliver on Nixon's pledge
                    to normalize relations and to compensate China for enhanced risks in its
                    confrontation of the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>While we remained deadlocked with the PRC about the next step of normalization,
                    we proceeded to prepare for it rather systematically within the government.
                    Force withdrawals from bases in Taiwan proceeded on the phased schedule that had
                    been established while I was still in Taiwan. I supervised a careful study,
                    lasting into the Carter Administration, on what Taiwan would need to maintain a
                    “credible” defense effort. We not only surveyed Taiwan's requirements but also
                    identified weapons and equipment that we should and should not supply. With
                    little guidance but clear approval from my superiors, I worked hard to strip
                    away all unessential functions from our civilian and military establishments in
                    Taiwan. Very importantly, I kept the Taiwan authorities informed of our
                    adjusting policy and cautioned them that I was virtually certain we would be
                    switching recognition within the foreseeable future. My main interlocutor was
                    the ROC ambassador, James Shen. I became the senior liaison for the Taiwan
                    Embassy; by this time Kissinger refused all contact with Taiwan officials, and
                    none of my other seniors, including Habib, wanted to hold Taiwan's hand.</p>
                <p>Mostly through lunch meetings, I told Shen that official activity would become
                    more and more difficult for Taiwan. I tried to paint as realistic a picture as I
                    could, always asking him to convey my views to Taipei. Once - in 1976, he
                    managed to break though our fence and called on Deputy Secretary Ingersoll for
                    the undeclared purpose of requesting agrement for his successor. Taiwan knew
                    that the future of its embassy in Washington was in doubt. Shen was said to be
                    ailing, and they wanted to put a new ambassador in place before it might be too
                    late. We had no forewarning of this move and were caught by surprise. Ingersoll
                    was non-plussed by the request and looked to me for signals. After flash
                    thinking, I blurted out something along the line: “Mr. Ambassador, you can't do
                    that. We can't agree with your request. You will have to plan on staying here
                    for a while.” Ingersoll, following my lead, went on to emphasize the need for
                    realism by Taiwan.</p>
                <p>Our answer was very painful for Shen and somewhat insulting to his government,
                    but a shift of Taiwan ambassadors at that point would have caused a real rumpus
                    with the PRC. I was certain Kissinger wouldn't accept a new ambassador from
                    Taiwan, so leaving Shen in place was the best tactic. In this zero-sum game, my
                    attentiveness to PRC sensitivities didn't help my relations with the ROC. After
                    the Ingersoll meeting, I talked to Shen and others, apologizing for a response
                    that I knew was painful for them. In fact, however, Taiwan was a bit too clever.
                    They should have tested the water before trying such a bold ploy, conceivably
                    designed by one of their American lobbyists. In any event, Taiwan left Shen in
                    Washington until the bitter end.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>I want to touch on a few other aspects of our China activities. A very important
                    feature of our high level contacts with Chinese leaders was to use the warmth of
                    this relationship as a lever in our dealings with the USSR. We engaged the PRC
                    in a broad range of well advertised discussions. We met frequently at
                    Kissinger's level and once at the summit. There were other high profile sessions
                    with the Chinese, for example, at the UN where I believe Kissinger first met
                    Deng. These sessions were long, comprehensive, and remarkably candid in
                    appearance. I sat through hours and hours of conversation, fortunately, not as
                    the note taker. I had an advantage since I was one of two of us who spoke
                    Chinese.</p>
                <p>Although I thought the implicit consequences of our China connection were a
                    useful factor vis a vis the Russians, I felt the overt manipulation of the
                    triangle was overdone. I didn't like the cloyingly friendly, almost worshipful
                    quality of some of our behavior toward the Chinese leaders, especially Mao,
                    Zhou, and to some extent Deng. I could forgive some of this as an understandable
                    pleasure to discover that Chinese Communists weren't so bad after all, and I
                    could indulge a bit of it to keep the Soviets on edge. But I often reacted badly
                    to the display. I thought it denigrated America's importance, and it ground
                    against my conviction that the Chinese needed us as much as we needed them. It
                    really pained me to hear Kissinger describing our policy of containment/detente
                    with the USSR as a combination necessary to satisfy the softies in our own
                    society and among our NATO allies. I did not like his habit of letting the
                    Chinese keep the high ground of inviolable principles or not being rebutted when
                    they spoke of our owing them a debt. I would have liked to hear a more robust
                    defense of our policy, calling a spade a spade and noting our differences and
                    common interests with both China and Russia. It would have worked just as well
                    if not better, and we Americans would have felt better. Although I made these
                    points to Habib and people in Kissinger's inner circle, I never had the
                    opportunity or guts to tell him myself.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>Another area where I sometimes parted company with Kissinger was military
                    cooperation with the PRC. On the basis of long experience, I felt instinctively
                    that as competitors for hegemony in Asia we were destined to have serious
                    differences with China, even while trying to maintain the best relationship
                    possible. I didn't oppose some military and intelligence activities with the
                    PRC, but I was generally wary of measures that would militarily strengthen
                    China. I was thinking of the effect on our East Asian allies, on a newly
                    isolated Taiwan, and ultimately on our own armed forces. This applied not only
                    to weapons but also to dual use technology such as advanced computers. The first
                    time I really choked over this issue was on learning that Kissinger had given
                    the British a green light to sell Spey engines (British built engines used in
                    the F-4) to the Chinese to jazz up one of their fighter/bombers. I argued that
                    this wouldn't sit well with the Koreans, Japanese, and certainly not with the
                    Taiwanese. And it didn't. When the Japanese found out they were furious,
                    particularly military officers. Computers were also controversial. In one long
                    debated case I was the only semi-senior official to have objected, but I did
                    object, and in writing. Subsequent history does not make me look bad. However,
                    my problems under Kissinger were puny in comparison to the ill-considered moves
                    we later made under Brzezinski's influence. A few additional comments about
                    Kissinger's China travels. During my first visit with Kissinger back to the land
                    of my birth in the fall of 1974, Deng was very much in charge. The meetings with
                    him were quite fascinating to me if only because they were my first exposure to
                    the process I have just described. Then in 1975 there were two important visits,
                    one a preparatory trip by Kissinger in the early fall and the other by President
                    Ford toward the end of the year. At the time the PRC was undergoing leadership
                    struggles; Mao Zedong was in the final stages of his life as was Zhou En-lai.
                    Deng had already moved to take a leadership role but unbeknownst to us had run
                    into difficulties with Mao and leftist rivals, requiring him to take more
                    cautious positions. The problem was reflected in the foreign ministry which was
                    in a state of flux and less helpful than in the past. And perhaps it played some
                    part in a sophomoric Chinese effort to tweak Kissinger into a more cooperative
                    stance.</p>
                <p>Almost coinciding with our delegation's arrival in Beijing we read foreign press
                    stories, date-lined Beijing, stating that Chinese officials were unhappy with
                    Kissinger's failure to complete the normalization process and that they were
                    going to invite Defense Secretary Schlesinger to visit China to move things
                    along. Kissinger, who saw himself as having earned a very special, if not
                    unique, place in U.S. dealings with China, was furious over this ploy and set
                    about showing the Chinese who was running China policy in the U.S. government.
                    And he did this quite well. Even if he didn't like the treatment of Kissinger,
                    Deng must have known about this petty gamesmanship.</p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>During this preparatory trip, we were trying to get the PRC to agree on a
                    communique announcing Ford's visit, and we wanted to insert some creative
                    language along the lines of the Shanghai communique to fortify it with a sense
                    of incremental progress. Our PRC counterparts understood what we were trying to
                    do, and they didn't want to help us build a half way house to normalization.
                    They wanted a timetable and public commitment. In wording that I slaved over
                    with Dick Solomon of the NSC and Oscar Armstrong, one our key China officers, we
                    concocted a statement declaring that normalization was our common goal, vaguely
                    implying progress, but lacking any specifics about substance or timing. The PRC
                    didn't like it and was determined to squeeze more out of us. The Chinese in
                    effect told us no communique and no Ford visit were preferable to ratifying our
                    procrastination.</p>
                <p>After our sessions with Deng, we had provided the PRC with a draft communique
                    early in the evening, and we hoped they would accept it so we could wrap it up
                    by the next morning. Instead, the Chinese sent us a counter version about
                    midnight. I no longer remember its contents, but it was quite unacceptable.
                    Kissinger called a small group of us to his room, including Habib, Lord, and
                    myself. I remember the infernal quacking machine that was supposed to muffle
                    words enough so they could not picked up by monitoring devices. This was one of
                    the few times when I felt Kissinger was listening to me carefully. He asked me a
                    series of questions about what I thought the Chinese were up to. He absorbed my
                    answers and seemed to weigh seriously all the points I was making. He even
                    accepted the thrust of my recommendations. For me, this degree of attention was
                    a singular event. I said I thought that the main issue was a political judgment
                    about the importance of the president's visit. Was it critically important, or
                    were we willing to risk its cancellation? Assuming the latter, I explained that
                    cancellation might be even more of a problem for the PRC than for us, and I
                    therefore advocated a hard line, responding to the PRC in the tough manner that
                    they had used with us. I suspected they would eventually become more reasonable.
                    There was a consensus among us to do this so we sent a firm message back and
                    after some dickering the PRC agreed on a compromise statement of some sort.</p>
                <p>I was pleased by the outcome. I might add that, personally, I thought
                    cancellation of Ford's visit would have been most unfortunate. Normally I am not
                    a high stakes gambler.</p>
                <p>To spite the Chinese for their behavior over the Kissinger communique, we
                    slightly “downgraded” the Ford visit to China by combining it with a stop in
                    Indonesia, theoretically making the Chinese share the limelight with Southeast
                    Asia. Ford's summit sessions with Deng and Mao were not a great turning point in
                    Sino-US relations. They were harmonious but didn't really resolve any of the
                    major outstanding issues. I remember when discussion at the last session with
                    Deng concluded before its allotted time and Deng was about to let people enjoy a
                    few free minutes, Ford embarrassedly urged him to keep talking so as not to
                    provoke media interest.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>It was also during the same contentious preparatory visit in the early fall of
                    1975 that I had my one and only glimpse of Mao Zedong. Perhaps Kissinger
                    included me as a reward, more likely because Habib told him to do so. I remember
                    the Chinese kept us in the dark as to whether any of us would see Mao and when.
                    Even after there was an agreed list and general time, they had us sight-see the
                    Forbidden City, waiting for word from on high. The session, which took place in
                    Mao's study, was substantively questionable, but the symbolism was important to
                    Kissinger, and I was delighted to have a chance to gawk at a man who in his
                    younger days was certainly one of the main figures of the 20th Century.</p>
                <p>As we filed in, Mao greeted Secretary and Mrs. Kissinger effusively, grunting a
                    few words in his Hunanese dialect that were translated first by his niece into
                    mandarin and then by Nancy Tang into English. Despite my language ability, I
                    couldn't follow the dialogue, but it seemed rather contrived. One grunt became
                    many coherent English sentences, etc. Not necessarily phony, but surely padded
                    out by Mao's female assistants. By far the most interesting phenomenon was the
                    interplay between Mao and Deng. All other Chinese were reverential and
                    obsequious toward Mao. Not Deng, who, while showing no disrespect, treated Mao
                    as a peer. I couldn't read much into Mao's reaction except that I sensed a
                    distinct lack of fondness. As a “China watcher” I found this intriguing. (After
                    about fifteen minutes of this, most of us were escorted out leaving Kissinger,
                    Ambassador Bush, and Winston Lord to carry on with Mao.)</p>
                <p>The Chinese were very effective in their efforts to fence us off from observing
                    their domestic strife. Although we came across occasional nuggets, such as I
                    have just described, we needed far more information to dope out who was doing
                    what to whom with what consequences for our dealings with China. We had
                    virtually no worthwhile intelligence reports and, like the Chinese people, we
                    were forced to rely on clues from the media, such as the anti-Confucius campaign
                    conducted against Zhou and Deng by the leftists, and occasional bits of luck, a
                    process I described at some length in recounting my Hong Kong tour. We
                    speculated about what was going on, and we had some feel for the emerging
                    post-Mao era, but we had little evidence of the rugged struggles going on.</p>
                <p>Not long after this glimpse of Mao and Deng, I was back in Beijing for the Ford
                    visit, and instead of going on with the delegation to Jakarta I stayed a few
                    extra days during which I bought a Chinese Communist periodical to read on the
                    plane to Tokyo. I was struck by a prominent article that had the flavor of
                    pieces written just before and during the height of the Cultural Revolution. The
                    article mentioned Deng in unflattering terms completely out of keeping with
                    previous commentaries. I alerted my colleagues in Washington, but we didn't
                    recognize that we had stumbled across pretty clear evidence that Deng was being
                    ousted from his leadership role.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>I forgot to mention another of these nuggets of intelligence about what was
                    happening within the Chinese leadership in Mao's declining days. In the spring
                    of 1975 I accompanied the Speaker of the House, Carl Albert, and the Minority
                    Leader, John Rhodes, with their wives on an official visit to China. Although I
                    was experienced with Congressional travel, this visit was exceptionally
                    difficult, because of the Speaker's great fondness for drink as well as a
                    self-centered, provincial American style that he maintained regardless of the
                    occasion. His Chinese hosts let me know that they were offended by his
                    interruption and his monopolizing conversations, mostly to offer anecdotes about
                    minutiae or describe the wonders of the U.S. Constitution. Despite the Minority
                    Leader's noble help, I was not able to prevent Albert's starting off in the same
                    manner with Deng Xiaoping who flushed with anger and seemed about to break off
                    the session. Fortunately, Deng calmed down and then delivered a long exposition
                    on China's need for decades of peace so it could attract foreign investment and
                    develop itself economically through a mixed socialist/market system.</p>
                <p>Deng's statement was a much longer and more systematic presentation than we had
                    heard from him in 1974, and it was delivered with a tone of real conviction,
                    probably reflecting the challenges he was encountering from the “Gang of Four.”
                    The Speaker, who managed to interrupt Deng two or three times, displayed no
                    interest when I later told him the importance of Deng's message. In fact, none
                    of us appreciated its full significance until Deng was temporarily overwhelmed
                    by the leftist radicals about six months later.</p>
                <p>I should clarify my comments about the state of Sino-U.S. relations in the
                    mid-1970s. When I spoke of lack of progress or stalemate, I was referring to the
                    normalization process and our inability to move it forward. We, for domestic
                    political reasons, were reluctant to take the leap, while the PRC was eager to
                    conclude the process. In a broader context, however, our relationship with the
                    PRC was greatly improved; in fact, it was quite solid in some respects,
                    particularly in relation to our mutual concern over the Soviet Union. We were
                    becoming more and more engaged with the PRC. The new relationship allowed us to
                    bring intelligence experts to Beijing to share aerial photography of Soviet
                    deployments. We were talking about using PRC territory to add to our
                    intelligence collection capability. There were times when I thought that we
                    treated the PRC better than Japanese or Korean allies. That bothered me, and I
                    expressed my view to Kissinger, to his displeasure.</p>
                <p>There were, of course, problems. For one, there were personality conflicts. As I
                    indicated earlier, the PRC had become somewhat annoyed with Kissinger and his
                    style, and this sometimes affected the atmosphere of meetings. The core problem
                    was Taiwan. The PRC was not buying any of Kissinger's formulations. They
                    repeatedly reaffirmed the language of the Shanghai communique - as far as they
                    were concerned, there was only one interpretation, their interpretation. For us,
                    Taiwan's future security was the most troublesome element. In 1974-76 the PRC
                    showed no flexibility on this issue; it was going to be their way - i.e. no
                    American military relationship after normalization - or nothing at all.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>Of course there were problems in addition to Taiwan. Kissinger would have liked a
                    more assertive and confrontational PRC policy toward the Soviet Union. He often
                    made elliptical references to this objective but was never very specific about
                    it. He also tried to involve the PRC in Korea and Vietnam without much success,
                    which was the experience of his predecessors and successors. In fact, the PRC
                    did not help us much, if at all, on Korean matters in those days, and it greatly
                    disappointed Kissinger on Vietnam, playing it own cards in the peace process and
                    substantially aiding North Vietnam's war effort - despite the latter's heavy
                    tilt toward the Soviets.</p>
                <p>In turn, the Chinese, who were quite shy of real danger and firmly determined to
                    avoid the risk of serious military conflict with the Soviets, nevertheless
                    wanted the highest possible tension between the Soviets and ourselves short of
                    war. They kept telling Kissinger the Soviets' main target was Europe and
                    ourselves, asking Kissinger why we followed a policy of detente, why we were so
                    interested in arms control agreements when we could have far outmatched the
                    Soviets in military spending, and so on. In the final analysis, neither the PRC
                    nor we managed to alter each other's basic behavior.</p>
                <p>I saw Kissinger in action not only on China, but also on Japan and Korea and
                    sometimes Southeast Asia. Clearly, China was the topic of greatest interest to
                    him; I would say that 80 percent of our meetings were on that subject. I
                    mentioned earlier that there were times when I could not get through to the
                    Secretary. For example, it was becoming clear that the Japanese mood was
                    changing from post-war depression to a more normal national pride. This was a
                    most important development for East Asia. While this was going on - and
                    Kissinger was not only aware of it but quite talkative with the Chinese about it
                    - he was fawning over the PRC, talking about the wonders of China's leaders and
                    the greatness of Chinese civilization. Although the Japanese had also made a
                    large mark for themselves and happened to be our allies, they sensed Kissinger
                    was rather dismissive of them. From my own observation, I would agree that
                    neither he nor his staff showed enough responsiveness to Japanese concerns. When
                    the Japanese made reasonable requests for attention, they tended to get short
                    changed in relation to China or West Europeans. Effectively, they were treated
                    as second class citizens, carelessly ridiculed in discussions with the Chinese.
                    If the Japanese ambassador wished to have an appointment with a high level
                    official to discuss a soybean emergency, he would be deflected down to see
                    Habib, whereas we thought nothing of asking the U.S. ambassador in Tokyo to see
                    the foreign minister, or better yet the prime minister, about far less
                    consequential matters. This was upsetting to the Japanese and embarrassing to
                    us. Japan just didn't rank very high on Kissinger's agenda. I thought that Japan
                    was far too important to be treated so cavalierly.</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>When the PRC normalized relations with Japan in 1972, the two countries side
                    stepped the issue of a treaty of peace, Japan having signed the 1952 San
                    Francisco Peace Treaty with us and 48 other countries, including the Republic of
                    China under Chiang Kai-shek. In the mid 70s, the Chinese successfully pressed
                    Japan to negotiate a treaty of peace and friendship, something that was
                    completely unnecessary from the viewpoint of international law but a favorite
                    gimmick of both the communist hegemonies. The Chinese proved very hard-nosed
                    about the language they wanted to include, particularly a gratuitous reference
                    opposing hegemony that was clearly aimed at the USSR. This was at a time when
                    the Japanese were trying to improve their relations with the Soviet Union, so
                    they resisted the Chinese demand in what was a bilateral squabble over a petty
                    matter. Kissinger sided with the Chinese, although not as brazenly as
                    Brzezinski. To jump ahead for a minute, Brzezinski in 1978 took it upon himself
                    to tell Prime Minister Fukuda that the U.S. did not object to the clause and
                    favored conclusion of the treaty. The Japanese felt cornered and humbled by
                    Brzezinski's simplistic anti-Soviet gamesmanship. In my opinion, it was a
                    needless insult to an ally; the PRC didn't deserve our support for its
                    hypocritical rhetoric denouncing hegemony.</p>
                <p>To put it bluntly, I felt our allies in Asia deserved higher priority than they
                    usually got from Kissinger. I feared that treating Japan this way would
                    ultimately provoke a nationalistic reaction, which wouldn't be in our interest -
                    or China's. Although I was outspoken about this, Kissinger and his inner circle
                    seemed indifferent</p>
                <p>I have no reason to question that intellectually Kissinger appreciated Japan's
                    importance to us, and I understood his preoccupation with China in relation to
                    the Soviet theat. Even so, I am convinced he could have - and should have -
                    handled the Japanese more skillfully. Apart from time pressures, etc, I suspect
                    he was influenced by Chinese skill in managing (and manipulating) foreigners in
                    contrast to Japanese awkwardness in complex discussion with foreigners.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>I remember one important exception to this general tendency; i.e. the Tanaka
                    scandal involving bribery of Prime Minister Tanaka by Lockheed, the American
                    aircraft manufacturer. Kissinger paid close attention to what was happening
                    during the resulting crisis and closed ranks with his fellow conservatives in
                    the LDP. My own reaction, uncharacteristic, since I was usually the voice in the
                    Department defending the Japanese, was that our relations with Japan and
                    Japanese society as a whole might be improved if the Japanese went through a
                    real cleansing, even if that meant that the LDP lost the next election. I
                    favored taking a tough line with the Japanese, but I was overruled by Kissinger
                    who tended to dismiss me as a novice regarding Japan. In this case, Kissinger
                    showed his Metternich tendencies. He did not want to upset the stability of the
                    Japanese political system; he wanted to help the Japanese conservatives - all
                    honorable objectives, and he displayed the proper kind of concern by a secretary
                    of state - even though I disagreed with him. The crunch issue that we wrestled
                    with was the degree of pressure we should apply to the Japanese to get them to
                    reveal the full nature of the scandal. There were prosecutors in both countries
                    who were anxious to nail the perpetrators. Eventually, we went along with the
                    Japanese in a drawn out investigation that nevertheless destroyed the powerful
                    Mr. Tanaka. Not surprisingly, the LDP survived.</p>
                <p>In the soybean crisis I mentioned earlier, the Japanese wanted assurances that
                    the supply line would continue. Soybeans were a major US export to Japan. Yet
                    when we had a severe shortage, we embargoed all exports without much
                    consideration being given to Japan and our other steady customers, who were of
                    course furious about our decision. I believe some exceptions were made but no
                    prompt action was taken to help the Japanese. The ultimate effect was a Japanese
                    decision to take control of some of the US business in this country as well as
                    to diversify their procurement to other countries, including China. In this
                    instance and in the second oil crisis in 1974 Kissinger may have sympathized
                    with the Japanese, but he didn't spend any chips on them.</p>
                <p>The Japanese ambassador, who was so often given short shrift by Kissinger's
                    staff, was capable and trustworthy. Habib did very well by him and tried to
                    massage his bruised feelings. Less sympathetic persons around the secretary were
                    sometimes not as careful. They explained to the Japanese that Kissinger was a
                    very busy man who had to focus on the Soviet Union and new diplomatic
                    initiatives, such as with the PRC; these were at the heart of U.S. national
                    security and demanded his undivided attention. On other occasions, the Japanese
                    were told via the media that were being given short shrift because they could
                    not keep secrets. This really offended them, even if it was partially true. The
                    worst insult of all to the Japanese came from those who justified our treatment
                    of Japan by aggressively questioning their standing among other Asians,
                    reminding them, for example, of their colonial exploits and aggression.</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>Apart from these not very happy memories of Kissinger's involvement with Japan,
                    the East Asian bureau spent a great deal of time dealing with Japan matters,
                    which is what one would expect of such an important country. Much of it was
                    economic in character and related to trade practices that were already a source
                    of serious friction. STR (or its precursor) and Commerce dominated the handling
                    of these issues with Japan, but in those days our bureau and our seventh floor
                    were still able to inject far more foreign policy concern into the battles than
                    they are today. Habib had the chutzpah and fighter qualities to make a
                    difference. Moreover, the bureau befitted from a strong crew of Japan
                    specialists who knew Japan and treated it with sophistication and sympathy.
                    Although I did my bit as well as I could, the key player was Bill Sherman, our
                    Japan Country Director and senior specialist on the Japanese matters. I was
                    impressed both by his bureaucratic effectiveness and by the way he selected and
                    nurtured the careers of his fellow Japan specialists. Tending loving care from
                    Habib, Sherman, and me took the edge off Japanese resentment over Kissinger's
                    shabby treatment.</p>
                <p>My third area of concentration under Habib was Korea where we were faced with a
                    variety of problems: human rights and political governance, nuclear weapons
                    development, U.S. military deployments, and the “Koreagate” bribery scandal.
                    Since I have covered these at some length in my book, Massive Entanglement,
                    Marginal Influence, Carter and Korea in Crisis, Brookings Institution Press,
                    1999, I will limit my comments here.</p>
                <p>Human rights problems and Koreagate were most corrosive in their impact on
                    American attitudes, which shifted in a few years from growing admiration for
                    South Korea's economic leap to dismay over its political repression. In the eyes
                    of many in the church, labor unions, media, and Congress, South Korea had become
                    a political pariah - a favorite target for the bashers. The principal reason was
                    President Park Chung Hee's abrupt, rightward shift in the early 1970s to a
                    regime of political repression. Worried domestically that Kim Dae Jung had
                    almost defeated him in the 1971 election and convinced, almost paranoically,
                    that the U.S. was going to downgrade its commitment to Korea as it had in
                    Vietnam, Park adopted self defense measures. He introduced a harsh new
                    authoritarian constitution and other means to circumscribe political activity,
                    let his cronies kidnap Kim Dae Jung from a Tokyo hotel and almost kill him,
                    authorized an ill-conceived bribery operation among American officials and
                    Congress, began a costly buildup of defense industries, and covertly launched a
                    nuclear weapons program. All but symbolic vestiges of democracy were lost;
                    Park's critics were harassed and jailed; and much of the urban populace was
                    intimidated. The only bright spots were continuing progress in economic and
                    social welfare in rural as well as urban areas. Granting that average citizens
                    were not much affected, the atmosphere was ugly for anyone inclined to criticize
                    Park or protest his regime.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>The kidnaping of Kim Dae Jung caught peoples' attention in spectacular fashion.
                    The crudeness and barbarity of Korean intelligence operations in Japan was
                    exposed at great cost to Korea's prestige. Militant foreign missionaries and
                    other human rights activists in Seoul descended on Ambassador Sneider to
                    denounce our support of Park, and in Washington the church, labor unions, and
                    media activated considerably more than the left liberal fringe in the
                    Congress.</p>
                <p>By the fall of 1974 when I arrived back in Washington the activist core within
                    the House and Senate was firing very heavy salvos at Park Chung Hee. Congressmen
                    Donald Fraser, a really zealous human rights advocate from Minnesota, and a
                    small group on the House International Relations Committee were in the
                    forefront. They were vituperative about Park and his regime, frequently demanded
                    that Habib testify, asked for more and more reports (a process that eventually
                    culminated in the State Department's human rights report on the world), and by
                    1975 began to insinuate the issue of troop withdrawals into the human rights
                    debate. Steve Solarz, who shared some of Fraser's views on human rights but not
                    security, allowed his East Asian Subcommittee to be used as a battleground. In
                    the Senate there was even more bombast but less action. The most extreme critic
                    was McGovern who called for the United States Government to withdraw military
                    support from Korea, but he was often joined by Kennedy, Cranston and others who
                    were more reasonable on security issues. Opposing them were a few anti-communist
                    crusaders who sometimes rose to defend the Park regime as a bastion of the “free
                    world.” The ideological divide between these extremes was so wide that to have
                    reasonable and rational conversation with either was very difficult, if not
                    impossible.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, the pro-Korea and anti-Korea groups were a minority; the majority of
                    members in both the House and Senate approached the issue more pragmatically.
                    However, even sympathetic individuals, such as Nunn, Glenn, Percy, Zablocki and
                    others, were also angry with Park and tended to leave the Administration with
                    the unpleasant task of justifying our continued relations with Park.</p>
                <p>The peak of trouble during this period was in 1975-76 when Fraser tried first to
                    introduce legislation that would have called for a phased withdrawal of US
                    forces from Korea and when that was squelched a rider requiring the
                    Administration to report each year for five years on the feasibility of a phased
                    reduction of US forces. The latter was finally accepted by the Administration as
                    the lesser evil.</p>
                <p>Habib bore the brunt of the assault on Korea, testifying frequently and spending
                    much time talking to individual representatives and senators. Most of the time I
                    was with him, and I was usually left to follow up or make further trips to the
                    Hill on my own or with a member of our Korean desk. It was not easy to explain
                    to “one-issue” people the complex of reasons we needed peace and stability on
                    the Korean peninsula. But we did so at great length, and ultimately we were able
                    to hold the line with the help of moderate Democrats and Republicans.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>Koreagate began while I was serving as deputy assistant secretary. A couple of
                    years later it would of course become public as a major scandal, but in the
                    period we are discussing we only had a few indications of a Korean program
                    intended to “raise Congressional appreciation of Korean issues.” We suspected
                    Korean gifts and money through the Korean CIA and its agents but we certainly
                    did not know the extent. Being in and out of Korean affairs complicates my
                    memory. I do remember wondering why certain congressmen made such regular
                    pilgrimages to Seoul. Although there were a number of conservatives who were
                    wooed and responded positively to Korean embassy entreaties, these were only the
                    tip of the iceberg. Many of the real targets seemed to have been Democrats,
                    including “liberals.” In short, I remember spasmodic reports of Koreans larding
                    their lobbying with money and favors, no names, and no real evidence.</p>
                <p>Nuclear proliferation was a major issue, and I was dealing with Korean affairs at
                    the time we finally took action in 1975. As I mentioned earlier, my first brush
                    with clandestine nuclear weapons programs was a similar operation in Taiwan. By
                    the time I arrived in EA, CIA had collected a lot of information on the Korean
                    program. I took a very strong stand against Korea being allowed to develop a
                    nuclear weapons, not only as a general non-proliferation matter but also out of
                    concern for the potential impact on Japan and North Korea. It was quite a long
                    struggle before we could Kissinger to focus on this, and we first tried to
                    deflect the Koreans by way of our allies Canada (which was providing plutonium
                    producing heavy water reactors) and France (which was providing reprocessing
                    technology). Once we concluded our allies weren't going to carry the bucket for
                    us, Kissinger agreed to a frontal approach, making crystal clear to Park Chung
                    Hee himself that continuation of the hanky-panky would undermine our security
                    relationship. After some squirming around, Park finally agreed to stand down the
                    program, moth-balling it rather than dismantling it. I would give Kissinger, the
                    Department, the Embassy, and CIA good marks for a job well done.</p>
                <p>Another issue was our security presence on the Peninsula. That was reviewed
                    almost continually at working levels within the Executive Branch, and the
                    virtually unanimous consensus was that we needed to maintain a significant
                    ground combat and air combat presence in South Korea. Some of us, myself
                    included, were open to the possibility of modest adjustments, and we knew we had
                    to cope with arguments about the priority of reinforcing NATO, about saving
                    money, and about the political cost of our association with Park and his human
                    rights record. I don't recall any sympathy in the executive branch for the kind
                    of ideas floated by Governor Jimmy Carter, although there was some resonance in
                    Congress. In any event, the uncertainly being generated in East Asia by the
                    denouement in Vietnam, caused me and most of my colleagues to want to hold the
                    line firmly in Korea. I was staggered by the thinking, or lack of thinking, by
                    people such as Fraser and McGovern - and their ambitious staffers.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>Before giving you some miscellaneous recollections about my time with Habib, I
                    want to make a concluding comment about Secretary Kissinger. Along with many of
                    my Foreign Service colleagues who worked for him I found Kissinger very bright,
                    conceptual, politically skillful, decisive, and terribly energetic. There is no
                    question he had much insight about a complex world and a dazzling didactic
                    ability to convey his views persuasively to others. But there was a distinctly
                    negative side to the man that frequently bothered me. He was too inclined toward
                    self adulation as well as mockery and derision of others, particularly those
                    below him in rank, wealth, or brains. More disturbing to me, he was also too
                    comfortable in manipulating people and facts, apparently justifying it by the
                    nobility of the causes to which he was dedicated. When he displayed these
                    characteristics toward hostile groups or opponents I was not too bothered, but
                    when he dealt this way within his own camp, it really jarred my own moral
                    standards. I found it reprehensible. I don't think my reaction was a case of
                    sour grapes. By Kissinger's rugged standards, he generally treated me pretty
                    well as a competent bureaucrat and useful resource person on China. I was given
                    adequate access to sensitive information; and my views were allowed to trickle
                    up to the great man himself or at least into his inner circle.</p>
                <p>I must admit that I was never comfortable in Kissinger's presence, and there were
                    times he really annoyed me by arbitrarily singling me out as the person
                    responsible for something that he didn't like. I will never forget an
                    infuriating instance of this. When the last withdrawals of our Air Force
                    contingents on Taiwan were being implemented - a subject that I knew well from
                    working on it in both Taiwan and Washington - I responded to questions from
                    Bernie Gwertzman of the New York Times, carefully hewing to the party line and
                    doing it on a background basis. The same day the Times story appeared,
                    thChristian Science Monitor also printed a fuller story, the source of which I
                    think must have been Kissinger or someone close to him. The Monitor story went
                    beyond the limits we had set on the discussion of this issue, even though it was
                    not a catastrophe, and the thrust - the drive to normalization with the PRC -
                    was correct. In any case, the two newspaper stories got confused in Kissinger's
                    mind or imagination. He accused me of having leaked sensitive information,
                    whereas I hadn't even talked to the Christian Science Monitor. When I learned
                    that Kissinger had the FBI investigating me, I went in fury to see Larry
                    Eagleburger - Kissinger's man who was then the Deputy Under Secretary for
                    Management. I raised hell about what was being done to me - the lie that was
                    being circulated - and after a few days the matter was dropped. The next time I
                    saw Kissinger, I protested angrily. He didn't apologize, more or less laughing
                    off my complaints. I never forgave him for subjecting me to calumny to give
                    cover to the real culprit, who might have been Kissinger himself. Fortunately I
                    didn't have many experiences of that kind, but I saw a lot of it happen to
                    others.</p>
                <p>Despite my sharp criticism, I still strike a positive balance in assessing Henry
                    Kissinger as secretary of state. Although it is premature to make a definitive
                    statement about his place in history, he will certainly be regarded as one of
                    the greatest to serve in the 20th Century, considerably more impressive than his
                    peers.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>Now for the miscellaneous points. Thinking about Koreagate reminds me of Taiwan's
                    extensive lobbying activity in those days with both the Congress and White
                    House. I felt uncomfortable with those efforts that surely involved money and
                    favors. There was some similarity between Taiwan and Korea on this score,
                    although there was no evidence of direct bribery as in the Korean case. The
                    Taiwan government ran a well oiled operation, less brazen than the notorious
                    “China lobby” of older days but still very generous and often obnoxious in
                    trying to get its way - and complicate our efforts toward normalization of
                    relations with the PRC. Ironically, the Taiwan independence lobby, working
                    separately with different contacts, used similar techniques, resulting in lots
                    of lobbying from the beleaguered island.</p>
                <p>Which brings me to intelligence relationships. Habib kept the sensitive part of
                    the process pretty much to himself. He shared information quite liberally, but
                    he was cagey about sources of intelligence and actions he had approved. That was
                    hard on his deputies. Fortunately, we ourselves had pretty good contacts with
                    CIA and knew much of what the head of its East AsiDivision was doing. Habib
                    almost always met privately with this man and allowed him to undertake
                    operations that we might not have approved. Most of these concerned Southeast
                    Asia. The result of this compartmentalization was that we deputies had to be
                    careful about where we stepped lest we interfere with an activity already
                    approved by Habib. For example, 1975-76, there was a major drive to reduce the
                    government's overseas presence; it had gotten out of hand during the Vietnam
                    era. The Department was eager to cooperate so long as there was a mechanism to
                    ensure that CIA and the military intelligence agencies took their fair share. We
                    deputies pushed and pushed for the reductions in our various countries of
                    responsibility only to find periodically that Habib was undercutting us.</p>
                <p>I think it was just Phil's instinct to work that way with the intelligence
                    community. Perhaps he developed the habit from the 1950s when he had lots of CIA
                    dealings in Cold War hot spots. I don't think he was intentionally trying to
                    play games with us; more likely that he underestimated the potential perils of
                    excessive secrecy. In any event senior CIA operatives needed to be watched
                    closely, and it was the one area where I found Habib's modus operandi unhelpful.
                    It taught me a lesson; when I became an ambassador, I demanded that the station
                    chief, Bob Brewster give me a full account of his operations, which he did
                    willing, and I shared my knowledge with my DCMs, at least giving them the big
                    picture if sometimes forced to fuzz the details.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>Covert actions were naturally the kind of thing where the Central Intelligence
                    Agency found it convenient to approach Habib alone, because they knew that one
                    or another of his deputies might disapprove. I suspect that on occasion Habib
                    kept us in the dark even when we asked. State-CIA relations in EA under Habib
                    were a murky area, compared to the Holbrooke/Gleysteen era in EA,
                    1977-78.Finally, I was spread too thin, trying fitfully to cover other parts of
                    East Asia at various times. The PRC and Taiwan were my steady diet, and I
                    covered Japan and Korea most of the time, so I was able to give Northeast Asia
                    my best. Other countries came under my wing in fits and starts. The word was
                    “what's left over, give to Gleysteen, the junior DAS.” The frequent changes in
                    assignments taught me a lesson about the Bureau of East Asian and Pacific
                    Affairs. Without competent country directors, we would have been in real
                    trouble. I learned the importance of these key officers and began to spend more
                    time identifying candidates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then in 1976, you were assigned to the National Security
                        Council.How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLEYSTEEN: The assignment came from the top. When Dick Solomon was thinking of
                    leaving his China job at the NSC in 1975, there was some pressure on me to
                    replace him. I resisted because it would have narrowed my responsibilities.
                    Other arrangements were made in the NSC, but in 1976 Brent Scowcroft combined
                    China with all of East Asia in a four person unit and personally offered me the
                    job of heading it. Kissinger let me know he wanted me in the NSC, either as a
                    promotion or to get me out of his hair in the Department. I was attracted by the
                    job but not its timing - just before presidential elections. So I temporized.
                    Finally, Larry Eagleburger gave me a boy scout lecture from his perch as the
                    under secretary supervising assignments. In effect, he told me I was under
                    orders from Kissinger to go to the NSC. If I refused, I might find myself
                    banished to some forsaken place. I capitulated and became the senior staff
                    member for East Asia in the NSC around June, 1976.</p>
                <p>I had a good relationship with Scowcroft, which was important because, absent
                    that, I would have been miserable. His door was always open to me - even though
                    I sometimes had to wait until 9 p.m. if I needed more than a few minutes of his
                    time. He would always listen carefully and seemed to appreciate my advice. Of
                    course, he got a lot of advice from many quarters - often quite often
                    conflicting. I found that it always helped if Kissinger was leaning the
                    direction in that I wanted to go.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>Bill Hyland was the deputy. Colonel Bud McFarland, as the senior assistant, spent
                    a lot of time sifting through the volumes and materials received from the
                    departments and agencies to winnow out the nuggets for Hyland and Scowcroft.
                    This was after the NSC regional and functional staffs had already screened the
                    documents to determine which were important enough to send to the front office
                    with a covering memo and recommendations. The decision on whether to send it on
                    in to the president was Scowcroft's. He and only he decided what was to go the
                    president and in what form. My memory of the three of them in their cramped
                    quarters in the White House is dominated by the mounds of paper on their desks.
                    I admired Brent for his diligence and intelligence and his centrist approach to
                    foreign affairs. I didn't see enough of the NSC's over-all operations or even my
                    own area long enough to judge the efficiency of Scowcroft's operation. I suspect
                    he should have been more selective and had more assistance from one or two more
                    Hylands. He was always overwhelmed by paper, compensating for covering the
                    waterfront by sacrificing his entire private life.</p>
                <p>I had three officers working for me: Alan Romberg (China), Jay Taylor (Korea and
                    Japan) and Ken Quinn (Southeast Asia). My main responsibility was to supervise
                    the work of these three analysts and to serve as Scowcroft's East Asia
                    person.</p>
                <p>The issues which are most memorable dealt with Korea, including tree cutting
                    event at the DMZ in August 1976, hardline development in China, and Indochinese
                    refugees. The murder of two of our officers at Panmunjom in August 1976 was a
                    tense moment. I was struck by the difficulties we had in getting a clear picture
                    of what was going on. Obviously our people in Seoul also had problems in getting
                    reliable information. Things were made more difficult by reports coming through
                    a variety of military, embassy, and intelligence channels. After receiving the
                    first sketchy military report, we met in the situation room in a meeting chaired
                    by Kissinger, I believe, with senior representatives of all involved agencies.
                    The senior military officer was the acting chairman of the JCS, an admiral. We
                    thrashed around in considerable confusion. It was hard to decide what we should
                    do without knowing more about what had happened. With the exception of Habib, no
                    one in the room was familiar with the peculiarities of Panmunjom — the location
                    of buildings, the distribution of forces, the location of the tree, etc. Habib,
                    by then under secretary of State, was very helpful, describing the place and
                    suggesting that before any conclusions were reached, a full understanding of the
                    Panmunjom operations was necessary. The picture improved greatly after the
                    embassy sent in an analysis that put the incident in some context.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>Throughout the discussions, I was struck by Kissinger's hard line. He may have
                    genuinely favored a major military move or he may just have been speaking for
                    the record so history would show that he was a tough guy. In any event, he
                    proposed or inquired about the use of almost every military means available,
                    short of nuclear weapons - including surgical missile strikes and bombing of
                    North Korea. The JCS were extremely cautious for the same sorts of reasons cited
                    more recently in regard to our intervention in Bosnia and Kosovo. I was a little
                    surprised by Kissinger's aggressive position. On the other hand, I felt that the
                    JCS were a bit too cautious. All of us, including Kissinger, backed away from
                    proposals that were judged to risk war, and most tended to view what happened at
                    Panmunjom as an incident, not part of an aggressive North Korean pattern.</p>
                <p>Compared to crisis management when I returned to the State Department, I thought
                    the Panmunjom situation was handled quite well - communications were prompt,
                    information was distributed quickly and properly, and there were strong working
                    groups under Habib. Art Hummel, then the assistant secretary for EA was in
                    charge of Team A; I was in charge of Team B, the difference being working hours.
                    Anyone who had a contribution to make was given the opportunity to do so.</p>
                <p>As I said, there was an abysmal ignorance in Washington at the beginning of the
                    crisis, and adequate knowledge was lacking throughout the incident. At the
                    beginning, our major concern was North Korean motivation. Was the axing to death
                    of two American officers a display of local zealotry or the beginning of a
                    dangerous shift in North Korean policy on the Peninsula? What was the reaction
                    in Beijing and Moscow? With hindsight, we discovered both the PRC and the Soviet
                    Union were cautious. Kim Il Sung ultimately proved cautious too. After we cut
                    down the tree with a large show of force he wrote General Stilwell, our CINC in
                    Korea, more or less apologizing and signaling a desire to cool it.</p>
                <p>There was some difference of views on the final decisions taken by the US
                    government. Despite the hawks (Kissinger and Park Chung Hee) and doves (JCS),
                    President Ford agreed with the majority, including our representatives in Korea,
                    to demonstrate forcefully that we were not going to be pushed around, yet not to
                    punish the DPRK with measures that might have escalated into war. At the time, I
                    liked the concept of a tough working party backed up by a battalion of heavily
                    armed troops and air-cover from planes deployed from the States. I felt
                    Stilwell's idea of making our troops even more visible by deploying observers in
                    helicopters was a bit dangerous. In retrospect, I think it was a probably a good
                    idea.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>Finally, it is worth noting that the incident occurred in the middle of the
                    Republican Convention. Ford was already in Kansas City. As I recall Scowcroft
                    was with him initially and then Kissinger at a later stage. The political
                    process complicated crisis management but it didn't deflect Ford from the right
                    decision. The hawks in the Republican Party didn't complain loudly, even though
                    there was some snickering - cartoons mocked our use of a battalion of soldiers
                    and F-111s flown across the Pacific to trim a tree. The Democrats never made it
                    a partisan issue, and as far as I can tell, no damage was done to Ford
                    politically.</p>
                <p>The mood of the country was difficult to judge at the beginning of the crisis.
                    Although we were still feeling the aftershocks of our withdrawal from Vietnam,
                    we were past the low point. There was growing evidence that people agreed we
                    should not withdraw from the world. The Panmunjom incident was a test. Our guess
                    was that if we handled the incident with care, we could get public support, and
                    we did.</p>
                <p>On a more important matter, we did not entertain any radical thoughts about our
                    troop presence in Korea during my time under Scowcroft. When candidate Jimmy
                    Carter first broached his deep thoughts about the matter in 1975, I didn't know
                    much about the governor or that he planned open heart surgery on our security
                    commitment to Korea. Many candidates in the primary said many strange things,
                    and I didn't pay much attention to them. By the time Carter became the
                    Democratic Party nominee I had heard about his pledge to withdraw all our combat
                    troops from Korea. I thought it was a crazy idea, the exact opposite of what we
                    should be doing.</p>
                <p>We talked a lot within the government about our military presence in Korea. I had
                    a staffer who toyed with Carter's idea of a pullback. We also had an NSC
                    colleague dealing with Europe who wanted to transfer troops from Korea to Europe
                    so as to reinforce NATO. On the outside some of our friends in the human rights
                    movement, Jerry Cohen, for example, talked in Carterish ways. Some of them must
                    have helped author Carter's policy. But withdrawal of forces from Korea was not
                    on our minds; on the contrary, we were under great pressure to sustain our East
                    Asian military deployments.</p>
                <p>As I have said previously, I myself was open minded about the shape of our
                    military presence in South Korea. I couldn't imagine an intelligent president
                    withdrawing our deterrent capability while the North was under a hostile
                    communist dictatorship. But I felt the size and structure of that presence could
                    be discussed. When I first moved to the NSC, I was suspicious of our military's
                    drum-beat about its needs, and I thought their requirements were over-stated. I
                    would have considered some modest changes in the size and composition of our
                    forces in South Korea. But Carter's call for complete withdrawal of our ground
                    forces struck me as objectively dangerous as well as out of tune with public
                    sentiment. Most of us at the NSC didn't think it would ever fly. That may be the
                    reason I don't remember any analysis of it for President Ford.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>Around election time in 1976, Evelyn Colbert, at that time the National
                    Intelligence Officer for Northeast Asia, came to tell me about an on-going study
                    that indicated the North Korean order of battle was much larger than previously
                    thought. I was surprised, since I had assumed that even our old figures might be
                    somewhat overstated. But the new study was being done carefully, using the
                    latest photographic evidence. In any event, I wasn't qualified to dispute the
                    conclusions. It was a worrisome development. Evelyn left me a paper summarizing
                    the procedures used and the results of the intelligence community's work, which
                    I passed around to the appropriate people. Our intelligence agencies had been
                    aware of North Korea's greater deployments for as long as a year, because, with
                    the end of the war in Vietnam, they were finally able to deploy adequate numbers
                    of photographic interpreters to Korea. The actual buildup of North Korean forces
                    must have occurred some years earlier, although the concentration of forces near
                    the DMZ was perhaps more recent.</p>
                <p>Although the new intelligence came to us in stages, there was sufficient evidence
                    for concern by the fall of 1976. Initially, the new findings were circulated
                    mostly within intelligence channels and didn't get the attention they deserved.
                    General Stilwell in Seoul was properly briefed, and he ordered a higher state of
                    readiness for his forces, but it was not until the Carter Administration took
                    over that the findings became a source of contention among policy makers. The
                    wrangle began for me in March 1977 while we were struggling to get the
                    intelligence community to agree on an assessment to accompany PRM #13, the study
                    of the troop withdrawal issue. By the spring of 1978 successive briefings on
                    intelligence studies convinced me nothing except symbolic withdrawals could be
                    justified, and about a year later the case was so strong that President Carter
                    was forced put his plan on hold, pending a review to be held after the next
                    presidential election.</p>
                <p>Let me turn briefly to the PRC. During 1976, Mao Zedong died and was succeeded by
                    his designated successor, a little known regional official named Hua Guofeng.
                    Mao's widow, Jiang Qing, and her radical leftist colleagues seemed to be gaining
                    the upper hand. Deng Xiaoping was harassed and retreated for his life to the
                    south under the wing of Marshal Ye Jianying, a powerful and prestigious military
                    peer of Mao. A hard line seemed ascendant in China. Changes introduced by Zhou
                    En-lai and Deng were suffocated by leftist orthodoxy. In this atmosphere,
                    normalization of US-PRC relations went into a deep freeze. There were no
                    interesting meetings of US and Chinese officials. When Senator Hugh Scott
                    traveled to China and initiated a discussion of normalization, Zhang Chunqiao,
                    the tough communist ideologue from Shanghai, talked of forcibly liberating
                    Taiwan. This left-wing distraction didn't last long thanks to a sudden coup-like
                    strike by the PLA organized by Marshal Ye under the authority of Hua Guofeng.
                    The “gang of four” were arrested, tried, and jailed in a decisive shift in the
                    domestic balance of power that soon brought Deng back into the leadership.
                    Nevertheless, combined with President Ford's inhibitions, the turmoil within
                    China extinguished any thoughts of progress toward normalization before our
                    elections. While things were relatively quiet on the policy front, developments
                    in China remained, of course, a subject of intense high level interest.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>In general, Asian issues were surprisingly muted during the American election
                    process in 1976. I don't recall major anxieties or demands stemming from
                    election, for example, no effort to zero in on Carter's Korean pledge. The
                    closest linkage came from Southeast Asia issues. There were tricky refugee
                    problems which Quinn, having been close to the subject for sometime and enjoying
                    a good relation with Scowcroft, handled very well, mostly on his own with little
                    help from me. Quinn's work required close consultation with Congress as well as
                    various non-governmental organizations that worked in the refugee field.
                    Refugees were a politically sensitive matter, not so much in a partisan sense,
                    but from the importance many in Congress, commendably, attached to victims of
                    the war. The Vietnam war was not a campaign issue. Apparently, no one wanted to
                    open wounds in an enterprise that had been supported by both Democrats and
                    Republicans. Nevertheless, the bitter divide among Americans over the war made
                    us very careful in anything dealing with Vietnam or Cambodia.</p>
                <p>I was on the NSC essentially while it was marking time before the inauguration of
                    a president. It was not a stimulating experience, although I admired most of the
                    people for whom I worked and the people who worked for me. From the day Carter
                    won, we were dead in the water. The atmosphere was depressing, as grey as the
                    exterior of the Executive Office Building in which we worked.</p>
                <p>During a brief six months in the NSC I was not involved enough with President
                    Ford to develop any feel for his personal views. In fact, I had a better
                    understanding of where his administration wanted to go on China when I was in
                    the Department. However, my tour gave me some appreciation of how the making of
                    foreign policy looked from the perspective of the national security advisor. I
                    had quite a few conversations with Scowcroft during which he shared his views
                    quite candidly. I got a sense of how the State Department “sausage factory”
                    looked to others, and I observed the inter-agency battles with some detachment.
                    My sense of how the NSC functioned was somewhat skewed, since Secretary of State
                    Kissinger was so dominant in the administration.</p>
                <p>I was impressed with the NSC staff's ability to influence the president through
                    routine staff work. Almost all memoranda going to the president had to be
                    summarized and commented on to meet presidential requirements. This opened a
                    pandora's box of subjective influences from his staff members. Effectively, we
                    exercised a kind of censorship that made me somewhat uneasy. The NSC could be
                    used for good or for abuse; the direction was primarily determined by the
                    adviser. Scowcroft was superbly fair about this.</p>
                <p>We spent considerable time preparing elaborate briefing materials for the new
                    Democratic team and guessing who would be involved in the foreign policy
                    process. We heard about Vance and Brzezinski soon after the election, but the
                    levels under them were not known for sometime.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>In December, I learned that Brzezinski wanted to have the prominent young scholar
                    Michel Oksenberg as his China expert. Since China was the biggest chunk of my
                    job in the NSC, this news reinforced my feeling that I should pull out. After
                    Brzezinski moved in as part of the transition, I went to see him - we had met a
                    number of times while he was an academic. Without exhibiting any enthusiasm, he
                    asked me to stay on the NSC staff, which I declined on grounds there wasn't room
                    for two China experts. I then proceeded to extract myself and was replaced by
                    Mike Armacost.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In January 1977 you moved back to your old office at the
                        StatDepartment. How did this come about and what happened in EA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>GLEYSTEEN: Not long after my session with Brzezinski, Phil Habib called me to say
                    that Vance and he thought I would be a good candidate as the senior deputy to
                    Dick Holbrooke who had been designated as the new assistant secretary of State
                    for East Asian and Pacific Affairs. Phil failed to tell me that this was his
                    idea and that Holbrooke was determined to choose his own senior deputy. While
                    furious, Holbrooke, nevertheless, agreed to talk to me, and we met for lunch in
                    late December. I am sure Holbrooke, who didn't know me, thought of me as too old
                    (I was 50) and too conventional. I in turn remembered him as a bright, brash
                    young officer whom I had seen briefly in Vietnam in 1968 when accompanying Joe
                    Sisco on a visit. At the time, Dick was working for Bob Komer in the CORDS
                    headquarters in Saigon. Watching both of them wipe their eye glasses with their
                    shirt tails, I thought they sounded too gung-ho about their operation, but I
                    knew Dick was later involved with the peace talks and had left the Foreign
                    Service over Vietnam policy. In any event, the mind set on both sides of the
                    lunch table was not exactly auspicious.Even so, Dick and I managed to be open
                    minded about each other, and by the end of a long lunch it seemed to me that we
                    might hit it off as a useful match. Dick was disarmed by my relaxed answer when
                    he asked me how I would feel working for someone 15 years younger, and he came
                    across to me as a capable, bright high flyer with obvious political savvy who
                    seemed to be on the right track when it came to issues close to my heart. In
                    particular I wanted to know whether he was interested in pursuing normalization
                    with the PRC, which he was. We also discussed the Korea troop withdrawal issue.
                    He denied being the author of Carter's scheme, and we agreed it would be a very
                    bad move. We assumed Carter would be forced to drop or modify it once he was in
                    office - a very bad prediction from both of us. Not long after the lunch Dick
                    invited me to become his senior deputy. Thus began an unlikely but successful
                    collaboration.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>In early January, before inauguration, Dick arranged for us to see Vance, whom I
                    had gotten to know superficially at a variety of long weekend conferences on
                    foreign policy chaired by Harriman. We focused on China, which we discussed at
                    length, and we also talked about Korea, particularly about troop withdrawal.
                    Vance and Holbrooke sought my perspective both as a specialist and person
                    familiar with recent dealings. I felt comfortable with discussion; Vance was
                    very positive about moving promptly to normalize relations with China, and he
                    agreed that Carter's plans on troop withdrawal could not go ahead without
                    careful advance study of the consequences in Korea and East Asia generally.</p>
                <p>Apart from this kind of policy review on all important issues, Dick and I spent
                    much of initial time on management issues, including of course staffing
                    problems. I was to be the senior deputy with responsibility for Northeast Asia.
                    Dick also wanted me to free him as much as possible on the management side so he
                    could be in the front trenches of policy making - in the State Department, White
                    House, and Congress, and with the public. And that is the way it turned out. He
                    consulted me on every personnel change he wanted to make in the bureau as well
                    as ambassadorial and other senior assignments. He brought me into that process
                    completely; I don't think there was ever an exception.Holbrooke made a lot of
                    changes in the bureau, some of which were not well received by the career
                    Foreign Service, including me. He was compulsive about starting with a clean
                    slate, assuming incumbents had been tainted, or would be seen as tainted, by the
                    Kissinger years, whereas I was convinced that most of us had played useful
                    roles, for example, on China, Korea, and even Vietnam. Dick's urge to change
                    seemed to be his own reading of how the political winds were blowing, the need
                    for a fresh look and cleaning out the remnants of the Vietnam era. I didn't
                    sense that Vance felt the same way, and I argued the merits of continuity. As a
                    practical matter there were relatively few changes in Northeast Asia and quite a
                    few in Southeast Asia - more than usual in transitions but not enough to call a
                    purge.</p>
                <p>Among the officers who suffered the most from Holbrooke's sweep was Art Hummel,
                    the outgoing assistant secretary, who felt insulted and said so. The changes
                    were an implied criticism of his leadership; he was never given a chance to
                    brief Dick on what had happened on his watch; there was no send-off for a highly
                    regarded career officer; and if he had a message for Holbrooke, it had to go
                    through me. Holbrooke shunned Hummel, putting me between a new boss and a friend
                    whom I had long admired. I didn't like it, and I said so. Fortunately, Habib and
                    others treated Hummel better, and he got a good assignment as ambassador to
                    Pakistan.</p>
                <p>My colleagues as deputies were Bob Oakley for Southeast Asia and, after some
                    time, Evelyn Colbert for the rest of the area. Erland Heginbotham was the deputy
                    for economic affairs. He had a personal relationship of some kind with Dick, who
                    liked his questioning attitude and econometric ideas about how we should deal
                    with a dynamic region. We were often on opposite sides of an argument; e.g. his
                    idea that we should concentrate our aid on Burma, because, statistically, it
                    would be most efficient use of limited our resources.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>A major focus for me was the production of policy papers and memoranda by the
                    bureau for the secretary or one of his senior staff. Although I did some
                    drafting at the beginning, I quickly learned to delegate most of the work to the
                    desks headed by Harry Thayer for China and Bob Rich for Korea. For the China
                    papers, Thayer in turn assembled some extremely talented staff members,
                    including Alan Romberg from S/P and Stapleton Roy from the desk. Working
                    directly with the drafting officers, I supervised the design and review phases
                    of the paper writing. I was proud of the product in most cases, although we had
                    our share of monstrosities.</p>
                <p>By far the most important papers in the first few months of Vance's leadership
                    were on China and Korea. All we had tried to do on China while I was in the NSC
                    was to ride out the political storm in the PRC and await our own presidential
                    election. By the end of the 1976 there more and more indications that Deng
                    Xiaoping was returning to power presumably with the policies he had espoused
                    before his downfall, and with a new president, we were finally hopeful we could
                    soon move ahead with a major effort toward full normalization of relations. Yet
                    there was still much doubt. For all the rhetoric about wanting progress on
                    China, I was far from sure that Carter was really going to move. The 1976
                    election was not a referendum on our China policy; China was not even an
                    election issue.</p>
                <p>In our first meeting I made clear to Vance and Holbrooke that I had long favored
                    normalization. Acknowledging that China had been very difficult in 1976, I
                    suggested there was again hope for progress if Deng continued his climb back to
                    power. I urged that we test the waters in a systematic way to see whether there
                    was any reciprocal interest in the PRC. The crunch problem was Taiwan, which
                    obviously had to be handled with great care. I remember putting very heavy
                    stress on two points. One was my personal view that Taiwan would definitely
                    survive the strain of de-recognition. Its economic progress and easing political
                    constraints would provide a helpful buffer. The second was my conviction that we
                    would do better with both the Chinese and Soviets if we “played it straight,”
                    letting each know that we were dealing with the other because of common
                    interests and acknowledging to both we had important disagreements with both. In
                    effect, I questioned the benefit to us of Kissinger's implicit tilt toward
                    China. Vance seemed positive on all these points, perhaps overly so regarding
                    the second one. In the name of an even hand, I later discovered, he at least
                    subconsciously rated arms control issues with the USSR more important than
                    moving briskly on normalization.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>Since Vance, Brzezinski, and many others have discussed how the Carter
                    Administration went about normalization, I will limit my comments mostly to main
                    impressions. Vance had us prepare a memorandum from him to the President arguing
                    the case for moving ahead with the PRC. In an effort to engender State/NSC
                    collaboration we brought Oksenberg fully into the process, even though we
                    assumed he was privately doing something parallel for Brzezinski. As part of the
                    effort we reviewed the quite complete files that Kissinger had left us. They
                    were kept in my office after being turned over to us by Winston Lord. Oksenberg,
                    completely new to this material, was the most eager reader. Of course, the files
                    contained vital information, including the pledges made by Nixon, Kissinger, and
                    Ford, but not the bombshells suspected by some of the new people. The record
                    showed clearly why the PRC had reacted negatively to some of our policies. The
                    Chinese felt that they had been led down a garden path on prompt normalization
                    and resented it.</p>
                <p>I thought we did well by Vance, producing a document for the president making the
                    case for normalization in terms that I found more accurate and persuasive than
                    some of the rhetoric from the Nixon period. None of us knew Carter's real
                    intentions. He had spoken publicly in favor of normalization - almost every one
                    had, and he had privately told Vance he was serious about moving ahead. In any
                    event, after reading the paper, the president convened a meeting in the spring
                    of 1977 that was attended by Vance, Habib, Holbrooke and me from the Department,
                    Brzezinski and Oksenberg from the NSC, and, I believe, Harold Brown. Carter gave
                    us a little homily about normalization and his support for it. I was then
                    excused while the others remained to discuss modalities. I still wasn't sure
                    that Carter was determined to push forward, but I was glad that he spoke as he
                    had.As a result of this session we were charged with producing a paper, PRM 24,
                    on the specifics of normalization. Vance's interest in the China issue was then
                    at its height. Preparation of this blueprint was time consuming. The paper was
                    very thorough and covered all the issues. Like the earlier paper, it reflected
                    the view that our China policy should not be governed simply by anti-Soviet
                    considerations, but by a more comprehensive view of strategic interests,
                    including, of course, our need to counter the Soviet threat. Vance soon became a
                    missionary for this argument, which suited him as he negotiated SALT and other
                    issues with the Soviets. The paper also reflected my concern to minimize the
                    damage to Taiwan that would be the price of normalization. This led to some
                    controversy later. At the outset, every one agreed that we had to be careful
                    about Taiwan, since we had a lot at stake there and would have the world
                    watching to see how we dealt with an ally. I probably had the most intense
                    feeling about this issue, being the only one of us to have served in Taiwan, but
                    I didn't find much quarrel with my position. I was certain Vance would not be a
                    party to any deal undermining Taiwan.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>PRM 24 was completed some time in June 1977. Again, I was not included in the
                    deliberations with the President that resulted in the decision to send Secretary
                    Vance to Beijing in August 1977. The accounts in Vance's and Brzezinski's
                    memoirs more or less confirm what I remember being told at the time: Carter's
                    commitment to pursue normalization was clear, but not the priority he would
                    accord it. Vance wanted to get the Panama issue out of the way before facing the
                    Congress with the consequences for Taiwan of normalization with the PRC. He also
                    wanted parallel progress on Soviet issues. Thus, although he was determined to
                    get started, he was in not in a great hurry to complete the process. At this
                    early stage Brzezinski favored pushing ahead with normalization, but given his
                    concern about the Soviets, he was even more interested in reaffirming and
                    underscoring the tilt toward China symbolized by the Shanghai Communique - as
                    was Secretary Brown. Faced with this complex of concerns, President Carter
                    declared himself resolved to carry through with normalization, and he approved a
                    draft communique to this effect that Vance could use if he achieved enough
                    progress in Beijing. At the same time, however, Carter opted for a negotiating
                    tactic that flawed the Vance mission to China.</p>
                <p>Based in part on the results of extensive consultation with Congress, much of it
                    conducted by Holbrooke, the President decided for domestic political reasons
                    that we should try to get Chinese acceptance of a recognition formula that would
                    improve on the Japanese model, allowing us to retain an unofficial US
                    governmental presence on Taiwan in the form of a consulate or liaison mission.
                    We were to argue with the PRC that a governmental but unofficial presence of
                    some kind in Taiwan was a practical necessity for us because of our extensive
                    involvement in Taiwan, and that this presence would in no way constitute
                    continuing diplomatic recognition of the Taiwan regime. If the Chinese rejected
                    this scheme, it was my clear understanding that we would then fall back to the
                    Japanese formula of no governmental representation. As I recall, I favored
                    authority to retreat quickly to the Japanese formula, since I had personally
                    witnessed Deng Xiaoping slap down Kissinger's effort to do virtually the same
                    thing in 1974. Nevertheless, having accompanied Holbrooke on most of his
                    consultations on the Hill, I more or less accepted the domestic political
                    rationale of trying to improve on the Japanese formula to ease widespread
                    anxiety about switching recognition from the ROC to the PRC. Whatever may have
                    been said later in self justification, none of us at the time - specifically
                    including Brzezinski and Oksenberg — saw the tactic as a deal breaker so long as
                    we handled it carefully. Unfortunately, circumstances during and immediately
                    after the Vance trip made it appear that Vance had naively sought a better deal
                    for Taiwan than we could have realistically expected, causing a major setback in
                    the normalization process.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>In his first meeting in Beijing with Foreign Minister Huang Hua, Secretary Vance
                    made a very systematic presentation of our position, including the points about
                    a governmental presence on Taiwan, peaceful resolution of the unification issue,
                    and limited defensive arms transfers to Taiwan. Hua's response the next day was
                    negative, and during a subsequent session Deng characterized Vance's position as
                    a retreat from the Shanghai communique. Although Vance stressed that his
                    proposals were a starting point for discussion, he did not offer any immediate
                    sign of flexibility. The Chinese, whose appetites had been whetted by the Carter
                    Administration's rhetoric and reaffirmation of Nixon policy, were clearly
                    disappointed. Yet this was hardly the first time they had faced tough American
                    negotiators, and they displayed no hostility. The Chinese treated us in the same
                    normally friendly fashion they accorded to important U.S. visitors. For our
                    part, we were quite aware that if we wanted to succeed we would have to yield on
                    the representation issue, and we left Beijing feeling that we had begun a
                    dialogue on a very difficult process. This was the tone of the very objective
                    report we sent back to the White House.</p>
                <p>As we were leaving our Tokyo stopover on our way back to Washington, you can
                    imagine how stunned we were to learn that a Hearst correspondent (Wallach)
                    claimed that members of the NSC told him they saw “progress” in Vance's
                    discussions in Beijing, quite at odds with what Vance had actually reported.
                    Regardless of who said what to whom in Washington press circles, this story,
                    which made us look like fools or deceptive manipulators of the press, infuriated
                    the Chinese who issued a prompt denial. Some days later Deng himself publicly
                    characterized the Vance position as a setback to progress.</p>
                <p>As one of the drafters of Vance's report to the White House, I shared Vance's
                    anger over this Washington interpretation - so much so that I half convinced
                    myself that Brzezinski must have been the source and deliberately set Vance up
                    for a fall. Although this was probably unfair of me, it was symptomatic of the
                    uncomfortable relationship that had already developed by this time between the
                    NSC and ourselves. In any event, based on my observation of many previous
                    conversations with Chinese leaders, I thought Vance was competent in his
                    presentation of our initial position on normalization. Even though he was not as
                    polished or as free wheeling as Kissinger, he also conveyed clearly that the
                    administration was adopting a sophisticated mixture firmness and flexibility to
                    deal with the Soviet threat. To be sure, the Chinese were not thrilled to learn
                    of a U.S. view that placed the PRC as only one of several special American
                    concerns. Vance made that point quite skillfully, and it was an important
                    message for the PRC to hear. My main criticism of Vance's performance was his
                    failure to signal more clearly that we were prepared to compromise regarding our
                    future presence in Taiwan, but even so, I assumed the Chinese knew we would
                    eventually retreat. In short, I fully expected another round of talks and some
                    progress toward compromise. And this might have occurred sooner if the U.S.
                    Government had been able to keep its big mouth shut.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>Our first move on the normalization chess board was clumsy. The bar for the
                    Taiwan jump was set unrealistically high; we underestimated the damage of
                    overloading the administration's first negotiating contact with Deng; and in
                    striking contrast to Kissinger, we screwed up in briefing our own press.
                    Obviously there was no collusion between Deng and Brzezinski, but each for his
                    own reasons decided to categorize the Vance trip as a “failure.” This somewhat
                    unfair judgment prevails today.</p>
                <p>The unhappy outcome of the Vance visit to China did not smother expectations for
                    progress on the China front, and we continued busying ourselves with our growing
                    contacts with the PRC, holding Taiwan's hand, and conducting studies about
                    various aspects of normalization. Among these I have already mentioned the very
                    careful examination we made of arms transfers to Taiwan, trying to determine the
                    kinds of defensive weapons Taiwan needed to maintain a “credible deterrent”
                    against a PRC attack, which is those days was not a great danger. Although there
                    was some effort on the part of our military to provide Taiwan with unnecessary
                    items, the study for the most part was an objective one and served as a
                    guideline for our behavior even before normalization. Another important study
                    was the legal aspect of abrogating or renouncing the security treaty with the
                    ROC. This was a complicated matter of special interest to Secretary Vance, and
                    it was not completed before I left the scene to go to Korea.</p>
                <p>By the spring of 1978, it was apparent that Soviet policy had taken an aggressive
                    turn in many parts of the world - i.e. the Horn of Africa, Angola, Afghanistan,
                    etc.. Our new friends in China and Americans such as Brzezinski were quick to
                    recognize and perhaps exaggerate this, but many others without such a pronounced
                    animus against the Russians also sensed the hard line and saw the need for
                    somewhat tougher policies. Vested interests burst into action - variously
                    favoring a big buildup in defense, a tough line across the board with the
                    Soviets, playing the China card in new games, etc.. Vance - and even more the
                    President - seemed slow in facing up to this phase of Soviet policy, partly
                    perhaps because they were so committed to a more hopeful prognosis about detente
                    with the USSR. Of course, both men eventually accepted the facts. Carter swung
                    around quite far toward Brzezinski's position. While not sharing Carter's
                    previous naivete about the USSR, Vance also had to toughen his position. Yet he
                    seemed distinctly reluctant and clearly uncomfortable with the tactics of
                    flamboyant confrontation and games playing that were so elemental in
                    Brzezinski's style.</p>
                <p>Whatever the reason, Vance appeared a bit soft in confronting the new twist in
                    Soviet behavior, and this worked in Brzezinski's favor. Even though Vance had
                    far more prestige and clout in the Administration and Congress, Brzezinski's
                    posture was more appealing and popular in the Cold War atmosphere of the time.
                    He denounced the Russians and simplified the world into a black and white
                    picture of zero-sum games. He wouldn't, for example, mention Vietnam without
                    adding the prefix “Soviet proxy.”</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>Vance and Brzezinski didn't have major differences over normalization with China,
                    but their differing approaches did affect the debate about many other aspects of
                    our dealings with China. In the struggle I felt Vance did not exert himself when
                    he should have, and I winced as Brzezinski took advantage of this and sought to
                    emulate Kissinger in his NSC days. He began to invite the PRC ambassador to his
                    office for chats - without telling the secretary of State. He maneuvered the
                    president into making important decisions without Vance's participation. It had
                    become obvious to many that the secretary of State and the NSC advisor did not
                    get along. They were very unlike and saw the world through different prisms.This
                    high level friction accumulated to become a serious impediment to objective
                    treatment of important questions, such as security relations with the PRC, the
                    conduct of Brzezinski's visit to China, and relations with Vietnam. In dealing
                    with these matters I usually found myself in the middle, but nearer to Vance's
                    side. On the security issue, Brzezinski wanted to flaunt our China card in front
                    of the Russians, using various devices to underscore our potential for altering
                    the strategic balance between the Russians and Chinese. Effectively, he favored
                    an explicit tilt toward the PRC, symbolized by a visit of the secretary of
                    Defense to China (fortunately delayed until after normalization), close
                    intelligence cooperation, military contacts, relaxed controls on dual-use
                    technology, tolerance of allied military sales, and possibly even military
                    assistance in limited areas of defense. Brzezinski calculated that the Soviets
                    could be bullied this way into a more cooperative posture, while Vance worried
                    that some of these actions would only antagonize the Russians, stimulating the
                    arms race and damaging prospects for detente in addition to worrying many of our
                    allies. From my less exalted level, I shared Vance's concerns, but I felt we
                    should energetically counter Soviet behavior - mostly by ensuring our own
                    military superiority and trying promptly to normalize our relations with the
                    PRC. Both of these sober actions would convey the right strategic message to the
                    Soviets without the cost the explicit tilt in security.</p>
                <p>As I noted earlier I did not object to some forms of military and intelligence
                    cooperation with China, but I was strongly, outspokenly opposed to military
                    assistance to the PRC. My problems began in the previous administration with our
                    approval of British military sales, but in this earlier period the limited
                    measures proposed were conceived as compromises with our allies and China, not
                    pieces of a grand scheme to encircle the Soviet empire. Initially I thought
                    Brzezinski was going to continue Kissinger's cautious approach, but in early
                    1978 Mike Oksenberg began trying out ideas on me that I found alarming.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>Reflecting his boss, Oksenberg talked not only of our interest in a “stable,
                    prosperous, and friendly” China but also a “strong” China, and he acknowledged
                    that this might mean possible military assistance to China by our allies or even
                    ourselves. Apart from the questionable effect on Soviet policy, I argued that
                    China's Asian neighbors would be appalled by such action, which would also make
                    Taiwan's defense more complicated. But even more important, the concept failed
                    to take account of the prospect that at some future point US and PRC interest
                    might well clash. This consideration seems pedestrian in today's climate, but in
                    those days the intellectual infection of US-PRC military collaboration spread
                    from NSC whizz kids to significant numbers of sensible people in the defense
                    community as well as less sensible persons with various axes to grind.</p>
                <p>My recollection is that Vance and I were among the most cautious on security
                    assistance to the PRC, and as a practical matter during Vance's tenure military
                    activities with China were minimized. Later, several foolish decisions were made
                    by the Carter and Reagan administrations, particularly help to the Chinese with
                    the avionics for their F-8 fighter bomber. To put it bluntly: Brzezinski was an
                    ignoramus on East Asia in general; Oksenberg was very savvy about China but not
                    about its neighbors; and neither man paid enough attention to their colleague,
                    Mike Armacost, who was both very expert on East Asia and to our own
                    bureaucracy.</p>
                <p>Although I was only briefly and peripherally involved, policy toward Vietnam was
                    another example of how antagonism between State and the NSC complicated an
                    already complicated situation. Like President Ford, President Carter did not
                    feel legally bound by the Kissinger era agreement to aid Vietnam in the post-war
                    period. Vietnamese failure to comply with key provisions of the Paris settlement
                    provided ample grounds to refuse, and Americans generally were lukewarm or
                    opposed to relations with such a recent enemy. However, both the President and
                    Vance as well as a bi-partisan minority in Congress favored normalization of
                    relations with Vietnam and gave the issue considerable priority. I am not sure
                    why. Perhaps it reflected the need for expiation among some who served in the
                    new administration. In any event Leonard Woodcock, former president of the UAW
                    and later Ambassador to China, was promptly dispatched to Vietnam on a fact
                    finding mission, and his favorable report was the trigger for an effort toward
                    normalization that was to last twenty years.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>While I had no burning sense of sin about our actions in the war, I too favored a
                    rapprochement with Vietnam. Partly this was my standard reaction of wanting to
                    deal with all significant governments that were effectively in power; partly it
                    was a feeling that it would be smart to try to encourage Vietnam away from its
                    steadily increasing dependence on the Soviet Union. Treating Vietnam as a pariah
                    and Soviet proxy in the style of Brzezinski struck me as satisfying Chinese, not
                    US national interests. To be sure, if I had been forced to choose, I would have
                    given priority to moving ahead with China. Although Vance and Holbrooke shared
                    these opinions and pushed negotiations with Vietnam near to success, ultimately
                    they were unable to prevent the issue from being mired down in an ideological
                    debate and questionable reasoning on our part. Brzezinski won the battle over
                    whether we could risk normalizing with Vietnam in the midst of trying to do the
                    same with the PRC. Effectively, we pulled back and halted the process with
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Vietnam's invasion of Cambodia obscured the error of our ways. While this crude
                    Vietnamese action took place after I moved on to Seoul, I was still in
                    Washington while the bloody Khmer Rouge took over Cambodia and began their
                    aggressive border incursions against Vietnam. If the Vietnamese in response had
                    limited themselves to punishing counterstrikes, history might have taken quite a
                    different turn, but when they went on to occupy most of the country and
                    establish an alternative government under Hun Sen, they blighted prospects for
                    an early opening to the non-communist world. We adopted hostile policies that
                    helped push Vietnam further and further into the Soviet camp. In late 1978,
                    early 1979, I was amazed to learn in Seoul that Brzezinski had given the Chinese
                    a virtual green light to “teach a lesson” to the Vietnamese by a limited
                    military strike and again later when we joined the Chinese and some ASEAN
                    countries in a loose cooperation with the Khmer Rouge against the Vietnamese and
                    Hun Sen. Perhaps if I had held some responsibility in Washington, I might have
                    felt differently, but I doubt it. After my retirement I spent many hours over
                    many years arguing with former colleagues for a more sensible policy toward
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>The third issue I want to mention was the most unpleasant for me and my
                    colleagues in the State Department, namely the NSC's preemption of the core
                    negotiations with the PRC on normalization. As it became increasingly
                    transparent that Vance and Brzezinski were vying with each other for
                    presidential support and control of strategy toward the USSR, PRC officials
                    began to play games with us, as they had done before. Sensing that Brzezinski
                    was eager to put US-PRC cooperation high on the US policy agenda as an
                    anti-Soviet strategy, they welcomed a dialogue with him beginning in the fall of
                    1977. Through Oksenberg, Holbrooke and I were more or less aware of the NSC
                    advisor's contacts with the Chinese, but we were never consulted. In his memoirs
                    Brzezinski claimed that “Holbrooke and his State Department colleagues looked
                    increasingly to the White House for leadership,” because Vance was preoccupied
                    with other matters. This is a shameless distortion of the facts: Brzezinski knew
                    damn well that Holbrooke and I were struggling to prevent him from usurping what
                    we believed to be the State Department's proper function. Anyway, Brzezinski had
                    no trouble soliciting a Chinese invitation to visit Beijing, which was
                    publicized along with Brzezinski's courteous acceptance in November, triggering
                    a fight with Vance, Habib, and Holbrooke, who recognized it as a power play and
                    immediately opposed it. During the next few months Brzezinski used his proximity
                    to his boss to lobby Carter into approval of a visit, while Vance struggled to
                    head him off or instead to have Vice President Mondale be the emissary to China.
                    Brzezinski won the battle in March, reflecting a major set back in Vance's
                    standing with Carter.</p>
                <p>Under presidential instructions, we began preparations for a Brzezinski trip to
                    China. This time the process was centered in the NSC with only the minimum
                    necessary help from the State Department - and sometimes not even that. The
                    formal decision making process was relatively proper. Whatever reservations
                    Vance may have had regarding complications in his dealings with the Soviets, the
                    State Department strongly supported a major push by Brzezinski toward
                    normalization, and we were delighted when the president instructed Brzezinski to
                    tell the Chinese that “the United States has made up its mind.” Thus Brzezinski
                    was authorized to agree to the Japanese formula of no U.S. governmental presence
                    in Taiwan, although on security matters he was still instructed to stress our
                    insistence on a peaceful resolution of the Taiwan problem and our intention to
                    provide defensive arms to the island. These terms constituted our best shot to
                    achieve success on an acceptable basis, and we all supported them without
                    qualification. Speaking for myself, I also had little trouble with the way
                    Brzezinski planned to underscore the vigor of our response to expansionist
                    Soviet policies, even though I was openly unenthusiastic about his plan to take
                    along a number of senior advisors to be publicly cozy with Chinese counterparts
                    on matters of strategy, military intelligence, science and technology, and
                    economics.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>Despite this substantial consensus about the national security advisor's
                    instructions for Beijing, the NSC had effectively cut State out of the policy
                    development process. Essentially, Brzezinski and Oksenberg developed positions
                    secretly, obtained the President's concurrence, and then presented them to Vance
                    and us as a fait accompli. I suspect the NSC had some pangs of conscience about
                    deflecting the bureaucracy from giving them the benefit of its judgment, because
                    Oksenberg got permission employ a CIA analyst as a secret advisor. The person he
                    selected was a good friend of mine - feisty and imaginative, but not someone I
                    would rely on for balanced opinions.</p>
                <p>To some extent my role also breached the NSC's iron curtain around preparations.
                    Although I was kept well away from the inner deliberative process within the
                    White House, Brzezinski and Oksenberg needed someone such as me to vet key
                    papers and critique their ideas. Very transparently, they also enjoyed using me
                    as a semi-legitimate way of cutting out Holbrooke - and infuriating him. Despite
                    my resentment, I in turn felt it was my duty as a senior career officer to try
                    to insinuate State Department views in ways that would make the visit as
                    successful as possible. On many occasions I was asked by Oksenberg for comments
                    about papers, but I was never allowed to keep a copy, and I was always enjoined
                    “not to tell Holbrooke.” While always taking advantage of the opportunity to
                    comment, I made clear that I strongly disapproved of our not being given copies
                    and would keep Holbrooke informed. Each time I immediately reported back to
                    Holbrooke who always hit the ceiling. However, sore as he was over this
                    manipulative abuse, Holbrooke to his credit never tried to stop me from my
                    rather truculent cooperation with the NSC.</p>
                <p>As the time approached for Brzezinski's visit in May 1978 our problems became
                    even more excruciating. The State Department had to fight to get Holbrooke and
                    me onto Brzezinski's delegation as the State Department contingent. On the plane
                    Oksenberg conspiratorially pulled me aside to ask me to review Brzezinski's
                    talking points, which I did with Brzezinski himself, and I insisted they be
                    shown to Dick. Initially they were not and other papers were treated the same
                    way - to the point that I refused any further cooperation. Holbrooke was finally
                    shown the papers.</p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>Matters did not improve after we arrived in Beijing. To note the positive first,
                    Brzezinski was able to achieve the beginnings of a breakthrough on normalization
                    - as Vance conceivably might have a year earlier if he had the same
                    instructions. Morever, with the exception of some childish anti-Soviet pranks in
                    public, Brzezinski conducted himself skillfully. On normalization, he
                    effectively conveyed Carter's readiness to move promptly, resolved the issue of
                    unofficial US representation on Taiwan without much trouble, made very clear to
                    Deng that we did not want to be contradicted in our public insistence that the
                    Taiwan issue be resolved peacefully, and signaled indirectly that we would need
                    to provide limited defensive arms to Taiwan during a historical transition
                    period. Deng's failure to denounce this latter point as a violation of the
                    Shanghai Communique, etc. struck me as a possible break through, and I
                    immediately said so to Brzezinski when I read the transcript of the session.
                    Although I was less impressed by Brzezinski's customary anti-Soviet rhetoric, I
                    liked his robust defense of our policy toward the USSR and his asking Deng to
                    stop publicly berating us when we had enforced the balance of power so
                    effectively for so many years. I felt this pugnacious point was a considerable
                    improvement over Kissinger's normal response.</p>
                <p>In other respects, however, Brzezinski's behavior was outrageous, particularly
                    his delight in humiliating Holbrooke and the State Department both in private
                    and public - behavior that would have been unimaginable for his Chinese hosts,
                    who of course took careful note of this gratuitous advertisement of strains
                    within the American camp. Although I seriously fault Holbrooke for his part in
                    this battle of egos, Brzezinski was the instigator, and to this day I consider
                    his conduct a national disgrace.</p>
                <p>Holbrooke and I were included in the lower level meetings in Beijing as well as
                    the brief greeting sessions with Deng Xiaoping and Hua Guofeng, but we were
                    ostentatiously excluded from the key meetings with these leaders, a very clear
                    break in our practice since 1973. Given my blunt, almost violent argument with
                    him about the importance of having State Department representation at these
                    sessions, I was naturally angered to read a few years later in Brzezinski's
                    memoirs that “other members of the delegation accepted this restriction, except
                    for Holbrooke, who made a great issue of personal privilege out of his
                    exclusion.” On the plane on the way home, resentments boiled over. Once again I,
                    but not Holbrooke, had been allowed to read the memoranda of conversation, and
                    once again I had demanded they be shown to Holbrooke. They eventually were but
                    not before a disgusting shouting match among all of us and the threat of a
                    school yard physical battle between Holbrooke and Oksenberg. It was awful,
                    probably the nadir of my bureaucratic experience.</p>

                <p>Despite the clash of two powerful egos, I never fully understood why two very
                    intelligent people behaved as Brzezinski and Holbrooke did. It may not have done
                    much serious damage to US foreign policy, but it certainly didn't help the
                    cause. To show how personal it was, I might note that I am fairly sure that if
                    the NSC could have invited me to attend those meetings without Holbrooke, they
                    would have done so. It didn't help matters that Ambassador Woodcock was included
                    in all of the meetings with Chinese leaders, because he was playing along with
                    Brzezinski; getting his instructions from the NSC, not the State Department.
                    Fortunately, records of all the meetings became available to us, and I always
                    felt that they accurately reflected what had happened. I am not sure that I
                    would have had the same confidence in Nixon's NSC apparatus.</p>
                <p>The net effect of this strain within the administration, when added to the hard
                    line taken by the Soviets and our own tough reaction to it, was to take us back
                    toward the simplistic bipolar world where the line was “let's be good to the PRC
                    as a way of putting pressure on the Soviet Union.” This suited the Chinese,
                    because it gave them leverage in their dealings with us. Furthermore, we had a
                    secretary of State in these circumstances who was sensible, judicious, and a
                    real gentleman, but not very adept in the ugly kind of infighting that took
                    place under our Christian leader, Jimmy Carter. After the struggle, the NSC
                    became the real manager of our relations with the PRC, even though most of the
                    expertise was in the Department of State. I thought it was a risky way to
                    conduct policy.</p>
                <p>After the end of the Brzezinski trip, I wrote him a memorandum, giving him my
                    evaluation of the visit and criticizing our treatment. At the time I felt I was
                    being pretty hard on him, but on re-reading the memo a few years ago, I found it
                    too polite. I did compliment him on the outcome of the Taiwan discussion with
                    Deng, stating the visit was more successful than I had anticipated. Of course, I
                    gave Vance and Holbrooke copies of my memorandum.</p>
                <p>All this happened in the last few months of my tour in Washington. Just before
                    leaving for Korea, I also wrote a long polite memorandum to Vance that
                    temporarily strained our relationship. As objectively as I could, I discussed
                    where we stood with the PRC - the pluses and the minuses. I praised his role in
                    the development of our policy towards the PRC; pointed out that the Brzezinski
                    visit might well prove to be the breakthrough for us; criticized the way we were
                    being pushed around by the NSC; and urged that Vance insert himself back in
                    firmly with the President. In my memorandum I asked for an appointment, which he
                    granted. We had a very frank private conversation during which I re-emphasized
                    the need for him to take firm hold of the reins of foreign policy. Of course, I
                    was being presumptuous. I was emboldened to do what I did by the power of my
                    feelings, and I am sure Vance got the same advice from many others. He listened
                    to me in obvious pain, made no comment, and changed the subject.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>Finally on the PRC, I have two thoughts. First, I thought then and still believe
                    today that our policy toward China was essentially balanced. During the first
                    phase of our rapprochement with China, I felt we could have done better by
                    Taiwan, but by the time of the Carter Administration I was convinced we were
                    doing everything possible for Taiwan short of calling a halt to the entire
                    process with the PRC. I definitely favored going ahead on the terms set out
                    during the Brzezinski visit, and I am convinced the ambiguity of the agreement
                    with the PRC concerning Taiwan security was the best we could do. In other
                    words, I have no apologies.</p>
                <p>Second, far less important and somewhat contradictory to what I have just said, I
                    feel we might have done slightly better by Congress and Taiwan in the very final
                    phase. Despite the dangers, it was a mistake not to keep the Congress better
                    informed. The backlash was Congress's revision of the Taiwan Relations Act in
                    ways that significantly reduced our flexibility. Similarly, Taiwan deserved more
                    notice than it was given, and I suspect we could have adopted slightly more
                    favorable arrangements for practical contact with Taiwan, obviating some of our
                    later troubles with visitors from Taiwan. We might have been able to get away
                    with the practices of Singapore and other Southeast Asian countries. Be that as
                    it may, when Christopher went to Taipei to work out the final arrangements for
                    the future, the Taiwanese really took after him - they were very nasty. I
                    understood their ire, and, if I had been a Taiwanese, I would probably have done
                    the same. I am not suggesting that the outcome would necessarily have been
                    better if I had remained in the DAS position in Washington, but I think I would
                    have opposed some of the self-depriving provisions that were finally adopted by
                    persons less sensitive to Taiwan than I.</p>
                <p>Now let me turn to Korea. I would like to add a few more details about troop
                    withdrawals to the account contained in my book published by Brookings. I found
                    Phil Habib, by this time the under secretary for political affairs and the most
                    senior foreign service officer, somewhat more ambivalent about Carter's troop
                    withdrawal proposal than I. Both of us were opposed to troop withdrawals in the
                    radical terms postulated by Governor Carter during the election campaign, but
                    Phil seemed more inclined towards an “arm's length” relationship with the ROK
                    than I was. Of course, he had long experience with Korean matters - including
                    service in Korea just after Park's coup in 1961 and again when Park promulgated
                    the Yushin Constitution in 1972. Like me in later years, these events forced him
                    to wrestle with the moral issue of maintaining our military presence in the face
                    of political retrogression in Korea. In 1972, he considered doing something with
                    our forces to distance us from Park, although the nearest he came to any
                    practical recommendation was to sign off on messages from his political section
                    that talked of basing of the 2nd Division further to the south and removing US
                    forces from the Panmunjom area. These recommendations didn't make sense to me at
                    the time or later.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>After Carter tried to bully the bureaucracy into implementing his withdrawal
                    plans in 1977, I occasionally wondered why Phil didn't exploit his great
                    prestige to tell Vance that if Carter persisted with his Korea policy, he would
                    need to find another under secretary. The most obvious instance was the day we
                    received instructions from the White House through Vance and Phil not to
                    consider the wisdom of Carter plans, only the modalities for carrying it out.
                    This diktat violated a most basic concept about policy making in our country.
                    Someone should have challenged the White House, but Vance and Habib were team
                    players, not Singlaub. So, I must admit, was I. Perhaps the unheroic tactics we
                    chose were the best way to handle Carter.</p>
                <p>The issue of troop withdrawals attracted all sorts of attention. Military opinion
                    ranged from views similar to mine - major withdrawals “never,” but consideration
                    of small withdrawals “maybe” - to Jack Singlaub, who was speaking for the
                    majority in the military. On the civilian side, there were a few people who were
                    fervent supporters of the president - although most would not have gone as far
                    he did on this issue - to those who were strongly opposed to any change in the
                    status quo. When these various factions were brought together in meetings, there
                    couldn't be a meeting of minds; instead, there was a kind of paralysis.</p>
                <p>Producing an acceptable intelligence annex for NSM 13, the bureaucracy's study of
                    the issue, was probably the messiest process in which I ever participated. What
                    was the balance of power between South and North Korea? We argued endlessly in
                    search of an accurate formulation, but the result was fuzzy and the process was
                    exasperating. To be sure, intelligence assessments are cumbersome affairs. Many
                    agencies and many parts of agencies are involved; by the time the assessment is
                    completed, everyone is worn out and tends to sign off on a draft that fuzzes
                    over differences; the process takes forever; and if there is an externally
                    dictated time limitation - as there was with the troop withdrawal issue, the
                    process is more strained than usual. In this instance, we were faced with a
                    reinterpretation of aerial photography by more, and more skilled, analysts whose
                    findings provided a graver view of the imbalance between North and South. This
                    surprised many people, including me, but I accepted it. However, there were
                    others who voiced suspicion, and there were organizational jealousies. Even
                    among the military, there were differences. All of this vastly complicated the
                    process. The best we could do at the early stage of debate was to agree on a
                    range of estimates on the North's military strength.</p>
                <p>Further complicating matters, the officers responsible for drafting this
                    challenging document were not up to it and fell on their faces much to my
                    embarrassment. I brought in a number of people from other parts of the
                    government to help. Evelyn Colbert was a key one, and she gradually brought the
                    intelligence annex to a workable compromise that could be understood by
                    non-specialist consumers. For the NSM itself I was able to pull Bob Rich away
                    from a Caribbean post to help us on an emergency basis, and he quickly helped
                    bring order out of chaos.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>Producing NSM 13 was not tidy. The intellectual integrity of the policy making
                    process had been called into question; there was a cacophony of noisy opinions;
                    the subject was very complicated; and some of the participants were not
                    sufficiently adroit when we got to the stage of formulating options for the NSC.
                    My reaction at this critical stage was probably the consensus view: given the
                    politics of the situation, I felt it was important that we offer something to
                    the president - at least the crumbs that we included in our least damaging
                    option. We worked hard to devise a package that we thought should satisfy the
                    president, in form, and us, in practice. We did quite well, arriving at a
                    consensus with almost all key people in the establishment lined up to support
                    us.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, the president, with unexpected help from Brzezinski, overrode
                    recommendations that were strongly supported by Vance and Brown. We cursed
                    Brzezinski for helping Carter shoot down our clever effort, yet I must admit the
                    NSC advisor later played a basically cooperative part. When we met with him at
                    the White House to discuss subsequent policy issues and the modalities of the
                    Brown-Habib consultations in Seoul, I thought Brzezinski was pretty reasonable.
                    On at least two other occasions he pushed Carter to moderate his position, but
                    not in the car with me in Seoul in 1979!</p>
                <p>Let me now turn to Japan. As I have indicated, I thought we neglected our
                    relationship with Japan during the Kissinger era. In the Carter administration,
                    there was an opportunity to change course. Habib and Holbrooke agreed with me,
                    and I made this point strongly to Vance. Granting that the Japanese were
                    sometimes difficult to deal with because of cross-cultural communications, I
                    argued we had to try harder with a key ally in Asia, and we did. The Japanese
                    got much better access to the government's high ranking officials. Secretary
                    Vance treated them with the dignity and respect that they deserved - like the
                    Europeans, Soviets and Chinese. Both Vance and Harold Brown recognized Japan as
                    an important country, and the Japanese noticed the change.</p>
                <p>By early 1978, the economic-trade issues that had been quite contentious in the
                    past, began to roil the water again. Robert Straus, Carter's Special Trade
                    Representative, led a delegation to Tokyo. There was some tension with the
                    Japanese over this highly political problem, but not as serious as a few years
                    later. It helped that the President paid a State visit to Japan in 1979 in
                    connection with the G-7 meeting and his trip to Korea. Many Cabinet officers
                    visited Japan helping to clear the air. There were reciprocal visits of course
                    to Washington. Prime Minister Fukuda came in 1978; he was treated very well. It
                    should be noted that the term “treated well” has to be understood within the
                    context of Carter predilections - e.g. water, not wine, for lunch.</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>A big issue between us and the Japanese was the Japanese desire to build a
                    nuclear reprocessing plant to serve them and perhaps much of Asia. We opposed
                    the idea in light of our non-proliferation policy and concern over potential
                    misuse of the plutonium that would be produced. At the time I thought I was
                    pretty knowledgeable about this highly technical issue, but I have learned since
                    that I didn't know nearly as much as I thought. I considered it highly unlikely
                    that the Japanese would be tempted to develop a nuclear weapon and that
                    reprocessing to obtain fuel for light water and breeder reactors might be
                    sensible. We had agreed to let the Germans build a reprocessing plant, and all
                    the nuclear powers had them. I didn't see any reason why we should treat Japan
                    differently from Germany. I managed to convince Holbrooke, and he became even
                    more zealous than I. Mike Mansfield, who was about to leave to take up his
                    ambassadorial reins in Tokyo, was also eager to help the Japanese. On the other
                    side were the non-proliferation advocates, such as Jessica Mathews at the NSC
                    and people in ACDA.</p>
                <p>If I had known then what I know today about the problems of reprocessing, we
                    might have been wiser to discourage the Japanese from reprocessing and
                    developing a breeder reactor. But there would have been a real cost of Japanese
                    resentment. In shifting our policy we effectively weakened the non-proliferation
                    regime, stimulated concerns elsewhere in Asia, and let the Japanese wander down
                    a dangerous garden path. I should emphasize that the Japanese did not disappoint
                    us on our assumptions about their safeguards; they have done a superb job on
                    that score.</p>
                <p>The battle over reprocessing was hard fought. I remember that Holbrooke and I
                    gave Mansfield a very detailed briefing on this subject. We asked that when he
                    got to Tokyo, he weigh in with his views - often and loudly. Mansfield did that
                    effectively, and the president finally concurred.</p>
                <p>Another issue was our military supply policy. We had one policy for NATO members
                    and another for some non-NATO countries, like Australia and New Zealand, which
                    was a “lighter” version of the NATO policy. I thought Japan should be included
                    in the “light” group, and this was finally approved. Korea was sui generis,
                    because of its military relationship with us, including a joint command.</p>
                <p>At the time, I thought that Japan was in the process of becoming a major world
                    power. It had developed an impressive economy, and it was engaged throughout
                    Asia. Increasingly, relations with Japan were an important factor in our policy
                    toward the PRC and Korean peninsula. Together with China's re-emergence, this
                    was one the major transformations taking place in Asia, and it was accompanied
                    by latent Japanese nationalism, which could prove dangerous if not handled
                    properly.</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>These considerations helped prompt the Carter administration to raise Japan's
                    priority, to a level at least co-equal with the PRC. Understandably, there was
                    always some wariness. Although we considered Japan a most important ally, we
                    certainly did not wish to see the Japanese exercise hegemony in the area, if for
                    no other reason than that every other Asian country would rise in strong
                    opposition, particularly China and Korea.Japan's national security preoccupied
                    us in other ways as well. For example, we devoted a lot of time to the question
                    of the appropriate level of Japan's defense expenditures. We argued that the
                    existing level was quite inadequate and claimed that it forced us to compensate
                    with higher levels of our own expenditure than we believed to be fair.
                    Personally, I was ambivalent about this effort. The debate, which started while
                    I was still in Washington, reached its apex during my first year in Seoul. 1979
                    was a critical year when we pushed our views pretty shamelessly in both Japan
                    and Korea.</p>
                <p>As sort of a wrap up to my tour as DAS, I might point out that in the Carter
                    administration we tried to operate with an overarching policy for East Asia that
                    was broader than Kissinger's China-focused view and his tendency to treat Japan
                    and Korea as afterthoughts in geopolitical terms. In the Carter period there was
                    a basic assumption that a successful US relationship with any East Asian country
                    required a sound relationship with Japan as well as China. If not handled
                    adroitly, our displays of intimacy toward either of these countries tended to
                    cause a backlash in the other. Much the same could be said about Korea. All
                    three countries wished to be treated as important powers in their own right and
                    wanted equal treatment from the US. Thus at times we needed to tell the PRC that
                    our policy and military presence in Japan were a form of insurance against
                    ultra-nationalist tendencies that might arise. In Japan, we needed to point out
                    that we were protecting the region's stability by balancing the power of the PRC
                    - and the USSR. With the Koreans, we always needed to make both arguments. This
                    balancing act was, and today remains, a key aspect of a successful North East
                    Asia policy.</p>
                <p>I might also note that in the Carter administration there was an increasing
                    emphasis on regional economic relationships. Although these have since become a
                    predominant feature of economics in the East Asian area, the outline of this
                    development was becoming clear even in the late 1970s. By the time I got to
                    Korea, for example, there was already unpublicized trade between the ROK and the
                    PRC, growing rapidly and accepted by both sides even though not yet legal. I
                    always hoped that closer economic relationships would be a stabilizing factor in
                    the area. Japan, which was headed for economic super power status, seemed poised
                    to help the region in a big way. It was admired as a model for economic
                    development by other Asians who ignored the warts and faults of the system -
                    e.g. the over-regulation and closed markets that have hobbled it in recent
                    years. The PRC, on the other hand, had not begun to throw off the shackles of a
                    centrally dominated command economy.</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>A third goal of the administration was to sustain an atmosphere that allowed us
                    comfortable and acceptable military relationships, particularly with our
                    Japanese and Korean allies. This led us to hope that Japan and Korea would get
                    along militarily with China. There were even a few dreamers who hoped for some
                    kind of formal tripartite military relationship, which was not in the cards then
                    or now. But, as I suggested before, the balance that we sought in our political
                    relationships was crucial when dealing with military issues.</p>
                <p>I should have mentioned the Carter administration's human rights policy at the
                    beginning of my remarks, since they were woven through so much of our work
                    during my second tour in the East Asian Bureau. I was EAP's normal liaison with
                    the Department's new Bureau of Human Rights under Pat Derian. Much of the work
                    was done by our country directors and their staffs working with counterparts in
                    HR, but if front office help was required, they came to me, and I would contact
                    Derian's deputies or Derian herself. Although he was prepared to reinforce me if
                    necessary, Holbrooke, happily delegated this function to me just as Vance
                    delegated the responsibility to Warren Christopher, the Deputy Secretary. If
                    there was an important meeting, Holbrooke for sure and sometimes even Vance
                    would attend. The Under Secretary for Political Affairs, initially Habib and
                    later David Newsom, was deeply involved, especially if the issue affected more
                    than one region, but effectively most decisions were made by Christopher. The
                    human rights burden was a very heavy load for him.</p>
                <p>I frequently faced Christopher and Derian together, Derian as the prosecutor,
                    Christopher as her sympathetic judge, and I as the defense attorney for the
                    offending Asian countries. In some of these situations I could have used more
                    help from Vance and Holbrooke. East Asia was by no means the only area of
                    concern to our human rights activists. Most of Africa and the Communist world
                    was off limits for a variety of reasons. The Middle East as well as Central and
                    South America got their share of attention, but East Asia seemed to have a
                    special fascination. In part because of the international church network,
                    Korea's sins, for example, were a steady target. Derian also focused on the
                    Philippines, Taiwan, and Indonesia. The PRC was exempted, largely because of our
                    normalization effort but also because the prospect for human rights progress in
                    China was close to zero.</p>
                <p>I am sure that the easy access and considerable influence we enjoyed in East Asia
                    were subconsciously responsible for HR's special attraction to East Asian
                    targets. These were countries where we in the habit of frequent intervention and
                    could hope for some success in contrast to so much of the rest of the world. The
                    irony was that these were also countries where the populations were already
                    benefitting from great improvements in their economic and social situation, even
                    in some political areas. I had a hard time getting this point across. Double
                    standards didn't get in Derian's way.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>I fully understood that fostering human rights was an important objective of US
                    foreign policy, given the nature of our society and ideology which put such a
                    premium on democratic practice and individual liberties. Yet I did not consider
                    human rights abroad to be a vital US interest compared with war, peace, or
                    economic well-being. Human rights objectives frequently clashed with other
                    important goals, and they tended to reflect American views far more than the
                    values of the poor souls we were trying to help. Our objectives and priorities
                    were highly America-centric. A large portion of our human rights community got
                    its training from our civil rights movement; few had experience abroad.</p>
                <p>In any event, our Bureau of East Asian and Pacific Affairs had the responsibility
                    for balancing human rights goals against other US objectives. East Asia posed a
                    number of difficult choices in the late 1970s: Marcos was a very bad actor and
                    inevitable target for the Human Rights Bureau, but we were also trying to deal
                    with tricky base matters. Park Chung Hee was trampling all over the place in
                    Korea, but he was also ruling a nation of critical importance to East Asian
                    security. Chiang Ching-kuo's control apparatus in Taiwan had an ugly style, but
                    we were about to pull the rug from under Taiwan by recognizing the PRC. Suharto
                    was an autocrat, but he also holding together a nation of strategic importance,
                    etc. Human rights proponents tended to ignore the total picture and often
                    proposed using strong leverage against the perpetrators of abuse with little
                    attention to the consequences for other interests.</p>
                <p>Since I was born in Asia and had served and traveled widely there, I thought I
                    had some understanding of levels of economic and social development as well as
                    the cultural factors that governed Asian values and priorities. These were often
                    quite different from ours, although rapid development has by now narrowed the
                    differences that existed twenty years ago. Asians tended to focus on groups; we
                    tended to focus on individuals. Asians, because they had a long way to go before
                    reaching Western standards of living, wanted to catch up as quickly as possible,
                    even at some cost to political goals and individual rights.</p>
                <p>I tried hard to convey some understanding of this mentality to my colleagues in
                    the human rights area. Sometimes, I succeeded; mostly I failed. It was less like
                    a battle than going through a grinder. There were no senior people in the Human
                    Rights Bureau with Asian experience. They were really quite ignorant, unaware,
                    for example, that Park Chung Hee was close to his people and had done an
                    outstanding job of satisfying their most urgent needs for economic security,
                    social mobility, and education. Much the same could be said about Chiang
                    Ching-kuo and to some extent about Suharto in early days.</p>
                <p>Christopher clearly did not understand the points I have just been making. I
                    couldn't get through to him. Even years later, relaxing over lunch in New York
                    when we were both out of the government, the bias was still there. Pat Derian
                    approached the issue the same confrontational way she had tackled civil rights
                    in this country. Despite my frustrated efforts at education, I think I was a
                    good counter weight in policy discussions. Few problems were solved, but our
                    relations with other countries were not irreparably damaged.</p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>Most of our disagreements dealt with tactics. I was not a defender of the human
                    rights abusers. I shared Derian's and Christopher's distaste for ugly
                    developments in East Asia, and I was in favor of telling Park, Marcos, Chiang,
                    and Suharto what we thought of these dark blemishes. In fact, I could never
                    bring myself to defend Marcos in any respect, but with the other dictators I
                    could safely say that although their human rights policies left much to be
                    desired, they had done a lot for their people. You can see that the issue of
                    human rights “grabbed me.”</p>
                <p>Holbrooke handled most of the Congressional liaison work for the bureau,
                    including giving testimony. He liked it and was much better at it than I. He was
                    a very good witness. I did testify when I as acting assistant secretary, but
                    most often I talked to members and staffers in less formal ways. I met with all
                    of the members of the subcommittees both in the House and the Senate, usually
                    after Holbrooke had paved the way. I worked with the members individually and in
                    groups. The senators had an Asian discussion group which I was asked to join on
                    several evenings. We talked about normalization with the PRC, Korea and Japan.
                    All of this took a significant amount of my time, but I must say that
                    Holbrooke's contribution was far more important. Relating to politicians was
                    Dick's forte; he was superb at it and loved it.</p>
                <p>Somewhat arbitrarily, this maybe a good point to slide in a few words about a
                    time consuming aspect of our work with Congress, in Washington but more so
                    overseas. The subject is Congressional Delegations traveling abroad or what we
                    called CODELS. I began briefing CODELs during my first tour in Taiwan; I became
                    much more involved while serving in Tokyo, since informally I reported to the
                    ambassador and the DCM who were responsible for such things. I have already
                    mentioned that I was the CODEL escort officer for the delegation that came to
                    Japan for Ikeda's inauguration, and I must have served with five or even ten
                    CODELs concerned with Japan's foreign relations. Incidentally, no CODEL while I
                    was in Japan was as burdensome for us in the embassy as was Bobby Kennedy's
                    non-CODEL visit, because he saw himself as a surrogate for the president and
                    wanted summit treatment. In Hong Kong, we had lots of CODELs most of which
                    wished to be briefed on the PRC. Of course Hong Kong was a major attraction,
                    given the ample supply of good restaurants and shopping places. The flow never
                    stopped during the visiting season; one CODEL would leave followed almost
                    immediately by another.</p>
                <p>After Hong Kong, in the late 1960s I served in Washington in UN/P (then an office
                    within IO). There I inherited from Bill Buffum, a deputy to Joe Sisco, the job
                    of accompanying US Congressional delegations to the Inter-Parliamentary Union
                    meetings in various lovely watering spots around the world. I made many trips
                    during a couple of years; I saw CODELs from the inside. Of course, we had many
                    CODELs in Taiwan when I was the DCM and charge. Then in Korea, we had a stream
                    of important Congressional visitors. So during my career, I had more than enough
                    experience with CODELs.</p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>The value of CODELs was always a matter of controversy. My own judgment was that
                    if some or most of the congressmen and senators in the group listened and
                    absorbed, then that particular CODEL was probably justified. However, the cost
                    of CODELs was very high because of all the support they required - first class
                    travel for themselves and numerous staff aides, often on special aircraft, and,
                    of course, huge amounts of time from the Department and even more from its
                    posts. Embassies were often stretched very thin by such visits, and CODELs came
                    at the cost of leaving regular work untouched for periods of time. Those
                    negative aspects often outweighed the positive. If Congressional members had
                    traveled individually or in smaller groups with just one assistant, that would
                    have been a great help. CODELs, particularly large ones, tended to have some
                    members who had special agendas, such as striking personal deals with local
                    businessmen and officials or doing favors for constituents. These members might
                    have little interest in being briefed on policy and substantive discussions, and
                    their inclusion in delegations wasted a lot of time and sometimes resulted in
                    embarrassing situations. In general, I felt that if the Congress had operated in
                    a slightly lower key when traveling, its members would have learned more and
                    caused less disruption. On a cost/benefit ratio, CODELs left something to be
                    desired. Of course, there was - and is - no way of stopping them.</p>
                <p>My job in EA included supervision of the bureau's administrative efforts,
                    including assignments, efficiency reports, etc. We had an unusual operation
                    because of Holbrooke's predilections. He took considerable interest and
                    exercised considerable influence when he wanted to. But since he had a full
                    plate all the time, there were many decisions that he left to me and the staff.
                    For the most part we complemented each other on both substantive and
                    administrative issues. Inevitably, I took care of matters that were boring for
                    him. I did the follow-through, the paper writing, etc. On personnel, Dick did
                    very well at identifying good young officers as well as bringing new blood into
                    the bureau. I sometimes had to pick up the pieces, for example, when newcomers
                    blocked the advancement opportunities for other officers.</p>
                <p>I considered the system for choosing ambassadors highly ineffective. As in all
                    administrations, there were far too many political appointees, some
                    exceptionally incompetent. Vance was very proud of the ambassadorial selection
                    committee that was established to review all candidates for ambassadorial
                    appointments. My impression was different. Even if some poor candidates were
                    screened out, quite a few were approved for appointment. Apart from being
                    burdened with incompetents, I felt that we should have as many career officers
                    as possible serving in our area, and I vigorously propagandized that view. Our
                    use of ambassadorships as political rewards is almost unique in the world. It is
                    insane. I would give Carter's ambassadorial appointment system a failing
                    grade.Although I sensed that the caliber of senior officers was beginning to
                    deteriorate, the career personnel system had produced many good ambassadors and
                    DCMs as well as candidates. There was no shortage of either during my EA tour.
                    We did have problems with the aftermath of the Kissinger regime (GLOP), because
                    from those days on, management was interested in broadening the area experience
                    of officers. We got some good people from other regional bureaus that way, but
                    sometimes the Office of Personnel pushed us too hard.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>The system showed some real weaknesses when it came to country director
                    assignments. We could not find enough good officers at the right grade level
                    with necessary experience to fill those jobs. As I pointed out earlier in my
                    comments on troop withdrawals from Korea, I had a terribly hard time before
                    finally extracting a former colleague, Bob Rich, from a leisurely assignment in
                    the Caribbean. This shortage opened the opportunity for Holbrooke to move people
                    up the ladder, some of them too quickly, but mostly with good results. At root,
                    however, the Department's personnel system wasn't developing enough good people
                    for senior positions. The China and Japan country directorates, both large, were
                    probably the most strongly staffed, but they both suffered from the inbreeding
                    that comes with difficult language training. The others ranged from good to
                    fair. Korea was spotty, because it was not big enough in those days to be a
                    specialty, and was staffed by overflow from Japan, China, and anywhere.
                    Throughout the bureau, younger officers struck me as the most promising
                    element.</p>
                <p>Having been a specialist myself, I must acknowledge a frustrating problem with
                    specialization. To function well, both posts and home offices require
                    substantial numbers of well trained and experienced specialists, and the system
                    must be run to bring these people into their full potential. Yet the same system
                    requires that those same posts and offices also make use of other people
                    generally qualified for foreign service, especially those in other specialties
                    who seek broadening experience and recruits who must be tested before a
                    commitment to extended training. If China and Japan officers were left entirely
                    to their own predilections, they would probably form exclusive clubs, cutting
                    out outsiders and tending to isolate themselves from the stimulus of things not
                    Chinese or Japanese. They might not be bothered by this insularity in their
                    early years, but they would fall short of expectations in senior positions where
                    versatility is required. I must confess that it was easier to diagnose the
                    problem than to design a system that coped effectively with it. I sympathized
                    with those in administration who struggled hard to make it work.</p>
                <p>All in all I think Holbrooke and I were about as well served as our predecessors
                    in terms of the overall quality of the Foreign Service officers. We had a lot of
                    good people. I did encounter some mediocrity, but the system has always had
                    quite a bit of it. I worked hard on personnel issues. Fortunately, it was mostly
                    a seasonal work-load because of the summer assignment and reporting cycles. I
                    had tons of efficiency reports to write and review. That was a real work load,
                    since each rated officer wanted to have some time with me to discuss his or her
                    efficiency report. I took this task seriously, because the product was the basic
                    document for promotion panels.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>Holbrooke's style on co-ordination with others was very much group oriented. He
                    felt that many heads were better than one and that by discussing issues in a
                    group he would get both consensus and some enthusiasm for implementation. He
                    approached inter-agency relationships as he did the Congress, getting to know
                    key figures in other agencies. He cultivated all potential sources of influence,
                    and with a few exceptions, even Brzezinski most of the time, he tried to avoid
                    unnecessary tensions. He spent a lot of time on this. Dick and I worked out a
                    division of labor, based mostly on our instincts about the situation and problem
                    to be resolved. Many of Dick's contacts were institutionally inclined to be
                    helpful; some were friends of long standing. I think he did an excellent job; he
                    was a real net-worker.</p>
                <p>Holbrooke also set up an inter-agency group, which started small and grew as time
                    passed. I don't think it went beyond seven or eight in my time. This new
                    mechanism, which was clearly a Holbrooke creature, was readily accepted by other
                    agencies; it became so effective that people wanted to be invited to join. The
                    group met in Holbrooke's office once a week at a set time with a flexible
                    agenda. A lot of decisions were made there. Mort Abramowitz from ISA in Defense,
                    Mike Armacost from the NSC, and I were among the core members. Mort would often
                    bring his military counterpart - Admiral Crowe, who was exceptionally sensible
                    and cooperative. That got the group accustomed to uniformed personnel at the
                    meetings. Someone from CIA was usually present. Although Dick usually had an
                    agenda in mind for these meetings, they were free-wheeling - but not to the
                    point of inefficiency. The operation was an elemental aspect of Dick's network
                    of well placed friends in the bureaucracy. His “informal group,” as it was
                    called, was quickly recognized as an effective tool for policy development.
                    Non-members were frequently invited, for example, Les Gelb, then Director of the
                    P/M Bureau and Tony Lake, then the Director of S/P on the issue of troop
                    withdrawals from Korea. Probably the best way to describe this process is to say
                    that the group met as a small meeting of friends who were influential aides to
                    key NSC members. It was very, very effective. Dick was inventive and creative in
                    this sort of thing. His device to deal with bureaucratic problems served the
                    nation - and, to be sure, his own career.</p>
                <p>I might mention one other management innovation that Dick brought to EAP. Unlike
                    my other superiors, he encouraged me to establish a relationship with Vance and
                    Christopher. I already had some ties to the Secretary, but our relationship
                    deepened with Holbrooke's encouragement. If we were trying to see the Secretary
                    on an important issue, Dick would almost always take me with him. After we had
                    worked together for a time, he obviously trusted me to the point that he was not
                    bothered when, for some reason, I happened to see the secretary alone. He knew
                    that I would say and do the right things. I was lucky that we saw issues
                    eye-to-eye. Those who crossed Holbrooke regretted it for a long time.</p>
                <p>I stayed in the bureau for about 18 months. I was getting worn out by the end. My
                    work-load was very heavy. I used to leave home before seven and get back at
                    8:30-9:00 p.m. almost every night, plus long Saturdays and sometimes even
                    Sundays. It was very hard on family life, and undoubtedly a factor in my former
                    wife's decision to leave me in Seoul.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>Q: I think that brings us now to 1978 and your appointment as Ambassador to the
                    Republic of Korea. I recognize that you have covered this period your book on
                    some of your experiences there and I will try not to duplicate that. Tell us
                    first of all, how the appointment came about?</p>
                <p>GLEYSTEEN: I was in a good position to know about upcoming ambassadorial
                    vacancies. I knew what the Ambassadorial Committee was up to, and Holbrooke, who
                    was well informed, almost always took me into his confidence on these matters.
                    He relished his involvement in ambassadorial appointments - a kind of patronage
                    device even within the career service. As I recall, he raised the possibility of
                    my replacing Dick Sneider in Korea well before Dick had announced his plans. I
                    was one part of a program involving quite a few ambassadorial moves. Holbrooke
                    talked to Vance about these, and with some exceptions the plan was carried
                    out.</p>
                <p>I should remind you in this connection that Holbrooke's his first inclination was
                    to “clean house.” He wanted to control the bureau's activities and therefore
                    wanted to have his own people in key positions. He had some ideas about who
                    should go to the PRC, Korea, etc. Some of these ideas never materialized,
                    because the White House went into high gear politically for some of the EA
                    posts. I don't think either of us knew about Leonard Woodcock who was destined
                    to become our ambassador in Beijing. This took care of one of my anxieties.
                    Mansfield had wanted the China job, and I felt he tended to be too uncritical
                    about the PRC. For those posts that were of relatively little interest to the
                    White House political operations, i.e. uncomfortable ones, dangerous ones, and
                    ones with lots of real work, Holbrooke consulted me about career officers and
                    generally I think he made very good selections.</p>
                <p>My nomination was cleared by the White House without any delays. My confirmation
                    hearings went smoothly. I was expecting a difficult time from Senator Helms, but
                    the hearing turned out to be quite jocular and friendly; Helms in effect decided
                    to save his treatment for someone else. As I recall four members of the Foreign
                    Relations Committee were in attendance. The hearings were rather brief and very
                    superficial.</p>
                <p>I arrived in Seoul in June, 1978. I did not a get a chance to delve into Korean
                    affairs in great depth before arrival, because I kept working as the senior DAS
                    until the last moment. We had been preoccupied with China in the spring of 1978,
                    and, as I have mentioned, I went with Brzezinski to Beijing in May. Thanks to my
                    colleagues and considerable travel to Korea, I was not really surprised by what
                    I found in Seoul. I knew very well what was on my predecessor's mind; I had
                    stayed in the residence; and I had met President Park Chung Hee when
                    accompanying Secretary of Defense Harold Brown. My most recent visit to Seoul
                    was on our way home from Brzezinski's trip to China. Over a long career I had
                    come to know many of the officers in the embassy. However, as in any assignment,
                    challenge becomes more vivid when you actually arrive at post.</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>A special challenge was the relationship with the UN Commander - the American
                    four- star general in operational command of all US and most Korean forces. When
                    I arrived, General Jack Vessey, who later became the chairman of the joint
                    chiefs, was in charge. He was well respected by the Koreans, as he should have
                    been. Although I had given much thought to how best to manage the relationship,
                    I still found that the process required time and effort. I had seen the
                    CINC-ambassador relationship when Stilwell was the commander and Sneider was the
                    ambassador. Relations were between the two were strained. From my Washington
                    vantage point, I thought that Sneider had been energetic in his efforts to make
                    the relationship work, but Stilwell was an unusually difficult man - very full
                    of himself. He knew he was very important to the Koreans, because “he” provided
                    security and military assistance to them - not to mention use of the Command's
                    golf course and clubs. The embassy, on the other hand, was usually the source of
                    complaints and problems for the ROK.</p>
                <p>Besides personality clashes, the tensions between what I have termed “proud
                    ambassadors and powerful CINCs” reflected a range of institutional conflicts
                    that could easily focus on the leaders of the two institutions. In the command's
                    case, it had manpower and resources, which made it a key player in ROK affairs.
                    The ambassador had few, if any, goodies to hand out; in the 1970s and 1980s he
                    was almost always the bearer of bad news. The ambassador was supposed to be in
                    charge of everything except operational military matters. Many military officers
                    had trouble with this mandate.</p>
                <p>I must say that I was prepared for considerably more difficulty than I actually
                    had. I was pleasantly surprised by Vessey, who was a gentleman and tried his
                    best to work closely with Dick Sneider and then me. He never challenged or
                    undermined my authority, which was crucial since he had direct access to
                    President Park Chung Hee on command matters. Vessey stuck to his military
                    agenda, keeping out of my business as much as possible. For example, he behaved
                    very modestly when Carter visited Korea, essentially limiting himself to a
                    strong pitch against any further withdrawal of our troops.</p>
                <p>Vessey was succeeded by John Wickham. This time I was the “old timer,” which
                    helped, but Wickham was also a remarkably cooperative officer, respected for his
                    military skills and savvy about the political scene. Wickham and I went through
                    a period of political tumult and tension that required maximum coordination
                    between the embassy and the UN Command. We both worked hard to get along, and I
                    think our relationship was close to ideal. Both Vessey and Wickham were
                    exceptional officers. Neither abused the CINC position for ego satisfaction. I
                    did my best to reciprocate their cooperation.</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>Another of my concerns on arrival was Koreagate, which was quite a preoccupation
                    in those days involving, on the one hand, Korean and American venality of a
                    disgusting sort, and, on the other, counter tactics by the Justice Department
                    that sometimes bordered on what I would term “un-American practice.” Ben
                    Civiletti, the deputy attorney general and basically a very civilized man, was
                    pushed by Congress into using American law and standards in pursuit of foreign
                    officials, who while apparently guilty, were, nevertheless, protected by
                    diplomatic immunity.</p>
                <p>The origins of Koreagate were simple and one could have some sympathy for
                    President Park's objective though not his means. Alarmed by the way we were
                    extracting ourselves from our Vietnam commitment, Park apparently decided to try
                    to “buy” a more favorable U.S. policy toward Korea by bribing members of
                    Congress and the administration. Allegedly, significant amounts of money passed
                    hands, and Kim Dong Jo, Korea's ambassador at the time, was presumed to be at
                    least aware of the Korean CIA's activities, even though the actual payments were
                    made by agents and rascals such as the notorious Tongsun Park. Other
                    circumstances added to the American sense of outrage. The Korean regime had
                    lurched to the right with the highly authoritarian Yushin constitution that Park
                    imposed in 1972, and in 1973 Korean CIA agents had kidnaped the opposition
                    leader, Kim Dae Jung, from a Tokyo hotel room and almost killed him. The U.S.
                    media and Congress pounced on Korea for these actions. This was the environment
                    when the Koreagate scandal splashed into public knowledge during the 1976 U.S.
                    election campaign. Korea became a political pariah, almost obscuring its earlier
                    image as an economic tiger.</p>
                <p>If the tumult in Washington had been limited to outrage over the alleged
                    pay-offs, it might have died down sooner, either through neglect or prosecution
                    of the guilty. But a significant minority in Congress, mostly Democrats in both
                    houses, was already bashing Korea, condemning Park Chung Hee for human right
                    abuses and questioning the wisdom of our security commitment. Their views
                    reflected what they heard from American missionaries and the network of
                    anti-Park dissidents. In addition to thunder from these people, there was a
                    tendency in Congress to keep the finger pointed at Korea so as to deflect
                    attention from the Americans with dirty hands.</p>
                <p>The administration faced a tricky situation. Elements of a divided Congress were
                    being exceedingly demanding and uncooperative. Yet, given Korea's sovereign
                    rights, there was really no effective way we could get to the heart of the
                    matter. We could only do our best to pursue the alleged culprits on their home
                    turf in Korea. The first stage of this, the interrogation of Tongsun Park,
                    supposedly a private Korean citizen and not a government agent, had already
                    taken place by the time I arrived in Seoul, and it was less than a success.
                    After cross examining Tongsun Park in Seoul, Civiletti then wanted evidence from
                    Ambassador Kim. The Korean Government was shielding him.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>While wanting to be helpful, the State Department and embassy Seoul had serious
                    reservations about Civiletti's effort. On the one hand, we had little doubt that
                    the Koreans were guilty as charged. Their behavior was most reprehensible. On
                    the other hand, we needed the cooperation of the Korean government to obtain
                    evidence for prosecution of the Americans involved, and if such cooperation was
                    not forthcoming, there wasn't much we could do about it. We could have
                    threatened punitive actions against Korea, but our demands on Korea exceeded the
                    norms of the international system. If, for example, the Koreans had asked us for
                    permission to interrogate U.S. officials in the U.S., we would have turned them
                    down flatly. In fact, ten years later when the Korean National Assembly
                    subpoenaed General Wickham and me to talk about Kwangju, the State Department
                    rejected the request - while, to be sure, offering to be fully cooperative in
                    other ways.</p>
                <p>Pressuring us to do the impermissible was Leon Jaworski, counsel for the main
                    congressional investigating committee and a man famous for not letting anything
                    get in his way. The result was enormous amounts of talk and demagogic threat
                    from the congress forcing the administration to do things that were unlikely to
                    be productive. We tried to figure out a minimum level of interference that we
                    might request of the Koreans, providing Civiletti with the necessary information
                    without doing irreparable damage to US-ROK relations. I think Civiletti
                    understood our problem. As deputy attorney general, he was he was faced with
                    bipartisan congressional demands for drastic action. Yet he was too smart not to
                    recognize that nothing we could do could be very successful. He was quite proper
                    in his relations with the Koreans; he certainly behaved far better than some of
                    his Justice and FBI colleagues, not to mention the Congress.</p>
                <p>When I left Washington for Seoul in June 1978, Congressional committees were
                    still trying to subpoena former Ambassador Kim Dong Jo. On arrival in Seoul, I
                    was handed a telegram at the airport instructing me to see President Park and
                    convey the latest demands of Speaker of the House Tip O'Neill. Since I had not
                    yet presented my credentials to President Park, I had to settle for the foreign
                    minister and the secretary general of the Blue House. I had no doubt that Park
                    got a full run-down and made the decisions. O'Neill was requesting, really
                    demanding, that Park receive two House members as the Speaker's emissaries and
                    be given access to Tongsun Park and Kim Dong Jo. The Koreans were reluctant to
                    deny the request, yet determined to deflect it. We finally reached a compromise:
                    no emissaries, but willingness of Ambassador Kim to respond in writing to
                    questions submitted. Kim's responses proved close to worthless.</p>
                <p>I came to believe that the only solution to Koreagate was to let it grind down.
                    Also I had been told by perceptive observers that the congressional elections of
                    1978 would have a mitigating effect, as indeed they did almost overnight. During
                    the entire process I was never informed authoritatively about the grand jury
                    findings so I don't know how many Congressmen were really suspected of accepting
                    bribes. As I recall, only one, Congressman Hannah, was actually prosecuted and a
                    few others slid out of the way by quietly retiring from office.</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>Not long after I got to Seoul - probably in early October - I was called back to
                    Washington to testify before the House Ethics Committee on Koreagate. The
                    chairman of the committee was Lee Hamilton. The committee met me in executive
                    session - limited to members only, no staff and no record. I was the only one
                    present who was not a member of the committee. The session lasted about three
                    hours. Members were not personally unfriendly; they treated me quite
                    courteously. In fact, this was the beginning of a long and good relationship
                    with Hamilton. At the end of the hearing, the chairman asked me to return the
                    next day to see him and perhaps one or two others. That I did; I saw Hamilton
                    alone for about an hour and then he invited the ranking Republican member of the
                    committee to join us. I found the committee to be quite responsible. I was able
                    to be very frank with them. Most of the members were understanding, if not
                    entirely sympathetic. It was during these sessions that I was told the affair
                    would probably die out after the elections.</p>
                <p>The Korean leadership never publicly admitted any involvement nor did it express
                    any regret. The foreign minister, came close to it in our private conversations,
                    but the government did nothing. President Park was stubborn. He undoubtedly
                    looked at the misdeeds as a Korean would; i.e. honorably motivated acts
                    conducted in a style that was routine in Korea's political culture. He greatly
                    resented the attacks levied on him in the U.S. Congress. He viewed American
                    claims of innocence cynically. Whatever exonerating concerns there might have
                    been, the president's behavior was only one of many signs that he had been in
                    power too long and was out of touch with realities. At the beginning of his
                    regime in 1961, Park recognized the need to civilianize his government. He did
                    that, and the government functioned very well for a number of years. Later he
                    became paranoiac about potential threats to his regime -particularly after his
                    wife's assassination - and he adopted an increasingly autocratic style. By the
                    time I arrived in Seoul he was quite insulated; he depended almost exclusively
                    on the KCIA and information from his other special organizations such as the
                    presidential protective force and Defense Security Command. History has shown
                    that this was a very dangerous way to govern.</p>
                <p>Let me turn to management of the embassy. I never considered myself a whiz at
                    management, but I had some confidence in my style after having it tested in
                    supervisory positions both in Washington and the field. Some of my experience
                    had involved special challenges, e.g. the China analysis operation in Hong Kong,
                    INR with its personnel difficulties, and Taipei with the problem of interagency
                    coordination and supervision, not to mention changing policies. I had some sense
                    of how the activities of an embassy should be integrated. I had seen a lot of
                    bad examples that I was determined not to follow. I was sensitive to situations
                    that needed improvement, and I knew when the engine needed a tune-up, even if I
                    couldn't do it myself. My main goal was to make the embassy as good and as
                    internally coherent as possible.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>I was a stickler for the sharing of information - a principle that I was
                    occasionally forced to violate under orders from Washington - so that all
                    appropriate officers knew what was going on. I had seen several instances in
                    which the political and economic sections were barely on speaking terms. I
                    wanted a collegiate, well informed staff. I also believed in delegating
                    responsibility as it had been delegated to me in Taipei and Washington. I
                    thought the DCM should be managing as much as he or she could and that section
                    chiefs should be responsible for much of the workload. As for ambassadorial
                    models, my objective was to follow the style of some excellent leaders with whom
                    I had worked. I knew that an ambassador could not be effective unless he had his
                    or her bureau in Washington's full support. The reverse was also true. There is
                    a premium on close relationships between an ambassador and his main associates
                    in the Department of State.</p>
                <p>I was quite satisfied with the support I got from the Department. I felt I was
                    given special treatment. The secretary and Holbrooke trusted me; the deputy
                    secretary tolerated me - conceivably he may have liked me. From my EA
                    experience, I knew most of the Department's senior officials. Even after I left
                    Washington, my relationships with them helped in getting approvals for various
                    things as well as access during my frequent returns for consultations. Since the
                    bureau recognized my interest in several EA countries, I was provided
                    information that normally would not have been sent to our embassy in Seoul. I
                    have absolutely no complaints about the support I received from Washington.</p>
                <p>Although I was determined to share as much information as I could with the senior
                    staff, I had some problems after President Park's assassination. Washington
                    began to restrict information quite severely, complicating our efforts in Seoul,
                    but I think I showed my DCM virtually everything and the appropriate section
                    chiefs most things. I did so even when told not to, sometimes resorting to
                    letting them read but not keep messages or telling them the gist. I followed the
                    same procedures with the station chief and the CINC. It was vital that key
                    persons know what was going on if they were to provide advice or carry on in my
                    absence. Generally, I kept Holbrooke and Rich informed about how I was sharing
                    information. Sometimes I violated the rules, but we had an excellent record for
                    keeping secrets in Seoul.</p>
                <p>A few months after the assassination, there was a rebellion in Washington against
                    the over-rigid rules for information sharing (or non-sharing), and the
                    Department agreed to appoint two senior FSOs - John Holdridge being one - to
                    review the entire file and recommend what information could be given wider
                    dissemination - within the Department and to agencies as well. With good reason
                    people in CIA felt that they had been cut off from important information. I
                    think that we were far too restrictive about Korean developments as well as the
                    process of normalization with China.</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>I was determined to have effective relations with other agencies, probably more
                    so than most ambassadors. I wanted to be sure that the U.S. military and CIA
                    followed US policy without putting their own spin on issues in ways that might
                    cause problems in Washington or Seoul. Previous experience had made me very
                    sensitive to the problem. Fortunately, the leaders of both the military and the
                    intelligence components in Seoul were exceptionally cooperative. I have already
                    mentioned Generals Vessey and Wickham. Bob Brewster, the station chief, was
                    equally cooperative. At my request he initially gave me a very thorough briefing
                    of all of covert and overt activities and then kept me fully informed, often
                    seeing me several times a day. Although I was bit astounded by some of the
                    station's past activities, I think we struck a good balance of need versus
                    common sense during the critical years of 1979-81. For this kind of inter-agency
                    coordination, it was, of course, essential that the Department support my goal,
                    and Holbrooke did so firmly.</p>
                <p>Management of the Foreign Service was different from inter-agency coordination.
                    An ambassador has to use a variety of techniques for this. There's an art to
                    doing it well. Some ambassadors are very good at it, some are not. I would rate
                    myself as okay. I should note that I was generally satisfied with the staff I
                    had inherited from Sneider. In fact, it was more capable, certainly at senior
                    levels, than I had anticipated; better than those I had encountered in many
                    other places. I had no interest in cleaning house. Of course, there were some
                    officers who were not as strong as I would have liked, but that is true in all
                    institutions. In general, I found the embassy well run, and this efficiency
                    became especially important following Park's assassination. Without a very good
                    staff, we would have been in serious difficulty.</p>
                <p>From my experience in Taiwan, I was aware of the possibility of fraud in the
                    consular and administrative sections, sections which handled money. So I kept an
                    eye on both of those operations. There was no way an ambassador, DCM or section
                    chief could be alerted to fraud unless there were periodic audits of the
                    activities of all employees who handled cash and documents provided to the
                    public. When GAO or other auditors visited, I welcomed their efforts as
                    salutary. I would ask them specifically to look at our cash receipt and
                    disbursement operations. Unfortunately, some consular malfeasance did occur on
                    my watch. A number of visa fraud cases traced to members of the local staff were
                    brought to my attention while I was ambassador;.there was a serious problem
                    involving an American employee in AID that I learned about several years after
                    leaving Seoul; and USIA had an employee married to a Korean woman who received
                    benefits that aroused our suspicions. We investigated this couple only to find
                    that what we knew was only the tip of the iceberg. Needless to say, the American
                    employee was transferred out and ultimately fired.</p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>My book is primarily about events leading up to Park's assassination and its
                    aftermath. It touches only tangentially on economic matters, so let me expand a
                    little on US-Korean economic relationships. In the 1970s, Korea had enjoyed
                    rapid growth and international acclaim as a model for developing countries, but
                    by the end of the decade this dazzling performance was fading. The rate of
                    growth was falling, workers were restive, and Korea's development scheme was in
                    some trouble. Inflation was beginning to get out of control, and in 1980 the
                    Koreans found themselves in a significant recession.</p>
                <p>To some extent this setback was brought on by excesses stimulated by Park Chung
                    Hee. For example, the huge new defense industrial complex in Changwon was built
                    impulsively without adequate review. Motivated in part by hubris and in part by
                    military security considerations, Park wanted to concentrate much of the ROK's
                    production capability south of Seoul. The new factories, while state of the art
                    and capable of supplying some of Korea's own needs, were not of a scale or
                    managed to compete against highly efficient competitors in the international
                    market. The second oil crisis also had a crippling effect on the Korean economy,
                    which was highly dependent on oil imports. Fuel prices sky-rocketed, causing
                    severe hardships for the population. Fortunately, there was no wide spread
                    unemployment, and both the government and business community were still
                    confident the economic set-backs could be dealt with. This over-all economic
                    situation had serious political consequences, since economic progress had for
                    years softened complaints about Park's harsh rule.</p>
                <p>I was familiar with trade complaints, having worked on them while in Washington.
                    I spent a lot of time in Seoul working on textiles, shoes, colored television,
                    electronics, etc.- in almost all cases protecting over-paid American workers
                    from low-cost competition, which left alone would have forced healthy structural
                    changes in the US and brought improved working conditions in Korea. I also
                    supported Westinghouse against the French and Canadians as the Koreans expanded
                    their nuclear power supply. We even managed to get this item on the Carter-Park
                    agenda when they met in 1979. This was a time consuming effort for me and many
                    others on the staff. I didn't get involved very much in the automobile business.
                    In those days, the Korean auto industry was no threat to American
                    manufacturers.</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>Like our system of quotas, agriculture was another politically sensitive area,
                    especially rice, which was peddled to Korea by a rugged lot of Korean and
                    American agents reinforced by extremely pushy members of Congress. At the
                    beginning of my tour, the problem was rice imported into Korea from heavily
                    subsidized Japanese producers. Later, the problem was a crude American effort to
                    strong-arm Korean consumers. In general, American rice was highly competitive in
                    terms of price, but we had limited amounts of the short grain kind preferred by
                    the Koreans. Rather than let the Koreans turn to Australia and other short grain
                    suppliers, our rice politicians tried to bully the Koreans into buying cheap
                    American long grain varieties. I learned more about rice than I ever wanted to
                    know. I considered our position selfish, and I felt some of the Americans
                    involved, both the businessmen and members of Congress, engaged in extremely
                    highhanded and sometimes illegal behavior. We did quite well on other
                    agricultural sales. The problems of recent years had not yet surfaced.</p>
                <p>I did on occasion feel that the pressures we applied to Korea on economic issues
                    might have been a detriment to our political and security goals, for example the
                    pressure to increase defense expenditures in 1979 that were already very high.
                    Usually I was well aware of the pressures on the Department and understood the
                    reasons for my demarches. I am glad to say that Washington never pushed trade
                    issues to the point of jeopardizing the fundamental relationship.</p>
                <p>It took Korea many years to restart its economic engine. After the recession in
                    1980, there was minimal growth in 1981 and not much better performance for
                    several years thereafter, particularly if compared with the 1970s. Then growth
                    resumed at a 5-7% rate.</p>
                <p>Korea's recovery and our own recession caused problems after I left in 1981. The
                    Koreans began to accumulate a large current account surplus with the U.S., which
                    made sense for a country that had borrowed so much money from abroad.
                    Disregarding this principle that had benefitted us in the past, we began to
                    treat Korea more and more as a fully developed country like Japan. We pushed
                    hard for rapid financial deregulation, import liberalization, and currency
                    appreciation - all worthy goals, but in Korea's vulnerable condition they struck
                    me as unfair. Compared to Japan, Korea was still at an earlier stage of the
                    development cycle. Furthermore, Japan was a much larger country that had in some
                    respects reached developed status even before the war. The Koreans looked on
                    themselves as a developing country, and we should have treated them that way.
                    There is a parallel in our policy toward the PRC today. In the WTO arguments we
                    may have applied our standards to the PRC prematurely. In both cases we would
                    have been smarter to press first for a decade of serious effort toward bank and
                    regulatory reform as well as progress toward the rule of law.</p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>In any event, I think we have been very self-centered and stingy in comparison to
                    the approach taken after World War II. Then, as the only country that had the
                    resources to assist others, we did so with the Marshall Plan, etc. This
                    enlightened generosity brought enormous benefit to our security and prosperity.
                    I recognize that the world has changed. Much of the wealth is now elsewhere;
                    others need to do their part; and no country should have a free ride to
                    developed status. But the timing of pressures associated with the OECD and, to a
                    lesser extent, the WTO should have been managed more skillfully.</p>
                <p>I know these comments reflect my bias. Yet we should keep in mind that our
                    pressures contributed to the recent Asian financial crisis. Of course, the
                    Koreans and other Asians do not have clean hands - e.g. borrowing money far
                    above their repayment capabilities. During my tour in Korea, I felt that the
                    administration had some appreciation for the Korea's economic vulnerability. In
                    the Reagan administration, this diminished.</p>
                <p>While I was in Korea, our concerns about Korea's nuclear weapons program had
                    pretty well abated, although we felt that it still had to be carefully
                    monitored. We never found any evidence that the Koreans were restarting their
                    program. Their capacity had not been dismantled; it remained “stood down.” But
                    we were concerned by the strides the Koreans were making in a missile
                    development program that was in high gear. I worried about this, because I was
                    concerned that if the ROK were able to build a reliable missile force capable of
                    reaching Pyongyang and beyond in North Korea, then the temptation to develop a
                    nuclear capacity would be far greater. The Koreans were trying to use the
                    Nike-Hercules guidance system for their own missiles and probably could have
                    launched a few toward the North. We pressured them to limit the range and retain
                    less sophisticated guidance systems. Our military officers were less steady than
                    the embassy in this effort. Some of them were more anxious to help the Koreans
                    than I found wise.</p>
                <p>I endorsed the Korean objective of developing a powerful and credible army,
                    somewhat smaller and modern than the army of the late 1970s. The army was the
                    main defense against North Korea; it deserved our maximum support. I approved
                    many kinds of military supplies procured in the US - e.g. tanks and artillery.
                    The kind of tanks became an issue. Were the Koreans getting their money's worth,
                    or were we dumping our surplus older models while we equipped our troops with
                    much more modern versions? I saw no problem with the Army's being equipped with
                    short range missiles for defensive purposes.</p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>My general approach to most questions about ROK military capabilities was: give
                    the ROK everything that would improve its defensive capability; be wary of items
                    that were more powerful than necessary for defense. I subscribed to the general
                    American view that discouraged ROK acquisition of submarines, although I really
                    didn't feel very strongly about that issue. I thought it was important for the
                    ROK to have a strong coastal defense force to defend against formidable North
                    Korean threats, so I favored construction of frigates as a response to the
                    threat of North Korean PT boats. Whether the ROK needed bigger warships was a
                    question I never really had to face. In addition I firmly supported the
                    co-production of F-5Es and less eagerly the sale of F-16s to the Korean Air
                    Force. I didn't think the latter was a very urgent matter and I was mildly
                    concerned to avoid giving the Soviets a pretext to supply new fighters to the
                    DPRK. Moreover, the ROK did not have the resources to buy and maintain many.</p>
                <p>Much of my support came at the request of my military colleagues, which I gave
                    gladly since I saw no valid objections to the introduction of these weapons
                    systems into Korea. In general, I went along with the consensus that developed
                    both in the Embassy and the Command. I think I was much stricter than anyone
                    else, however, on the nuclear and missile issues.</p>
                <p>While on this general subject, I should mention that the MAAG's dual role posed
                    no problem. It was part of the embassy and part of the command as well. The MAAG
                    chiefs - I think we had two while I was in Seoul - understood their delicate
                    position and were always responsive to both the CINC and myself. That was very
                    unlike Taiwan where the MAAG chief played games behind our back and got
                    fired.</p>
                <p>Now for other programs. I thought the USIA program was pretty good, comparing
                    well with other operations I had seen, except perhaps the complex program in
                    Japan that was endowed with some of the Agency's best talent. USIA was very
                    helpful to me in the handling of the press. The PAO himself, his deputy, and the
                    press attache were extremely responsive; they played a crucial role in helping
                    me get our message out to the public, especially during the Kwangju crisis. They
                    monitored the military broadcast facilities effectively. I always sensed they
                    were doing their best for me, often very imaginatively.</p>
                <p>Other USIA activities seem to have been handled alright, although I did not
                    really have enough direct experience to judge them fairly. We had a branch PAO
                    in Kwangju and later in Pusan. I found the pattern of concentrating our efforts
                    in Seoul detrimental to our knowledge of what was going on in Korea as well as
                    to getting our message spread to the people. Unfortunately, our establishment in
                    Kwangju folded when the crisis arose there, and we had no one on the spot to
                    observe what was going on. Although Pusan was an important center for political
                    reasons as well as commercial ones, it was a major battle to get Washington to
                    approve the establishment of a USIA Branch and later a consulate in Korea's
                    second largest city.</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>My general impression is that we covered Korea quite well with our roving embassy
                    officers and military presence in many parts of the country. Thanks to the
                    logistic support that the command provided, I flew frequently to Pusan, Kwangju,
                    Taegu and other major centers. I could go places and come back in one day.
                    Sometimes I traveled by helicopter with the CINC but usually by car or train
                    with Bill Clark or someone else from the political and economic sections. Most
                    embassy officers traveled quite a bit; moreover, we sent people on long details
                    to Pusan so that we could cover events in the south.</p>
                <p>I made many public appearances - often with a speech. We never had to seek out
                    invitations. I gave only a few major speeches, one to the Korea-America
                    Association dealing with human rights and then perhaps four or five others. I
                    wrote these myself to discuss my views on a major policy issue - relations with
                    the PRC, North Korea, human rights. I wanted to engage the audience or Koreans
                    in general in a dialogue on the themes of my speech. I always had the
                    Department's approval. I recently re-read some of my speeches and thought they
                    weren't bad.</p>
                <p>I remember one in particular. I was anxious to foster more enlightened South
                    Korean attitudes toward North Korea - just as I had encouraged objectivity in
                    Taiwan with regard to the PRC. I didn't have in mind softening the ugly image of
                    Kim Il Sung's regime, but rather to encourage South Koreans to seek better
                    information about the North - more factual and less propagandistic. Their
                    understanding about the north depended almost exclusively on information coming
                    from the government which demonized the place. South Koreans would not even use
                    the proper name for North Korea. As a modest effort toward greater objectivity,
                    I gave a well-advertised speech discussing how both the US and the ROK might
                    seek to ease tensions on the Peninsula. For the first time a US official had
                    ever done so, I used the proper name for North Korea, “Democratic People's
                    Republic of Korea (DPRK),” throughout the text. Despite some initial Cold War
                    reflexes, the Department had approved the text, and my audience, a group
                    assembled in Seoul by the Financial Times loved it because it was controversial.
                    Paying little if any attention to the topic, the Korean language press made a
                    big fuss over the terminology issue; President Park complained to me in person
                    about my use of the term DPRK, admitting, however, that it was not the end of
                    the world. I think President Kim Dae Jung was the first important Korean to take
                    on the crazies who for decades exacerbated the anti-North Korean animus among
                    South Koreans. Until recently, objectivity was often equated with being
                    pro-North Korean.</p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>A few words about President Park Chung Hee. I had met him and had talked to him,
                    at least superficially, before being posted to Seoul. During my assignment in
                    Korea we had many talks mostly about difficult subjects. While recognizing his
                    major deficiencies, I was always an admirer of his nation building. In dealings
                    with me he was modest, and he never berated me for delivering unpleasant
                    messages. I had the impression he respected me for dealing with him in his own
                    way. The real test of our relationship came at the Summit meeting in 1979.
                    Although Park was incredibly difficult during his sessions with Carter, he
                    appreciated what I and others had done for Korea, particularly on the troop
                    withdrawal issue, and he was extremely responsive to my urgent requests for help
                    to save the summit.</p>
                <p>My assessment of Park Chung Hee does not differ much from the prevailing one. He
                    had obvious faults as a leader, which became increasingly severe toward the end
                    of his rule. By then he was running an abusive authoritarian regime and his days
                    were numbered. In addition to increasing authoritarianism, the regime was
                    crippled by Park's reliance on bad advice from his intelligence flunkies and the
                    lack of constitutional arrangements for a peaceful succession. By 1979, his
                    deficiencies were increasingly evident to all.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, from the perspective of Korean misery in the 1950s and 1960s,
                    Park Chung Hee contributed enormously to his country's progress. He was a
                    visionary leader who brought about a remarkable advance in Korea's economy and
                    security. He understood what the unsophisticated majority of the people wanted
                    in those days - economic security and a sense of progress. He was shrewd and
                    perceptive about the outer world, as on would expect from was one of the world's
                    longest surviving leaders. I remember his tour d'horizon with Dick Holbrooke in
                    March 1979. When they got to our post war problems with Vietnam, Park described
                    Vietnam as an “adolescent” country, an apt description with its implied
                    criticism about the parent as well as the child.</p>
                <p>Over the years, I observed evolution in Park's thinking, mostly in foreign
                    relations. I leaned hard on him to improve relations with the PRC. He was still
                    negative about a rapprochement even after we recognized the PRC; he worried
                    about the impact on Taiwan. Yet, he was already more reasonable and thoughtful
                    about China than in earlier days. He talked of a future shift in policy, and he
                    welcomed my idea of visiting Beijing to promote some contact. The Chinese were
                    eager to reciprocate. Naturally, his assassination disrupted all that thinking,
                    but the evolution of Park's views made it easier for Chun Doo Hwan a few years
                    later to adjust policies - shedding anti-communist rhetoric and engaging the
                    PRC. Park understood the importance of economic development for his people's
                    well being, and he appreciated the relationship between economics and politics.
                    In historical terms, I consider him one of if not the greatest Korean leaders in
                    recent centuries.</p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>I stayed in Seoul until June 1981 - six months into the Reagan administration. It
                    was Reagan's policy to break with Carter's approach and get along with Chun Doo
                    Hwan. This posture ensured final success in our long effort to get Kim Dae
                    Jung's death sentence commuted and brought Chun to the White House as President
                    Reagan's first significant foreign visitor. Our acceptance of Chun's leadership
                    was inevitable, but the way Reagan handled the change of policy troubled me, as
                    I have explained in my book. I have never regretted the deal we struck over Kim
                    Dae Jung. That was a conscious policy of two administrations. I do regret the
                    speed and warmth of Reagan's embrace of Chun; it intensified suspicion and anger
                    among the people of Kwangju. Nevertheless, if you read my messages, you will
                    note that my own thinking had also evolved by this time. Once Chun was elected
                    under the new constitution in 1981, there wasn't much we could do except to
                    acknowledge reality. He was the duly elected leader of the Korean people, who
                    had accommodated themselves to his rule. Although there was resentment among
                    many Koreans, there was little support for radical opposition. I had to swallow
                    hard as we accepted Chun in this role, because I had worked so hard for a more
                    progressive outcome of the leadership crisis.</p>
                <p>I did not buck the new administration and simply did the best job I could in my
                    last six months. I offered my views whenever there was an opportunity. The new
                    authorities correctly viewed me as a professional Foreign Service officer with
                    no special allegiance to any political party. Although they offered to designate
                    me for another important post, I decided for largely personal reasons to
                    retire.</p>
                <p>Final Remarks</p>
                <p>I would like to end this oral history with a few thoughts about my Foreign
                    Service career. I must say that it was an extraordinary experience. I entered
                    the service during a creative period of US policy, and I witnessed some of the
                    construction of the post-war international architecture. At the beginning of my
                    service, I was exposed to many of the system's senior builders, even though I
                    was very junior worker. There is no question that my first assignment to S/S
                    greatly benefitted me. Subsequently I had good assignments, almost all proposed
                    by the personnel system. I didn't seek most of my assignments, and I only balked
                    at one which I finally accepted when ordered by Kissinger. I was very fortunate.
                    Even at a relatively young age, I was assigned senior responsibilities several
                    times. I think I met the challenge. I enjoyed my work, and I left the service of
                    my own volition while my brain cells were still healthy.</p>
                <p>There is another side to this positive view of the Foreign Service. I was lucky.
                    The Foreign Service I knew and enjoyed is gone. Today, assignments based on
                    “bids” seem haphazard; people more gifted than I do not get the choice of the
                    kind of work I enjoyed; people who have jumped the career system through
                    political connections get far more if not most of the key posts. Personnel gets
                    far less attention, and the whole system offers much less support than it
                    should. All that translates into a very demoralized Service. Along with many
                    others, I face the dilemma of what to say to young people who are considering a
                    Foreign Service career.</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>I have not done enough careful research to pontificate about the kinds of
                    fundamental change that have eaten away the system in which I served. Even so, I
                    want to sound off on a few points. On the policy side, while we haven't become
                    an isolationist country, I now find a niggardly quality about our behavior that
                    contrasts unfavorably with the generosity and engagement of the post-war years.
                    We seem to have convinced ourselves that we don't need to pay a penny more than
                    our statistical share of costs for maintenance of the world system. The trauma
                    of Vietnam has left us so skittish about casualties in peace-keeping and
                    peace-making that we often lack use of our military clout in managing conflict.
                    We are not only mean spirited about paying our dues to the international system,
                    but our boasts about free market competition skip over the extent of economic
                    protectionism we still practice under various rubrics. I cannot see anyone
                    coming on a white horse to save us from these and other sins, so I foresee a
                    period of fumbling and frustration that will not be helped by the large number
                    of Americans who voice contempt for anything “international.”</p>
                <p>The politicization of the system is now endemic, regardless of party in power.
                    That is also very demoralizing to me as I go through the litany of my
                    complaints. Senior officers do not get the respect they should; too many are
                    shunted off into meaningless assignments; and very few get good embassies. It is
                    true that the Foreign Service has always accommodated “outsiders” and benefitted
                    from those who were skilled and influential. Now, however, political appointees
                    are no longer outsiders; they dominate the system. Since assignments are a zero
                    sum game, career people have far fewer opportunities, further engendering poor
                    morale.</p>
                <p>In the past officers might be assigned to as many as several ambassadorial posts
                    during a long career. Today, the top notch people in DCM positions have
                    diminishing prospects of a single ambassadorial posting, and some of the best
                    are leaving while they are still young enough for a second career, which might
                    be financially and intellectually more rewarding. That is a bad sign.</p>
                <p>I have two final comments focused less directly on the Foreign Service. First, I
                    am grateful that fate exposed me to some important aspects of world history in
                    the making, particularly China. China has undergone huge change in my lifetime,
                    and I had an unusual degree of exposure to this from many vantage points. As I
                    have stated repeatedly in this account, I was critical about how long it took us
                    to face up to realities. Needless to say, I was fascinated to be part of the
                    process that finally broke through the forces of resistence. In the 1970s I
                    hoped that the Nixon experience would open up a sustained new era with China; in
                    fact it did, but US policy toward China remains peculiarly vulnerable to shifts
                    in the political winds - romantic surges of absorption with things Chinese
                    followed by displays of hostility toward China.</p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>I have watched these swings all my life, beginning with my missionary parents in
                    Beijing. I don't know why is it so difficult for us to have a steady
                    relationship with China, reflecting a sensible consensus about what is important
                    and what is less important in dealings between two large nations entangled by
                    history. Driven by domestic forces, we spend too much time on Tibet, human
                    rights, and Chinese domestic practices that are beyond our power to change. In
                    the process we often obscure the importance of security, political, and economic
                    considerations that call for our engagement with China - even when China is
                    being very difficult.Second, I want to vent some criticism of our genuinely
                    great country. The United States is an exceptional nation - in its origins, its
                    institutions, its resources, its protected location, its dominance, and its
                    hutzpa. We deserve credit for making immensely important decisions about the
                    world's fate, if not always speedily at least before it was too late. Despite a
                    lot of foolish rhetoric, we have followed basically sane policies. Yet, as I
                    view things today, I am struck by the contrast between our self image as a
                    progressive and democratic country leading the world with our understanding and
                    power, and the quite different image seen by many others.</p>
                <p>Even though we resent being told so, we frequently strike others as arrogant and
                    self-centered. We don't even realize that some people abroad view us as a kind
                    of “soft” imperial power, dominating large parts of the world through the
                    invasive forces of economics, technology, and culture rather than by brute
                    force. We tend to judge the world by our own rather distinctive standards, and
                    we do this to an extraordinary degree. We have terrible problems understanding
                    the values of other cultures or even appreciating that this fault is a major
                    factor in our relations with others. We are highly ideological about our
                    political and economic virtues; the world's most tenacious defenders of personal
                    freedoms. We used to see ourselves as the bastion of the anti-communist
                    movement; now we are fascinated with our role as the only surviving superpower
                    and ingenious inventor of seamless economic success.</p>
                <p>These unattractive tendencies, which I have exaggerated to make my point, may
                    reflect our exceptional history and good fortune. We have been very fortunate to
                    be big, rich, and geographically isolated in comparison to almost all other
                    nations. Since the early period of our new republic, we have never been overrun
                    by foreign invaders, we have never starved, we have always had healthy drafts of
                    immigrants to do much of our work. That has saved us from the misery and
                    humility so many other countries have experienced, but it may have generated
                    some illusions about our accomplishments. In fact, our track record is not that
                    great. Despite our revolutionary origin, we are slow to change; we have terrible
                    disparities of income; and we are no less corrupt than many of the countries we
                    castigate for this universal sin. We pay little attention to history. Our
                    politicians and pundits constantly reinvent the wheel. We should perhaps be a
                    little more modest about ourselves.</p>
                <p>My negative comments need to be viewed in the context of the generally positive
                    picture I have of the US. We do lots of things well, including the way we manage
                    our foreign relations most of the time. I am proud to be an American. Being
                    raised abroad and working abroad intensified my love of this country, but I
                    think that we can do better.</p>

                <p>So that sermon is the end of this long winded account of my long journey. As I
                    said, it was great and I would do it all over again given an opportunity.</p>

                <p>Note-The following article by William H. Gleysteen, Jr. was written for the Japan
                    Foundation and published in the Autumn 1995 issue of Kokusai Koryu
                    Quarterly.</p>
                <p>THE AMERICAN ROLE IN POST-WAR NORMALIZATION OJAPAN-KOREA RELATIONS: REFLECTIONS
                    OF A DIPLOMAT</p>
                <p>The Setting for American Involvement</p>
                <p>Although quite aware of deep-seated problems in both countries, the United States
                    pressed vigorously during the 1950s and 1960s for eventual normalization of
                    relations between Japan and the Republic of Korea (ROK) and, as a more immediate
                    concern, for more friendly interaction of the two societies.</p>
                <p>U.S. - American interests in this effort were quite apparent. Occupation of Japan
                    and South Korea after World War II had demonstrated considerable American
                    realism about Japan's - if not Korea's - strategic importance. But the
                    combination of a spreading Cold War, a communist victory in China, and the
                    strength of communist forces deployed south during the Korean War convinced
                    Americans of the need to contain the communist countries by means of a broadly
                    deployed, forward, American military presence in the West Pacific.</p>
                <p>Japan was geographically key to this effort, while Korea was the front line where
                    huge military forces still confronted each other under a fragile armistice.
                    Hospitable basing arrangements for the U.S. were essential as were the freedom
                    to maintain military mobility among the peripheral countries of East Asia. These
                    were active concerns. For example, the sensitivities Americans originally
                    encountered in operating from Japan during the Korean War seemed likely to
                    continue handicapping operations under Peace Treaty arrangements unless the
                    Japanese and South Koreans could be convinced that their fates were
                    inter-connected. In short, it was the perception - often exaggerated - of a
                    massive communist threat which motivated the Americans to offer good offices for
                    the Japan-ROK normalization effort. As far as I can recall, economic
                    considerations, so important today, played little role.</p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>Korea - The view from Korea and Japan was rather different. When I arrived in
                    Tokyo in the summer of 1958 Koreans still had first hand memories of Japanese
                    colonial rule. These were usually bitter and reinforced by current knowledge of
                    the way Koreans in Japan were treated as second class members of society. The
                    South was a very poor, very undeveloped agricultural society devastated by the
                    war. Exports were insignificant, and the country was heavily dependent on large
                    amounts of American aid, which seemed ineffective - in contrast to Japan's rapid
                    economic recovery. Americans talked foolishly and ignorantly of Korea as a
                    “basket case” of foreign aid. Foreign criticism and ridicule reinforced Korean
                    feelings of insecurity and resentment. Koreans secretly envied Japan's post-war
                    success and openly resented the economic benefits Japan reaped without sacrifice
                    from Korean War procurements.</p>
                <p>In these circumstances Koreans developed an almost universal feeling that Japan
                    owed their country an enormous debt for which it would have to pay huge
                    compensation. To make matters worse, President Syngman Rhee deliberately
                    stimulated anti-Japanese nationalism, sometimes with the same fervor he directed
                    against his mortal enemies in the north. Fortunately, not all Koreans were so
                    extreme, emotional, and backward looking about Japan. Many recognized that the
                    Korean War had underscored Japan's importance to Korean security. Looking ahead,
                    some saw Japan as an economic model, and they kept their resentments under
                    restraint in hopes that Japan might someday be pressured and/or tempted to
                    provide help for Korea's development. The most prominent of these wasGeneral
                    Park Chung Hee who came to power through a military coup in 1961 in defiance of
                    the U.S. and democratically elected leaders. His perceptiveness about Korea's
                    needs for economic development as well as his strength were decisive in the
                    ROK's agreement to the 1965 settlement.</p>
                <p>Japan - Japanese views were complex because of sharply opposed attitudes toward
                    defeat in the Pacific War, differing assessments of the communist threat, and
                    the division of Korea into a zero sum situation of north versus South. Although
                    all political parties accepted the restraints of Japan's pacifist constitution,
                    elements associated with the Liberal Democratic Party sensed a real, if
                    indirect, military threat from North Korea, resented the bullying posture of the
                    Soviet Union, and recognized the complications posed by the PRC for the United
                    States, especially in dealing with Taiwan. These views were reflected in the
                    newly revised Security Treaty arrangements which allowed the United States to
                    undergird its military presence in Korea from Japan. At the other extreme, the
                    Socialist Party and the large left wing trade unions were unrelenting in their
                    literalist interpretation of the constitution and militantly opposed to even
                    indirect Japanese involvement in South Korea's defense. Whatever their personal
                    views, these left wing Japanese collectively identified themselves spiritually
                    with Communist China and North Korea, not the U.S. and South Korea.</p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>This cleavage, which peaked with rioting and turmoil during Diet ratification of
                    the Security Treaty in 1960, has virtually disappeared. But, for those of us
                    physically present in the American Embassy in 1960, Japan seemed bitterly,
                    almost violently, divided within itself over this defense issue. Combined with
                    upheaval in Korea it was clearly the low point for our effort to reconcile Japan
                    and the ROK.</p>
                <p>Prevailing Japanese opinion about the Korean people and Japan's past behavior
                    also complicated the process of rapprochement. While large numbers of Japanese
                    felt remorse over their country's colonial occupation of Korea, some tried to
                    defend Japan's 19th Century actions as “learned from the West” or “beneficial to
                    the Koreans.” Even some of the remorseful Japanese felt Japan had done
                    considerable good for the Korea during the colonial era; others barely disguised
                    or openly voiced doubts about Korea's capability to govern itself. These
                    Japanese sentiments infuriated Koreans, compounding the problem of pervasive
                    discrimination against the Korean minority in Japan.</p>
                <p>Such was the bleak situation existing between our Japanese and Korean allies most
                    of the time I was assigned to Tokyo. Nevertheless, although often feeling
                    battered and discouraged, we kept up the pressure on Japan and Korea for a whole
                    decade before the settlement was ratified in 1965.</p>
                <p>The Issues</p>
                <p>Fishing rights and ship seizures - More or less parallel with DPRK practice, the
                    ROK claimed control over fishing in a vast sweep of international waters around
                    Korea. While these control zones would not be judged completely outlandish by
                    today's Law of the Sea, they were considered abusively large in an era when
                    territorial waters were limited to 3 or 12 miles and fishing zones in
                    international waters were generally not recognized. Moreover, the ROK
                    established these zones unilaterally, included traditional Japanese fishing
                    grounds, and enforced the zones with armed vessels supplied under U.S. military
                    aid. Although the Japanese Government refused to recognize the ROK zones, it
                    tried to keep its fishermen away from ROK territorial waters and generally
                    concentrated in traditional fishing grounds.</p>
                <p>During President Rhee's time, the Koreans seized large numbers of Japanese
                    fishing vessels and imprisoned their crews, often for years, using their
                    periodic release as leverage in the negotiations. The pattern of seizures was
                    not only arbitrary, but also dangerous, because Japanese fishermen were usually
                    under surveillance by vessels of Japan's maritime coastal force. Fortunately,
                    even though these escorts were often faster and as well armed as the attacking
                    Korean vessels, they were under orders to stop short of shooting
                    confrontations.</p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>The U.S. Government's position was unequivocal. We were opposed to seizures in
                    international waters. After having checked facts with both sides, we would
                    always make a strong protest in Seoul calling for release of the ship and crew.
                    The protest would be reinforced in Washington, sometimes at a fairly high level.
                    During the Rhee period I cannot recall a single instance where the Koreans
                    responded promptly to our protest by releasing a ship and its crew. Even so, I
                    suspect our efforts restrained Korean actions, and they were certainly
                    appreciated by the Japanese. After Rhee was forced out of office, Korean policy
                    moderated, even more so after Park came to power.</p>
                <p>Claims and compensation - Compensation to Korea for losses and wrongs of the
                    colonial period was, of course, the core issue in the long drawn out
                    negotiations. ROK expectations were high, while Japan wished to keep the figure
                    “realistic” (low), partly because of the direct precedent for North Korea and
                    other Asian countries. Thus, to offset Korean demands Japan emphasized the great
                    value of substantial Japanese assets left behind after the war. While my
                    successors may have had better luck in the final stage of the negotiations, we
                    had great difficulty during my assignment in assessing the nature and extent of
                    these claims and demands. We had virtually no official documentation, and
                    neither side was forthcoming in discussing a matter that might compromise their
                    bargaining position. Nevertheless, since the issue was so central, I worked hard
                    with Korean and Japanese officials in Tokyo as well as with my colleagues in
                    Seoul to assemble a long and rather comprehensive report as one of my last acts
                    before leaving Tokyo. My personal sympathies leaned toward the Korean
                    position.</p>
                <p>Treatment of Korean residents in Japan - Again this was an issue where Americans
                    tended to side with the Koreans. Yet American influence was obviously limited in
                    resolving largely domestic problems which stemmed from Japanese prejudices,
                    Korean poverty, conservative regulatory machinery, and North/South Korean
                    rivalry. Koreans residents, most of whom were forced to come to Japan, wanted
                    the right to stay or leave, to choose Korean or Japanese citizenship, and in
                    either case to enjoy full privileges of citizenship plus some extra privileges,
                    particularly Korean language schools. Koreans were bitterly divided between
                    leftists in Chosen Soren, totally identified with North Korea, and conservatives
                    in Mindan, generally identified with South Korea and factions of the LDP
                    (including some venal elements). We argued strongly with the Japanese Ministry
                    of Foreign Affairs and LDP figures for equality of treatment of these people,
                    but we had no contact with the Japanese in actual control. American credibility
                    regarding treatment of minorities was not, moreover, very high at this time.</p>
                <p>Repatriation of Koreans to North Korea - Koreans in Japan who wished to return to
                    South Korea had already done so or were relatively free to go back, but the
                    pre-war and Korean War period prevented repatriation for those wanting to go to
                    North Korea. Around 1959 the Japanese Government decided to facilitate such
                    repatriation, causing a strongly negative reaction in the ROK, which alleged the
                    probability of coercion by leftist Koreans if not Japanese authorities.
                    Actually, South Korea was worried more that voluntary (or apparently voluntary)
                    repatriation would redound to the credit of the communist regime in the
                    North.</p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>Coming at the height of the Cold War, ROK concerns triggered alarm in Washington,
                    and we were ordered in Tokyo to try to stop the program or ensure that Japan
                    included adequate safeguards. After much pulling and hauling between Tokyo,
                    Seoul, and Washington, the Japanese Government arranged for careful interviews
                    of each potential returnee by the International Committee of the Red Cross.
                    Substantial numbers of Koreans returned to the DPRK from the port of Niigata
                    without significant incident. South Korea lost a little face; North Korea gained
                    some potentially troublesome new citizens; and we Americans took full credit for
                    “the defense of freedom.” Perhaps more involved in this affair than any other
                    American, I must say I never had any fear that Japan would allow any forced
                    departures. Yet, I also have no regrets about our actions, because Japan was
                    protected by the special precautions we forced it to take.</p>
                <p>How the United States Intervened</p>
                <p>By the late 1950s the U.S. good offices effort was a significant feature of our
                    policy, sometimes supported by the President himself and frequently by members
                    of his cabinet in discussions with the Japanese and ROK governments about the
                    virtues of cooperation and the dangers of confrontation. However, our Embassies
                    in Tokyo and Seoul were the principal locus of our efforts. The ambassadors and
                    their deputies were heavily engaged in both places, and they deserve much credit
                    for any successes. Although assigned to the political section, I effectively
                    worked directly under the ambassador on the Korean issue, and knowledge of this
                    allowed me considerably higher contacts among Japanese and Korean officials and
                    politicians than would have been otherwise possible for a junior officer. Most
                    regular work, such as identifying problems, contacting officials, making
                    suggestions or carrying out protests, and assessing progress, was done by me and
                    my counterpart in Seoul. Periodic ambassadorial involvement in the entire range
                    of issues helped reinforce our work and get necessary attention at the level of
                    the Foreign Minister or occasionally Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>Both embassies suffered from local bias, evident at all levels, including mine,
                    but quite pronounced with some of the ambassadors and their deputies. We in
                    Tokyo were relatively sympathetic to Japan, while it seemed to us that our
                    colleagues in Seoul were often too soft on the Koreans. Although this was for
                    the most part mild and to some extent amusing, it pains me to remember that it
                    occasionally provoked some very ungentlemanly vitriol recorded in official
                    messages between our posts. In a few instances I suspect it distorted
                    Washington's basis for judgement - never dangerously - and more than once in
                    Tokyo it was carried to the point where I felt I had to risk my career by
                    directly confronting a superior about his veracity and civility. The fairness
                    normally manifested by our Washington colleagues, combined with friendly
                    interchanges of officers between Japan and Korea, kept this problem under
                    control.</p>
                <p>Conclusion</p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>For a decade before the final Japan-ROK settlement in 1965, the United States
                    played a commendable role, stabilizing and buffering tensions between Japan and
                    Korea as well as serving as an “honest broker.” In this sense, the effort I have
                    described was never wasted, and it was often beneficial - at least in moderating
                    extremist actions. Nevertheless, U.S. efforts were not decisive in moving the
                    two countries toward the ultimate goal of fully normalized relations. The
                    decisive factors in realizing this objective were probably: 1) growing Korean
                    pessimism about the prospects for continued American aid; 2) new Korean
                    awareness of Japan as a source of capital and technology as well as an
                    appropriate model for rapid development; and 3) leaders on both sides
                    sufficiently strong and enlightened to break through the impasse. Japanese
                    governments had long wanted to reach agreement; Park Chung Hee was the first
                    Korean leader who not only understood clearly how rapprochement with Japan could
                    benefit Korea, but also had the strength to complete the process in the face of
                    widespread protest.End of interview</p>
