                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is August 28, 1992. This is an interview with Ralph
                        J. Katrosh on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies, and I am
                        Charles Stuart Kennedy. Could you give me a bit about your background —
                        where you grew up and were educated, etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: I was born in Pennsylvania in a little town called Kingston. My father
                    was a merchant and distributor of General Motors products. My mother was a clerk
                    in an office. I have one sister, a year and a half younger. I went to Kingston
                    High School and was there when World War II started in December 1941.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were born what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: I was born 1927. During my years in Kingston, northeastern Pennsylvania
                    was just recovering from the Great Depression. In order for that community to
                    get through the Depression there had to be a real common effort made by the
                    local society. Therefore, when World War II arrived there was a great deal of
                    cohesion and cooperation in the community. The community carried its cooperative
                    spirit created in the Depression years over into the war years and all good men
                    volunteered for the Service. All of us who were younger at the time counted the
                    days until we were able to do so.</p>
                <p>In November of 1944 the US Army came to my high school and offered an enlistment
                    and a college education for those who were quite anxious to put on a uniform. So
                    about half a dozen of my colleagues and I enlisted in the Reserve Corps.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>In January of 1945 I was sent to VMI, Virginia Military Institute, to learn how
                    to become a soldier and to receive some idea of a college education. To me it
                    was a great experience going from 3 � years of high school in Kingston to
                    Virginia Military Institute. I thought for sure, “The Pacific here I come,” but
                    for some reason only known to God I was put on a transport for Europe and I
                    escaped the mess of the Pacific at that time. I crossed the Atlantic and was
                    made a member of the Third Army Palace Guard, which, I think, resulted from my
                    experience at VMI where we were very spit and polish. At 17, once you learn to
                    polish your brass, I guess you keep it up. So I was with the Third Army Palace
                    Guard...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why do you call it the “Palace Guard?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: The Palace Guard was a unit that protected the commanding general. They
                    were always dressed for parade. They were quartered separately. They got a
                    little better food and when you weren't standing at attention you were free to
                    do whatever crossed your mind—within reason, of course. At that time there was a
                    no fraternization ban. You couldn't fraternize with the Germans, particularly
                    the young German ladies, but everyone did, particularly when you could do it in
                    the middle of the afternoon when no one was looking for you. We wintered in a
                    place called Bad Tolz in the Bavarian Alps.</p>
                <p>In April of 1946, I was given an opportunity to go to Nuremberg and join a
                    military police outfit that was maintain some semblance of stability and law and
                    order among the German population in the city, because of the war crimes trial
                    underway there. I remained there until October when the trials in Nuremberg
                    ended. It meant six or seven hours a day moving around through the German
                    population trying to look like we were keeping them in order, but Nuremberg was
                    devastated during the war. There wasn't a stone on stone in most of the city and
                    the population was very small in number. These people were picking up rubble for
                    800 calories of food a day which was made up of whatever was on hand in the
                    American stocks. There was absolutely nothing on the market. You could get some
                    green beer, but that was all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you pick up any emanations of unhappiness? Obviously
                        these are people who are on the verge of starvation. Were there any problems
                        in Nuremberg regarding the trial of Nazi leaders?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: No, but there was never any doubt in my mind that the German people at
                    that time had it in their subpsyche to square things someday. You could just see
                    it. They were very bitter and very stubborn and uncooperative. You had to push
                    them around, just a little bit.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Then there were great masses of DPs, displaced persons — Russians, Poles,
                    Hungarians, Yugoslavs, French — the refugee problem in World War II deserves a
                    lot more study and more prominence in history than I think it has been given.
                    There were millions of people from places torn up by combat with no place to go.
                    They were put up in DP camps consisting of tents. They had no clothes so what
                    the US Army did was to dye American uniforms, put on black buttons and gave
                    these people the uniforms to wear. The fabric was either blue or black and that
                    was how you distinguished the displaced persons.</p>
                <p>In August 1946, I was given leave in Switzerland. That was a great time because
                    there wasn't much to do in Germany but look at the rubble, but in Switzerland it
                    was like a candy store at Christmas with lights and an active society. For some
                    reason or other, the Swiss had a great appreciation for the Third Army. Wearing
                    the Third Army patch in Switzerland got you into just about any pleasant company
                    that you cared to visit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Third Army had been Patton's Army.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: That's right. While in Switzerland I was invited to a party given by the
                    American diplomatic establishment there. I was sitting in a hotel in Interlaken
                    with an Air Force lieutenant. We had just finished playing some bridge, and this
                    fellow came up in a polished Ford and said, “Would you fellows like to go to a
                    party?” “Of course.” So we went. There was a beautiful buffet and a lot of
                    glitter. I thought this wasn't a bad life, the diplomatic business.</p>
                <p>That is not as flippant as it sounds because I always excelled in history. If I
                    got less than a 98, I was upset. And geography. There are members of my family
                    who were professional military who spent years roaming around Europe and China.
                    I have always thought of these places, when a youngster, as being very romantic.
                    That, plus the fact that I like history and geography, plus this display of
                    rather nice living, prompted me to write a letter to my Dad saying, “Well, when
                    I get out I think I would like to try to join the American Foreign Service.”
                    This was in August 1946.</p>
                <p>In October 1946, the trials were over and I was getting ready to separate from
                    the Army at the convenience of the government. I received a letter from Dad who
                    said, “Look, friend, if you are going to do anything about a career you had
                    better forget about this business of bouncing around Europe and get back home. I
                    have a place for you at Georgetown and you probably could get into the February
                    1947 Foreign Service School class.”</p>
                <p>So I did. I came home and went to Georgetown and entered the Foreign Service
                    School in February 1947, with every intention of joining the Foreign Service.
                    Between 1947 and the early part of 1950, the stress, from my point of view, at
                    the Georgetown Foreign Service School, was economics rather than the impending
                    conflict between Communism and the Western world.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>So between 1946 and 1950, I thought Foreign Service was all right, but if I went
                    into business abroad I could make more money and still have all the ambience
                    anyway. In 1950 I used some of Dad's contacts and applied for a job with General
                    Motors. They said, “Fine.” However, I wanted to go to China or to some other
                    place in the Far East. I had been to Europe and didn't really want to go back
                    there and count stones. General Motors said, “Sorry fellow, there is going to be
                    a war in Korea and we are not sending anyone to Asia right now, but you can go
                    to Latin America if you want to.” I said, “I don't think I want to do that.” I
                    still know nothing about Latin America.</p>
                <p>In 1949-50, Chiang Kai-shek was being driven from the mainland. The Chinese
                    Nationalist government was looking to the United States for some succor but we
                    weren't really ready to make a strong commitment. If you research US domestic
                    politics at that time, the cry of the Republican Party was “Who lost China?” Of
                    course, the Democrats got the blame for that.</p>
                <p>At any rate Chiang Kai-shek left the mainland and arrived in Taiwan with
                    absolutely nothing. The United States Government didn't want to make too much of
                    a public move towards Taiwan at that time, so it agreed with China to set up a
                    purchasing commission in the Department of the Army. The Department of the Army
                    would furnish the Chinese government certain people who were expert in buying
                    and selling things the Chinese would need to establish themselves in Taiwan. US
                    personnel also would go to Taiwan and organize the Nationalist military
                    remnants, which were disorganized. Believe me, it was a mess.</p>
                <p>I applied and was accepted for this job. There were about 30 of us and we packed
                    off to Taiwan in 1950-51. The State Department had an excellent attitude for
                    dealing with Chiang at that time. The basis of our policy was, “Look fellow, we
                    will protect you on Taiwan, but we are going to support you only to a degree
                    that will allow this protection to be realistic. You have got to do the
                    rest.”</p>
                <p>Lo and behold, Chiang Kai-shek did it. The first and most important thing that he
                    did was to institute an agricultural reform program. If he had done so on the
                    mainland, the Chiangs would still be ruling the place. What he did was to break
                    up the landed estates on Taiwan, gave the land to the peasants, gave the
                    landlords money and said, “You can't buy the land back, but you can do anything
                    you want with it in terms of industry, banking and making money. But you can't
                    have the land back.” Well, you see what Taiwan is today. I maintain that it is
                    all because of US policy goals in 1950.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have anything to do with the people who were
                        helping doing this? We had gone through somewhat the same thing in Japan.
                        Was this an offshoot? Was Chiang looking at Japan or we just putting an
                        awful lot of pressure on him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>KATROSH: This was first. This preceded Japan. Taiwan was pretty much a going
                    concern before Japan got into its program.</p>
                <p>We put pressure on Chiang in that “this was the only option you have Jack.” That
                    was one of his nicknames, “Jack.” “There is no other option for you. This is
                    what we are prepared to do and this is what you must do if you are to receive US
                    aid.”</p>
                <p>When I arrived in Taiwan there were four paved roads.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: 1951. ...four paved roads. One in from the airport into the city, one
                    running from the Grand Hotel through the city to the eastern side of the city.
                    There was one taxi. The foreign journalists and top officials had some sedans.
                    The rest of us drove either Willys panel trucks or Jeeps. There was absolutely
                    nothing. The Chinese, though, I must say, fed us well and gave us quarters,
                    field clothes, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the midst of this Chiang Kai-shek was apparently trying
                        to use the Korean War, which was really very hot at this time, to his
                        advantage. There was an offer of “give us the training, the equipment and
                        the money and we will put so many divisions into Korea.” How did you all
                        respond to this sort of talk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Not a chance. That was strictly propaganda. Propaganda even in Chiang's
                    eyes. His army when it came off the mainland was absolutely worthless and in
                    1951-53, he couldn't put together two divisions that would go anywhere. They had
                    no uniforms, a minimum amount of ammunition, no artillery, no transport. They
                    just had rifles, and some of the troops didn't even have that. Their navy...I
                    think they had two or three LSTs, one of which I rode one time, and I think two
                    DEs that sometimes sailed.</p>
                <p>One of the things that did happen...there was just enough of the Chinese Air
                    Force left on Taiwan and just enough of our fleet in the Formosa Straits...at
                    that time we had a policy of physically separating the two sides...to force the
                    Chinese Communists to keep a good number of their divisions in Fuchien and
                    Chechiang Province. Also, the Chinese Nationalists held a number of offshore
                    islands, many of which they still hold. On those offshore islands the
                    Nationalists built up a guerilla force which raided the China coast and captured
                    small Chinese Communist and other flag merchant vessels.</p>

                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>KATROSH: Quemoy, Matsu, Wu Chen, Poichuan. There is a string of them, most of
                    them lighthouses, but the sizeable one, of course, was Quemoy. Tachen was very
                    small but very strategically located off the coast of Chechiang just outside the
                    port of Wenchou.</p>
                <p>There was a rather effective blockade of the Fuchou and other Fuchienese ports.
                    Butterfield and Swire used to love to run blockade runners into the Formosa
                    Straits and try to cut into Amoy or Fuchou on a dark night. The Chinese
                    Nationalist guerrillas would bring these ships to one of the offshore islands
                    and steal their cargo and send the ships back to Hong Kong saying, “Don't try it
                    again.”</p>
                <p>The guerrillas on the islands would take the cargo that they stole from the
                    steamers to Hong Kong and sell it. They then would buy provisions. They were
                    fully self-supporting...they weren't going to get a heck of a lot out of
                    Taipei.</p>
                <p>The British complained to us that the situation was getting expensive and they
                    didn't want to confront the Chinese Nationalists or us with a military escort
                    for these ships. They wanted us to tell the Chinese to back off. Eisenhower did
                    and that silliness, up to a point, ceased.</p>
                <p>But at the same time the people on the offshore islands became even more
                    dependent on Taiwan, because most of those islands...I have been on a number of
                    them and they are not self-sufficient, particularly if you have more than the
                    basic population in residence. If there is a military unit or guerrillas, then
                    you have to send additional supplies to the islands.</p>
                <p>This went on all through the Korean War. The Taipei government, of course, when
                    we had tens of thousands of Chinese Communist prisoners in Korea, went up there
                    to try to entice as many of them as they could to defect. My recollection is
                    about 12,000 of the hundreds of thousands did. But this action had no real
                    effect on the Korean War.</p>
                <p>The Chinese Communists tried to take Quemoy soon after Chiang left the mainland.
                    An old Chinese general, Hulien, one of the few good ones, beat them back. Quemoy
                    is in Amoy Harbor and it is like holding Manhattan against the United States
                    Army. The Chinese Communists didn't try to take Quemoy all through the Korean
                    War, which surprised many of us in the area at the time.</p>
                <p>In 1954, the first heavy Chinese Communist bombardment occurred. This was not the
                    1958 one when President Eisenhower sent in the troops. The public knew less
                    about this earlier bombardment, although if you read the US foreign affairs
                    records you will find an awful lot about it. They didn't invade, but they
                    bombarded it quite severely. They could do that because of the location of the
                    island.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>China did retake the Ta Chens, the northernmost of the Nationalists' island
                    chain. The Communists did that, I think, to free up any nonsense around the
                    Shanghai approaches and Chechiang ports.</p>
                <p>They never bothered Matsu. It is a little bit tougher nut...it is a piece of rock
                    sticking out of the water.</p>
                <p>By April of 1955, Taiwan was a going concern and it was time for me to leave the
                    “purchasing group.” On reflection I thought the Foreign Service might be a nice
                    place after all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Chinese officialdom that
                        you dealt with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: There were some brilliant exceptions, particularly the younger men
                    educated in the United States, as well as some of the older businessmen. The
                    military was hopeless, except for two or three generals who would fight. The
                    military was still very corrupt, the troops had as yet no real stake in survival
                    of the Chinese Nationalist government other than, for whatever reason, they
                    would be shot if they defected to the Communists. Taiwan was the only refuge
                    available to them.</p>
                <p>I think by 1955 that began to change. The older group was moving out. Some of the
                    younger men were taking the middle level positions. The army was beginning to
                    induct younger people, even Taiwanese, at the enlisted level, not yet the
                    officer level. We had a MAAG there and it was beginning to have an effect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The military assistance group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Right. It was a very small group, I don't think more than 20 officers.
                    They made sure that the Nationalist troops had uniforms, received pay, food and
                    medical care. To the Chinese soldier at that point of history, this was very
                    important, this was good living. A better living than many of the peasants.</p>
                <p>Then we, the US, re-equipped the Chinese Air Force. Also a cadre was organized
                    and trained for the Chinese Navy. Things began to look up for the Chinese
                    military. So I would say from about 1955 on, they became a more reliable force.
                    But prior to 1955 they were absolutely worthless, really.</p>
                <p>In 1955 I came back to the United States. By that time I had married and had a
                    son born on Taiwan. I took lateral entry into the Department of State, which was
                    expanding because this was the build-up years for the Cold War. I stayed in the
                    States for a little while getting trained and acquainted with Departmental
                    discipline and procedures.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>My first assignment as vice consul in Singapore was in September 1957 when it was
                    still a colony. Avery Peterson was just assigned Consul General. Singapore City
                    at that time was a very pretty, small town on the southern end of Singapore
                    Island. The rest of the island consisted of plantations...coconut palm, banana
                    and other tropical products. It was a very quiet place, still a colony, and very
                    British. Banking, shipping, and insurance were its strengths.</p>
                <p>The Singaporeans began to respond to British suggestions that they govern
                    themselves and become independent. This was a very interesting time to be in
                    Singapore because it was really the birth time of this now magnificent city
                    state, one of the great jewels of Southeast Asia.</p>
                <p>As a vice consul, the day was fairly relaxed. One went into the office in the
                    morning and stamped some visas and maybe took care of a shipping matter or two.
                    Then you adjourned around 11:30 to a place called the Singapore Club where you
                    had a couple of pink gins and a typical pukasab luncheon...mulligatawny soup,
                    game pie, and other foods that will kill you in the tropics. Around 1:30 or 2:00
                    you went out to the veranda where they had these lovely chairs with arms that
                    would fold in and enfold you. You put your legs up on these arms and slept until
                    2:30 or 3:00. Then one meandered back to the Consulate, stamped a few more
                    visas, went home, changed and put on a black tie and a white coat and went to
                    the Tangelin Club or the Singapore Club for dinner and another bout with the
                    bottle...brandy...on to cocktails, dinner, bridge, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is a wonder you survived!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Few ever extended their time in Singapore, but we loved the perks during
                    the two years we were there.</p>
                <p>As I noted, the ambiance was very, very British, but there was a serious side to
                    it also. In the development of the Singapore polity, the Communists were very
                    active and had a great deal of influence. Those were the days when young State
                    Department officers in Singapore...Ambassador John Holdridge among
                    them...learned how to deal with the Chinese who are now the decision-makers in
                    China, as well as elsewhere in Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later Ambassador to Indonesia, Assistant Secretary of
                        State, etc. etc.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>KATROSH: Holdridge was the chief of the political section. Although I stamped
                    visas, I did political reporting as well and during my last year there, I was a
                    member of John's section. At that time we had quite a good dialogue with World
                    War II Communist functionaries like Lim Chin Song, Fong Swe Song, and Devan
                    Nair, who later became a member of the government. At any rate, John was chief
                    of the political section. In the Consulate there was a lot of discussion as to
                    whether Lee Kuan Yew, then known as Harry Lee and who at that time could not
                    speak Mandarin Chinese, was a sincere democrat. Lee Kuan Lee is a brilliant
                    English educated lawyer who allied himself with the Communists and traditional
                    Chinese entrepreneurs and political warlords in Singapore. He had the toughest
                    unions and a good number of the business people, etc. Harry Lee, of course,
                    became Prime Minister.</p>
                <p>The serious part of the two years was monitoring and participating in the
                    struggle between Lee and a British lackey, Lim Yew Hock. The instinct of
                    Washington at the time was to favor Lim Yew-Hock. Harry Lee and his cohorts were
                    “Communists.” The British were very nervous about all this because they liked
                    Lim Yew-Hock very much, but Harry was trained in Oxford, spoke the King's
                    English, was an excellent cricket player, etc., and everything the British
                    admire. They didn't want to see Harry roughed up too much. But they worried
                    about the Communist side of it. I am certain of this because of the dialogue we
                    had with the British High Commissioner's office at the time.</p>
                <p>The elections were held, I think, in early September, 1959 and wouldn't you know
                    that Harry Lee and his Communist supporters, the People's Action Party, won the
                    election. It is 1992 and the same party still is in power and Harry Lee is still
                    the party's mentor. As soon as he won the election, one of the first things he
                    did...he is brilliant...during the campaign he learned how to speak Mandarin, so
                    now he can speak Chinese. The first thing he did was to round up all his
                    Communist buddies and send them back to Changi prison. Anybody who knows
                    Singapore knows Changi prison's reputation. It was a hell hole during the
                    Japanese occupation and being sent there was no small matter. But Harry packed
                    them all off and said, “You are going to stay in Changi until you repent,
                    recant, and if you do it to a certain degree I will ship you off to England. If
                    you really recant maybe I will let you back into the political process some
                    way.” Lim Chin Song never recanted to that extent and stayed in Changi prison
                    for many years and later went to England. Some others like Devan Nair became
                    converts and joined the government.</p>
                <p>The interesting thing was how quickly Harry Lee moved on the very people who put
                    him in, because that election turned on the working class of Singapore. That is
                    where the votes were and the Communists had the workers sewed up tightly to a
                    point where I think the Lim Yew-Hock group won something like three or four
                    seats in the parliament. The People's Action Party got the rest.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see this coming?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>KATROSH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you see Harry Lee as being a political worker rather
                        than as a dedicated Communist?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: He was a politician who had a unique grasp of traditional Chinese
                    instincts for very strong central leadership and a totally free enterprise
                    economic system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you saw him at the time as...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: It would have been better for US Asian policy if Lim Yew-Hock won, we
                    thought. But we said that the PAP would win. All the dispatches to Washington
                    said that PAP was going to win the election.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The election happens. How did we respond? Were we talking
                        or were we basically bystanders?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: No. At that time, and I can only go through 1959 because I got
                    distracted in another country, we said, “All right, so he won.” There was enough
                    sense of reality in the Department at any rate to know that this was the fact of
                    the matter and we were going to have to work with him. When he took the action
                    that he did against the Communists, there was full support for him in
                    Washington. He was obviously wanted by the local people and the British were not
                    upset; we said, “Okay.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were relations...knowing how we operated around the
                        world in that period, we must have been diddling around to some extent?
                        Obviously Singapore is a check point...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: But at that time Singapore was a Consulate General and although we had
                    some real professionals there like Holdridge, it wasn't that high on the
                    screen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What I am saying is that often when something like this
                        happens you end up with the man in power mad as hell at the United States
                        because he knows (1) they might have reservations and (2) they might be
                        helping the opposition or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>KATROSH: Harry Lee certainly had those feelings, but I tell you one thing about
                    Harry Lee, he doesn't let things like that bother him. That is part of the game.
                    Harry Lee knew that if Communism was going to be contained in Southeast Asia,
                    the only country that had any possibility of being effective in that regard was
                    the United States. You have to give it to Harry. He will close down a “Wall
                    Street Journal,” he throws out “Newsweek,” you can't do this you can't do that.
                    He tells people not to spit and fines them $200. He ridicules the US but he is
                    careful to maintain close personal relationships with the US establishment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking now about things that have happened in the
                        last decade...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: This is Harry. This is his mindset. This fellow is practical. He doesn't
                    let even his own preferences get in the way of his vision for Singapore. He just
                    doesn't do it. He will go up to Malaysia and kowtow to the king, hating every
                    minute of it, if he thinks it will benefit Singapore. The Malaysians know this
                    and that is why they kicked Singapore out of the Federation. They assessed Harry
                    as too tough. If we kick him out of the Federation of Malaysia, he still has to
                    come up and kowtow, but we don't have to worry about him taking our country or
                    jobs over...which he would have done if he had been successful in staying in the
                    Federation. He is extremely cold in that regard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you didn't find all of a sudden what you might call a
                        hostile regime sitting in Singapore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: No. It was not terribly friendly, it was correct, very British. If you
                    had some money and wanted to do business, fine. Harry wouldn't let us push him
                    around. If he didn't like something he told us. However, if something is a deal,
                    it is a deal and he would hold up his end of it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He is still the presence behind the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Yes, that is right. But that is the way Singapore operates, it hasn't
                    changed. And Harry is there to make damn sure it doesn't change. It has been 40
                    years. As long as he is alive, that government won't change. He has enough
                    popularity with the people to get his way if he wants to. You can call it a
                    benevolent dictatorship; a controlled democracy...it is not democratic in the
                    sense that we are democratic. But if you are a citizen and have a beef, you can
                    be heard. You get a chance to vote. If you want to vote for the opposition, go
                    ahead. I think after Harry goes, the PAP could lose power because the nature of
                    Asian society is such that...and he has done so well and so much for the state
                    that they won't cross him while he is alive. When he is gone a new emperor might
                    come in with a new “mandate from Heaven.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: I left there about a month after the elections and came back here and
                    worked for a while on the Southeast Asian Desk. Then someone asked, “Would you
                    like to go to Rangoon, Burma?” That sounded pretty romantic. My experiences with
                    Asia have been...I have never had an unhappy post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you served in Rangoon from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Well, first I went to Burmese language school at FSI under U Khin, who
                    is still living and still making quilts out in Maryland. I went to Rangoon in
                    late summer of 1962 and stayed three years. So I was there for the last year of
                    U Nu's prime ministership and the first two years of the current Ne Win
                    dictatorship.</p>
                <p>Burma is another story. It is a beautiful country, very placid people, very
                    religious. The parliament was a theocracy operating under a patina of British
                    parliamentary democracy. It could have worked if they had given the minorities a
                    little more say in the national government but they threatened to leave the
                    union. The army under Ne Win was not willing to accept this and they overthrew U
                    Nu and you have had the Ne Win dictatorship from February 1964.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe our Embassy and how it operated in
                        those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: The Embassy, unlike Singapore where we were on several floors of an
                    office building, is located in downtown Rangoon off of a park and square by the
                    Sulu Pagoda. We had 12 to 16 officers and a very active USIS under Jack O'Brien,
                    who is still very much in contact with Burma.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He is another one we must get.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Our interest in Burma under U Nu was to...we had a Military Equipment
                    Delivery Team in and out of there which tried to Westernize Burmese military
                    thinking.</p>
                <p>USIS did a lot of educational projects. We also had a small agricultural mission
                    trying to improve the quality of rice, mostly, as well as working up in the teak
                    forests.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>It was again a very nice, typical Southeast Asian tour until the revolution when
                    Ne Win moved in and created some very serious problems with the large Indian
                    population ...deported a lot of Indians...and told the minority groups like the
                    Kachins, the Shans and the Karens, like it or not they were going to stay in the
                    union of Burma and were not going to get any minority rights. He told the Burman
                    that if they didn't like it they could talk it over with the local army
                    commander whose instincts would be to lock them up or throw them into a pit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the revolution...you were there at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe how you observed it and how we reacted
                        to it? How did we feel about U Nu?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: We liked U Nu. We had good relations with him. He was very popular here.
                    He had good access to private funds and grants and that sort of thing. The US
                    Embassy didn't predict a coup. We went to bed one night and U Nu was prime
                    minister. We drove to the Embassy the next morning and there were troops all
                    over the street, U Nu was locked up and Ne Win was the ruler.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ne Win had been what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: He was the senior army commander. He also led the government a few years
                    before when U Nu asked him to come in and discipline some of the unruly
                    politicians, but then he voluntarily stepped back and gave the government back
                    to U Nu.</p>
                <p>The US relationship with Ne Win was not good and still isn't. He slowly, slowly
                    put the squeeze on USIS. He wouldn't let Burmese students go to the States and
                    he closed our libraries up in Mandalay, down in Moulmein and, eventually, in
                    Rangoon. He didn't want any more military aid, which we wouldn't have given to
                    him anyway, and he closed down the agricultural programs. He left no doubt in
                    our minds that he wanted to see us there only in a very low key, passive role.
                    All foreign and Burmese businesses were nationalized. The army literally took
                    over the country. It took over the banks, the private businesses and anything
                    else that was worthwhile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you see as our interests there at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>KATROSH: At the time we had no serious interests. We didn't want to see the
                    country go Communist, certainly. There was a Communist movement up around the
                    border...the Red Flag and White Flag...but they were not that threatening.
                    During World War II many of the minorities were very helpful to us, particularly
                    the Kachins. They ran guerilla operations for the US.</p>
                <p>The US mission in the early 1960s was to make sure Burma didn't fall under
                    Chinese influence. That is where we in the political section spent most of our
                    time. We wanted to make sure that the internal Communist movement was
                    frustrated...that wasn't much of a problem because it never was really popular
                    among the Burmese, but there was a pull from China. There are many Chinese in
                    Burma...and incidentally they suffered and still suffer under Ne Win. He went
                    after the Chinese who controlled the rice market at the time. He took all of the
                    business and their houses, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is easy to say that was our preoccupation, but you are
                        sitting at the Embassy in a place where we don't have very cordial
                        relations. What does this mean to keep Burma out of Chinese sphere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: After the revolution it was very difficult and like all other things I
                    think at that time that the Chinese, themselves, were distracted by the Soviets.
                    People were realizing that the Sino-Soviet split was for real, that those
                    fellows were going to go after each other. Some of the earlier pressures...you
                    see, Zhou En-lai, when he was foreign minister, courted Southeast Asia. At that
                    time the Chinese had a very velvet glove policy towards these countries and they
                    were very much attracted to him. Zhou En-lai was a very impressive diplomat. He
                    said: “Why can't we all cooperate. Why do you want to support these
                    colonialists. You are just getting out from under their yoke. Look what they
                    have done to you. You can talk to them, but look to our way.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am really talking more about what does an Embassy
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Oh, I see. Well, what you try to do...it took Ne Win about three or four
                    years to effectively do all the things that I have described and I would say for
                    the two years that I was there we could still talk to the government officials,
                    particularly to foreign ministry officers. They would visit your residence,
                    particularly if you showed an American movie, which were very scarce in Burma.
                    We tried to maintain contact, tried to show them the consequences that we saw
                    because of too close a relationship with China. We never said they should fight
                    the Chinese or not have a relationship with the Chinese. The Soviets were there,
                    too, and very active.</p>
                <p>Ne Win's instincts...the Soviet Embassy was larger than ours and very
                    active...were that he had these three—China, the Soviets and the US—to maneuver
                    against each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chinese, Soviets and Americans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Right. Of course we would meet with the Soviet Embassy officers and try
                    to get as much out of them as we could in terms of what they were doing and
                    thinking. They would, of course, return the favor. At their parties they would
                    have the Chinese there and when “no one was looking” we would go over and chat a
                    bit. We worked with the contacts in the government, trying to contrast the
                    options of looking at the United States' proposition vis-a-vis what was in store
                    for you if you worked with the Russians or the Chinese. The Russians would ship
                    in 50 tractors and they would offload them down in one of the ports...the darn
                    things were for the steppes of Russia not the tropical forests of Burma. The
                    tractors would sink in the mud. I bet they are still there; just a pile of
                    rust.</p>
                <p>A lot of young men in the Burmese government who were trained in the United
                    States would talk to us. They would go to Moscow and talk to the Russians; go to
                    Beijing and talk to the Chinese. We, in Burma, performed the traditional work of
                    a political or economic officer in an Embassy, of staying involved in the
                    community, of trying to analyze and determine what the intentions of the
                    competing forces are and then getting policy direction to Washington.</p>
                <p>In Burma the climate is very important to what you do. From May until October it
                    rains every day. By August you look at the wall and the nail marks are there,
                    you can't get out. It is a monsoon climate with a very heavy monsoon. Monsoon
                    ditches in Burma were as big as a 9' x 12' room. You could drown in them and
                    sometimes an unfortunate youngster did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you are really nailed home?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: You are nailed in the city. It is very difficult to travel around in
                    Burma during the monsoon season. Now from October to May it doesn't rain. This
                    is the cool season. Then is when you go “up country.” Then is when you talk to
                    the villagers. Then is when you go up to Mandalay, or Maymyo or Lashio.</p>
                <p>But slowly, slowly, Ne Win every two or three months would narrow, narrow, the
                    scope of our travel until by the time I left there you could go from Rangoon to
                    Pegu and that was it. Now, I understand, one can travel to Mandalay and other
                    cities more often. They are still very much controlled, however.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: John Scott Everton and Henry J. Byroade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Everton was very passive, a very low-key person, not too aggressive. He
                    flew the flag. He reminded me of some of the diplomats we had in Asia in the
                    late 19th century. I think he was connected with the Protestant missions prior
                    to his work with Foundations and the U.S. Government. Byroade is an ex- Air
                    Force General who built airfields near Kunming, China during WW II. A West Point
                    graduate in the Corps of Engineers, he was an excellent choice for the
                    assignment. He later went to Manila as Ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in 1965 and went where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: I have always had a tour back home after an overseas tour. I was put on
                    the Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos Desk. That was the beginning of a long and
                    complicated period when...my first job on the Desk was liaison with other
                    agencies. I worked with officers in CIA, DIA and the Security Council trying to
                    maintain some kind of continuity in the various programs that we were developing
                    to assist the Government of South Vietnam.</p>
                <p>At that early date no one knew what we were getting into. When you start on
                    Vietnam, from my point of view you have to start back in 1945. Then after Dien
                    Bien Phu we got involved...1954. Then, slowly, slowly we built up.</p>
                <p>When I started my assignment, there was still a reasonable amount of popular
                    support for what we were doing. No one at that time realized exactly what we
                    were getting into. Now this may sound like a little bit of horn tooting, but
                    after you have been four years in Taiwan; two years in Singapore, watching that
                    conflict between the locals; and up in Burma watching that conflict; some of us
                    knew that Vietnam was a powder keg. We knew then we were not going to win it.
                    There was no way we were ever going to go in there and structure a government
                    and army that is going to be solid enough to win the support of the people.</p>
                <p>Kennedy said he was going to pull troops out. Well, maybe Johnson would too. I
                    think Johnson has been pillaged on Vietnam. I have my own view on it. I think he
                    was misled. I don't think he would have done what he did if his lieutenants had
                    not told him that was the thing to do and that he would be a big hero if he did
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>My personal views aside, 1965 was the time of the big build-up and our job was to
                    get people there; lassoing people in halls trying to persuade them to go, trying
                    to get money, trying to get some consistency in policy, trying to execute the
                    directions received from the White House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So as liaison you were running around saying you said
                        this, they said this, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Well, there wasn't much time given as to whether it was good or bad. It
                    was a policy implementation phase rather than the development phase.</p>
                <p>In 1966, (sic. 1965) there was the bombing of the Embassy. That shattered the
                    Embassy structure so I was sent out on TDY, which lasted nine months, to help
                    out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a bomb set off at our old Embassy which killed
                        quite a few people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Yes. Again I had an “implementation” task. Here is the program, check
                    this, do that, go there, etc. There was no innovation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the situation seem any surprise to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Yes. I saw things that were said about Taiwan being said again. It was
                    Singapore again. It was China again. This whole lack of appreciation of the
                    history driving these cultures and subcultures. This is true throughout my
                    career in Asia, frankly. Malaysia and the Philippines come later. If you are
                    sensitive. If you can smell a united Germany in 1945...and you could smell
                    it...that is why you don't want to get into Bosnia. These conflicts do not react
                    well to military forces. Repel aggression yes. Slam the aggressor on the head
                    and get him out of the way, but not this sort of war, not intercultural
                    conflicts. You lose every time. Those involved don't want you there. If they
                    want to kill each other, they want to kill each other and they resent your going
                    in and trying to stop them from killing each other.</p>
                <p>Anyway, during my first stay in Vietnam, people would come to Saigon, programs
                    would come in, Congressmen would come in and need to be briefed. It was just
                    like pushing a button. You would give the spiel and they or it would go away.
                    And another would come in.</p>
                <p>I was able to leave there when my mother died. I came back and the Department
                    asked if I would like to go to the Philippines? Oh yes indeed. So in 1966 I went
                    out to the Philippines under Ambassador Blair.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>This is nice. The Philippines was our “colony”; in 1966 they were our colony. The
                    interesting thing going on in the Philippines, I guess, was again making sure
                    that the Philippines wouldn't get too far adrift from where we wanted them to
                    be...a strong right arm for our Southeast Asian policy and providing us with
                    what were then strategic bases, Subic Bay and Clark Field.</p>
                <p>President Johnson made a visit to Manila while I was there. It took two months
                    before his arrival to get ready and two months after he left were spent in
                    repairing the damage. This happens all the time in most Embassies and I am sure
                    you are familiar with it. That was one of the big events, the Johnson visit, and
                    trying to get the Philippines to support us in Vietnam. Manila wouldn't send
                    combat troops but they did send some rural reconstruction battalions there.</p>
                <p>Everything was going swimmingly and I had a two year assignment there. I asked
                    for a third and had it approved and then bang!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about the Tet offensive in Saigon, January,
                        1968.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Right. Well, I was directed back to Saigon but I don't want to go. I am
                    using all the chips I collected throughout my career trying to get the
                    assignment changed. No way. Your family can stay in Manila. You only have to go
                    for 18 months. They don't even have to move out of the house...it was a lovely
                    house. Everything is going to be fine. You can catch a flight from Saigon to
                    Clark and spend a weekend with your family. They knew I had spent quite a bit of
                    time there earlier and was not very sympathetic about Vietnam...not hostile, but
                    I would say, “let's recognize it.” I told them that I didn't want to go back
                    because we had lost it. Not go back? Okay I did.</p>
                <p>During this second assignment, I was Ambassador Bunker's special assistant. There
                    is much that I cannot say about this assignment, but my job was to work with the
                    Ambassador and his other assistants in his office in dealings with the senior
                    officials of the South Vietnamese government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Thieu, Ky, the prime ministers, industry leaders, etc.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: We were in a new building which was big.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sense a difference in the attitude of those
                        dealing...had Tet come as a shock to thinking or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Not really, because amongst the US faithful, Tet was a victory and it
                    truly was, militarily. The Communists took their best shot and didn't make it so
                    now we were going to start rolling them back. That really should have broken the
                    morale of the Communists. The VC did not conquer the South. Regular North
                    Vietnamese divisions conquered the South. It wasn't the people that failed, but
                    the corruption and deterioration of the Thieu government that we structured.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any impressions of how we operated at that
                        time? I mean the American style of operation in Vietnam...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Stu, I wasn't impressed. The military was given a mission and by God
                    nothing was going to change. They were going to do it, like Grant. I think,
                    frankly the Department as a whole had it right all the way along. People like
                    Marty Herz, and Berger and Bunker...these fellows tried awfully hard.
                    Westmoreland had his way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the general in command.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Right. Abrams, who followed, was more practical. McNamara, and to a
                    certain extent Rusk, just wouldn't give in. They were going to have it their
                    way. I remember one time going up to see a senior US official with an associate
                    and I said, “Can I tell it like I saw it?” My associate said, “It is kind of
                    dicey. I am going to tell you the policy right now, so don't go in there
                    swinging because you will be picking up your teeth.” There wasn't much leeway.
                    Again I am speaking about someone who was a very senior official at the time.
                    You did your job the best way you could seven days a week and sometimes 20 hours
                    a day. And thank God you were able to do so because you would go crazy if you
                    didn't. I literally wanted to work all the time, as did most others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Being away from the family...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Being away from the family, you don't want to think about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you get out of there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>KATROSH: After eighteen months I came back to the US. I did some work in East
                    Asian affairs. In late 1971, I was asked if I wanted to go to Kuala Lumpur. I
                    had been up to Kuala Lumpur while in Singapore and remembered it as a lovely</p>
                <p>town. So in 1972 I went to Kuala Lumpur and lived in probably the most famous
                    house there, Jalan Murchu, located on top of the highest point in Kenny Hill, a
                    suburb of Kuala Lumpur.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Malaysia then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: I was there for a three year tour. The big thing in Malaysia was the
                    formation of ASEAN, and oil. Q: This was the economic union of...?</p>
                <p>KATROSH: Association of Southeast Asian Nations. Malaysia, Singapore, Indonesia,
                    Philippines and Thailand to start with. Now Brunei is in the formal group.</p>
                <p>Very typically European diplomatic process to organize very productive and now
                    maturing Asian style democracies. Malaysia is the only country that successfully
                    contained an internal Communist armed uprising. By the time I got there the
                    uprising was over. When I was in Singapore, one of the big issues was the
                    Communist insurgents in Malaysia. We did a lot of work on that in the
                    Consulate.</p>
                <p>The United States government was doing what it could in terms of support,
                    diplomatic support, to put it down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was the British military..</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Well, yes. But the Malays too. Their leadership got on top of the
                    situation and said, “Damn it we are not going to give in to them.” They did an
                    awful lot of the hard work and they are justly proud of it. One is not in
                    Malaysia very long before being told they are the only country in Southeast Asia
                    which for the most part contained Communism on their own. The British and the
                    Aussies were in there to stiffen them and to train them. The British Special
                    Branch also did a lot of work, ferreting out the Communist leadership and that
                    sort of thing, but by and large, if the Malays didn't get with it, it wouldn't
                    have happened. It would have turned out like Vietnam - Cambodia. But the Malays
                    decided they wanted to get rid of the Communists as quickly as they could, and
                    they did.</p>
                <p>That was the difference between Malaysia and Burma. Malaysia kept the British
                    there about ten years after WW II to rebuild the superstructures, get the road
                    systems in, get the bridges in, get the universities operating, and then go. But
                    Burma, after the war, said, “Hey, we can run this thing, so go.” Of course they
                    couldn't but the British said, “Fine,” and went.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>During the early 1970 years we were winding down in Vietnam and Malaysia was very
                    concerned about this. When the Embassy in Vietnam was evacuated, a Malaysian
                    official came up to me...as a matter of fact the Foreign Minister, who was a
                    friend...and said, “Look, if you fellows weren't there, we would not have had
                    the ten years to build up the democracy we now have. The Chinese would have been
                    down our throat; we couldn't have contained the insurgency. You fellows took the
                    pressure off. Now I think we can make it on our own. Thank you very much and
                    don't feel so bad.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to say that I subscribe to this, although we did it
                        poorly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Nevertheless there were benefits.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was not a popular theme in the United States at this
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: I know, I quite agree. We did it poorly, but we did it poorly for
                    different reasons. Anyway these fellows said, “Thank goodness you were there.”
                    The officials whom I knew from Singapore days also said, “Don't feel badly. We
                    benefitted from it, you fellows didn't. You have your problems at home. You have
                    a terrible split in your social structure, but be happy that some good came out
                    of it.”</p>
                <p>In my own mind I think one of the reasons why we are one of the dialogue partners
                    in the ASEAN group, despite many mistakes, is because of our stand against
                    Communism in Southeast Asia. We still have an awful lot of influence in
                    Southeast Asia. Go in and give them the US point of view, try to point out the
                    options they have. By 1970 I think almost all of the Embassies in Southeast Asia
                    were operating this way.</p>
                <p>We had a little group in the early 1970s which would meet in Singapore, upper
                    level Embassy officers, about once every three months. We would talk about
                    Southeast Asian internal conflicts and send a report back to the Ambassadors
                    about what we discussed and what we concluded. It was very interesting. This was
                    the way the reports generally went. “We are on the right track. We shouldn't
                    insert ourselves into ABC situations. We should offer consultation or advice if
                    they want it and some help if we can afford it.” I think that paid off. It
                    certainly paid off in Malaysia.</p>
                <p>We have serious oil interests in Malaysia and I worked on oil issues. The
                    relationship between the oil companies and the Malaysia government were tough
                    and businesslike.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are talking about the time you were in Malaysia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>KATROSH: We worked on US interests as required. For example, the Malaysian
                    Foreign Minister came up with the idea for a Zone of Peace, Freedom and
                    Neutrality. We talk to him and say there is heavy conflict going on in Southeast
                    Asia, how about standing back. He said, “We want you here, just stay over the
                    horizon.”</p>
                <p>As noted earlier, another daily issue was theoil business. Exxon is very powerful
                    in Malaysia. Sometimes they get a little too uppity and the Malaysian government
                    grabs them by the nose and tweaks it a little bit. Exxon then gets upset. But
                    these events, from my point of view, were good events.</p>
                <p>After Vietnam one of the things the Malaysians wanted very quickly was a
                    Vietnamese Embassy in town. So there was that. They also were recognizing
                    Beijing at the time. Kuala Lumpur put an embassy in Beijing and Beijing people
                    were coming to Kuala Lumpur. Compared with all of my experiences in the Foreign
                    Service, the time in Kuala Lumpur was the most “traditional”; what I thought an
                    Embassy should be doing. We weren't fighting a war, we weren't shouting “These
                    dirty Communists are coming over the wall.” From 1972-75 you could see real
                    growth and progress and construction in bilateral relations. You could see
                    Southeast Asia coming into its own. The Thais began to think independently and
                    Jakarta was well under control in terms of US interests. The Southeast Asians
                    didn't vote with us half the time in the U.N. but when the chips were down and
                    we really needed their cooperation they gave it, and not reluctantly, they gave
                    it willingly.</p>
                <p>So I would say that if someone wanted to understand effective Asian diplomacy, if
                    they looked over the period 1970-1985 and see how the Embassies operated in that
                    part of the world, there would be some lessons to be learned.</p>
                <p>It was a great tour. The family liked it. My son was here in college, but my
                    daughter was with us. At the end of the tour I returned to Washington, back into
                    interagency liaison at a little higher level than before, but again working the
                    liaison circuit. The last 18 months of this home tour I did a little
                    Congressional relations. One day I was asked, “How would you like to go to Tel
                    Aviv?” Tel Aviv? I knew where it was on a map. I knew a little bit about Islam
                    because one of the countries I served in in Southeast Asia was very Islamic. I
                    grew up with a lot of good Jewish boys who are still my fast friends. But that
                    was about it.</p>

                <p>KATROSH: I went back to FSI...that is the nice thing about coming back home
                    between tours, one usually goes back to FSI to learn a little bit about this and
                    a little bit about that. I studied Hebrew for about three months. The idea was
                    not to learn Hebrew, but I knew, by that time in my career, that if you don't
                    understand the structure of the local language and a little bit about how your
                    hosts communicate amongst themselves, you are hopeless when it comes to trying
                    to understand the predilections of the society, the workings. I learned enough
                    Hebrew to be able to read road signs and find my way around up in the Golan and
                    places like that. Also some polite expressions to use with the government
                    officials I would be working with.</p>
                <p>We went off to Israel in 1978 for another three years, plus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the war was over and Camp David was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: ...was underway. November 1977 was, I think, when Sadat visited
                    Jerusalem. The operative war was in 1973, the October war. Much of what was
                    happening in 1977 was a result of the 1973 war.</p>
                <p>I am still very close to Israel and correspond with friends there. I may even
                    visit there this coming year again. But I must say that if it wasn't for Sadat's
                    visit to Jerusalem we wouldn't be having this peace conference now (1992). That
                    visit was one of the most imaginative moves on the part of world leaders
                    concerned with peace and stability in the Middle East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But Sadat had made his visit before...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: In 1977. But he set the opportunity for peace with Egypt. If he didn't
                    make this move, the Israelis would still be in the Sinai.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression...this was the Begin government
                        which was a right wing, very nationalist government beginning to go through
                        the peace process. You were the new boy on the block but you had this
                        different view not having been immersed in this. What was your impression of
                        our Embassy in Israel and how they related to the Israelis and how they also
                        saw the Egyptians?</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is April 13, 1993. Ralph, when did you get to Tel
                        Aviv?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: I arrived 1977 and left there in 1981.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you see the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Thinking about it, I would say the Embassy was structured with the idea
                    of balance in mind. One of the more difficult problems that both the Department
                    and the Ambassador faced in staffing the US Embassy in Israel was the religious
                    and cultural preferences of Embassy officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the American Embassy in Israel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Right. ...the issue of Jewish officers. That was very difficult. There
                    were historical preferences by some US administrations, in their words “to
                    appreciate the sensitivity of the religious issue, the emotional aspects of the
                    Jewish issue and an objective look at Jewish-American-Arab relations.” There was
                    a strong school of thought that believed senior Jewish officers could not be
                    totally objective. I didn't agree with this, but nonetheless for purposes of
                    historical accuracy there was a school of thought that held this view.</p>
                <p>What one found in the US Embassy in Tel Aviv when I arrived there was very senior
                    people were not Jewish. For example, the political section: the political
                    counselor was not a Jewish person. But under the political counselor was a staff
                    that was probably three-fourths Jewish—young Jewish Foreign Service officers who
                    were trained in Hebrew. The rapport that they were able to establish with the
                    community was a very good one, a very close one. In one or two instances, I must
                    say, their heritage, while not a problem, was something that they fought in
                    terms of trying to be totally objective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My understanding is that the Israelis as a policy put
                        tremendous pressure on anybody who was of Jewish ancestry to coop them in
                        one way or another.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>KATROSH: I wouldn't say that was government policy as such, but I would say that
                    there were factions within the Israeli government who wouldn't hesitate to do
                    that. Of course, the more religious or the more conservative the faction, the
                    more their tendency would be to try to pressure US officials who happened to be
                    Jewish. But I have to say that in my experience, and in reading the reporting,
                    and I read all the reporting of the Jewish political officers, I didn't detect
                    prejudice. Where I detected the struggle was from my own personal relationships
                    with some of them because I was very close to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the record, are you Jewish or not Jewish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: I am Catholic. Probably one of the reasons why I was picked for the job
                    was the fact that I wasn't Jewish. My predecessor in my particular position also
                    had not been Jewish. I believe I was sent there because I had absolutely no
                    attachment to any of the issues or any of the people involved. I reasoned that
                    if objectivity was the reason why I was sent there then that ought to be the
                    attitude I should continue to foster. So I tried to remain pretty pragmatic,
                    professional, and objective. But I also tried to understand why this particular
                    Jewish faction felt one way or that particular Jewish faction thought another
                    way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just want to make an aside here Ralph. My understanding
                        from doing a considerable amount of interviewing was that the major problem
                        was within the foreign affairs apparatus has not been the professional
                        Foreign Service officer who happens to speak Jewish. It is the political
                        appointees who are Jewish or have been involved in politics where the
                        constituency was heavily Jewish and come into the Department and have
                        brought all their pro-Israeli proclivities. They don't bother to lose them
                        because they aren't really professionals.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Well there are two aspects to that. Firstly, in all the time that I
                    served in the Embassy or my historical references to my predecessors, they were
                    all professionals. Sam Lewis was and is a professional. His predecessor is a
                    professional and his successor is a professional. The political counselors were
                    all young professionals. The attach�s were professionals. So at the Embassy
                    level they were professionals. Not that they didn't develop certain preferences,
                    but they were professional officers.</p>
                <p>At the Department level, I would say that the political factor and the Jewish
                    preferences played a bigger role. I think you can see it even today. The
                    differences to the approach of the Palestinian/Jewish/Syrian/Jordanian issue is
                    different than what it was six months ago because of the orientation of the
                    policy groups in the Department. Now I don't know how that translates out to the
                    Embassy in Tel Aviv. I can't tell. I have been reading very closely what the
                    Ambassadors have to say about the current round of peace talks and I must say
                    the Embassy seems not to be involved in this political/Jewish factor.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Thinking about this interview over a couple of weeks, I also have to say that
                    what really happens in US/Middle East relations (both Israeli and Arab) at least
                    as far as I can tell from the Embassy in Tel Aviv, and from what I read in the
                    Jewish press, which I still read religiously, and my correspondence with people
                    in Israel, I would have to say that the real issues were addressed not at the
                    professional, diplomatic level, but at the senior political level. From what I
                    can see, more and more of the functions at the Embassy are support of policy
                    rather than having any real significant input on what policy should be. Fellows
                    like Rabin, Sharon, Shamir, Peres don't pay too much attention to what the
                    Ambassador says in terms of something other than a regular message because they
                    know they have their own channels to the political structure here, good or bad,
                    Republican or Democrat. They have their own way of getting their message
                    through. They look on Embassy Tel Aviv, I think, more and more as an implementor
                    rather than as an influence on policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to the 1977-80 period. What were the issues
                        that would on the reporting? Here is a kaleidoscope of parties, political
                        activity in a very small country where everybody was in spitting distance of
                        everybody else. How did you sort this out and were there problems in
                        reporting as far as concern about what would happen to reports once they got
                        back to Washington. We are talking about this period of time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Back in that period of time I think every report that left the Embassy,
                    whoever wrote it, because of the intense political movement or peace
                    negotiations at the time was written for consumption at the highest level. I
                    must say that with rare exceptions, I think it was pretty honest, objective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, am I correct, the normal political life, no matter
                        where it goes you can write about that. The real crux was, wasn't it, how
                        were the Israelis treating the Arabs both in the West Bank, Gaza, etc?.
                        Wasn't that the real problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Well, yes and no. That is the real problem then and now. But if you are
                    talking about that time, the real problem was how do you take advantage of the
                    opening for some break in Arab-Israeli relations. That was what those four years
                    were all about, which led to Camp David. Don't forget just prior to 1977 the
                    Labor Government was in power and there was a very set policy in the Labor Party
                    on the territories issue and it is very similar today. It hasn't changed very
                    much at all in fifteen years. As a matter of fact I venture to say that it
                    hasn't changed.</p>
                <p>Then you had the Begin factions. The Likuds were put in for a variety of reasons.
                    They have and still have a different view on how to settle this occupied
                    territory issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>At the same time you had President Carter who saw an opportunity to do something
                    in the Middle East. He wanted to get Geneva Conference going again for a lot of
                    reasons. He planned to have the Russians there and this was going to help a
                    little bit with the US-Russian relationship. Everybody knew that the Israelis
                    had their own lines to the Arabs and there were a few meetings over in Morocco
                    that encouraged everybody about flexibility between the Israelis and the Arabs
                    sponsored by the king there. In a separate meeting with Sadat, Carter determined
                    there was a possibility of doing something. So all of the other factors, which
                    continued to influence it around the edges...they are not insignificant or
                    small...but everything focused on how to get the peace process going and how do
                    we get a crack in the total Arab-Israeli issues...Palestine being part of it and
                    Syria/Lebanon being another part of it.</p>
                <p>Carter originally thought Geneva was the way to get the Russians in and then the
                    Syrians will come in. As the preparations for Geneva came up there was the
                    problem of intra-Arab relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to keep this down to your level.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Well, this is what the reporting was focused on. The strategic
                    issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you and our Embassy looking at the Begin
                        government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Shamir and Sharon were minority views in the Begin government. They
                    weren't that much involved in making Israeli policy, frankly. Shamir voted
                    against the Camp David Accord which was sponsored by Begin. They were the very
                    conservative fringe, milling around within the Likud coalition.</p>
                <p>I would say from my understanding of the reporting, the issue was Begin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view Begin? I have heard it said that Begin
                        really didn't rise to the occasion that Sadat offered. An opportunity was
                        missed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Well, an opportunity for what? If you look at it from an American point
                    of view, from an Israeli point of view, from an Egyptian point of view, there
                    were opportunities for all three of them. Begin was conservative and he was the
                    leader of the conservative party. The conservative party then, and now, doesn't
                    want to give up territory, particularly the Golan West Bank and, I guess Gaza,
                    but this latter point is debatable. But the Sharon/Shamir factions within the
                    Likud wouldn't have even given up the Sinai. “Why should we give up the Sinai?
                    We gave it back once and they kicked our butt, so we are going to keep it.”</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>Number two, as far as Begin is concerned, you can't really understand the Israeli
                    psyche without understanding the holocaust. You just can't do it. Now I know
                    that people get tired of hearing this, just like some get tired of these
                    “bleeding blacks.” Nonetheless, 6 million people were killed because of their
                    ethnic and religious preferences. It is very difficult...I don't know if it is
                    possible for one to understand if he hasn't lived with these people for a
                    certain length of time, who hasn't been in off-the-record situations in citrus
                    orchards, in the desert, or over a bottle of beer in Jerusalem; they really
                    forget you are a non-Jew. They forget and let it all hang out. It is only then
                    that you realize how deeply the psyche of this country and this government is
                    influenced by history. And it is not that long ago. Begin was a victim, a lot of
                    people who are still in the government were kicked around by the Poles, the
                    Russians, the Czechs, the Slovaks, the Austrians, the Germans, some by the
                    Americans, and that hurts. It is all very personal. I don't know what it is now
                    with the influx of the Russians, but I hope to find out, but every one of these
                    people are post 1945...all of the leadership...and most of them remember, they
                    were young children. So when you talk about Begin and his reluctance to give up
                    territory in the face of a Palestinian policy which says we are going to throw
                    you right back into the sea, what do you expect him to do?</p>
                <p>In some respects, I can understand if the Israelis said, “Screw you all.” Their
                    war of independence was fought with Communist weapons. The basic instinct of the
                    old Central European Israeli is Communist. And that instinct coupled with their
                    religious orientation and the holocaust experience is tough. For an Israeli like
                    Rabin to get up and say, “Well, maybe I will make a deal with Syria.” Oh my
                    God.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's go back to the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: So when Sadat made his move...Sadat made his move for a couple of
                    reasons. I think he saw Carter as an objective leader. Carter isn't going to
                    take sides. He is not going to be terribly pro-Arab, but he is not going to be
                    terribly pro-Israeli. He wasn't, and he paid for it, let's face it. Israelis
                    don't like Carter. Sadat's big card was that in all of the Israeli claims of
                    homeland, Sinai was never included. So he figures, “I can get back all the
                    Egyptian sand without coming up against this historical, biblical, emotional
                    barrier that the Israelis have with the other Arabs. Therefore I don't want to
                    go to Geneva because all the other Arabs are going to be there. And the Russians
                    are going to be there. I threw the Russians out. What am I going to get there?
                    But if I can make a separate deal...I am powerful enough... [don't forget Egypt
                    is the key to Arab unity against Israel]...I am powerful enough, my country is
                    powerful enough, that I don't have to worry about these other Arabs coming after
                    me. I can get back the Sinai and I can even get the Israeli settlements out of
                    there if I try hard enough. I will try to include the Palestinians and make sure
                    the record reads that the issue was discussed, but I am not going to wait for
                    that issue to be solved.” Hussein is now (1993) thinking more like Sadat
                    did.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Begin reasons: “Okay. If I can split the Arabs then if ever the time comes to
                    deal with the Syrians on the Golan and the Palestinians, I do not have to worry
                    about Egypt. Egypt is going to be out of the picture in terms of territorial
                    negotiations. I don't have to worry about a serious two front war like I did in
                    1973 when I almost lost it all. So I get Egypt isolated and then I get the
                    Americans to cooperate because they want this arrangement.” So there were a lot
                    of pluses and Begin was...Begin's reluctance in the early years of Camp David
                    negotiations, was not so much the Sinai but to make damn sure that none of the
                    other Arab issues, particularly the Palestinian issue, was included. The
                    occupied territories were mentioned as a subject for future negotiations only at
                    the insistence of President Carter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again going back to this time, how did you and your
                        colleagues in the political section view the Palestinians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: I was wondering when you were going to get to that. There were two
                    schools of thought in the Embassy on the Palestinian issue. This was one of the
                    places where maybe I have a disagreement with Ambassador Sam Lewis. The Israelis
                    are a very engaging people. It is a wonderful country to live in. Not that it is
                    high society or high class living, but it is nice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Everybody who I have interviewed likes it because...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: The weather is good, you kick a stone and you uncover 5,000 years of
                    history. Your mind is always going. No wonder the Jews are considered a very
                    intelligent people. You walk on a beach and you pick up Roman coins and glass.
                    You see crusader castles and you see places like Hatzor which is five thousand
                    BC. In the villages you can sit and kind of figure out how the history of
                    Christianity worked out.</p>
                <p>This also intoxicates ambassadors. The Israelis are very warm people in terms of
                    inviting you to their homes. Everybody gets involved in Israeli society.
                    Everybody gets to know really what a bar mitzvah is all about. Everybody gets to
                    know what the Holy Sepulcher is all about. Everybody gets to know about the Dome
                    of the Rock and Mohammed's going up to heaven on a horse. Your mind is filled
                    with all of this and you realize the complexities of the situation. So you grow
                    to like the all people in a very real way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Will you explain 242 and 338?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>KATROSH: Well, 242 and 338 have to do with the Palestinian homeland. These are
                    the UN resolutions that deal with Palestinian history in Israel. If you are
                    totally objective about this, the solution for Israel at that time...the
                    international position was that Israel has to go back to the 1967 borders with a
                    little adjustment here and there for security. Now if you are going to say,
                    “What are the Palestinian rights in terms of the international record?” 242 and
                    338 e.g. return of the land and return of the Palestinian exiles. But no US
                    ambassador in my memory has really insisted on that, i.e. the settlements, for
                    example. All settlements in occupied territory are supposed to be illegal, but
                    the US has acquiesced in the building of settlements without vigorous protest.
                    Whenever some wag in the Department would try to raise the settlement issue,
                    i.e. the Palestinian issue, or the water issue, or land ownership issue, or even
                    the political rights issue, the Embassy was never too interested in getting
                    involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the question of settlements, land issues...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: No one wanted to talk about it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: No one in the Embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There must have been some young officer who would get up
                        and say...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Well, every once in a while somebody would say something about it, but
                    right away, it was off the table.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am surprised because Embassies normally have two groups.
                        You have the more senior officers who know what the policy is because they
                        don't want to fight battles they don't have to fight. And you got the young
                        officers feeling their oats, etc., who are picking up the more contentious
                        issues. I would think the Palestinian issues would be just the sort of thing
                        these young officers would bring up. Why weren't they? This is going against
                        human foreign service nature.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>KATROSH: I have served in six embassies and I agree with you. There were a couple
                    of other issues. For example, when we give military equipment to a foreign
                    country there are all kinds of restrictions placed on its use. Now in the
                    Israeli/Lebanon situation, on a number of occasions the Israelis used American
                    equipment contrary to the rules and regulations which we put on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are talking about when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Yes. The military people would sometimes try to make an issue out of
                    that, but if it got out of the Embassy, and it sometimes did, it never
                    stimulated action at the policy level in Washington. So the settlement issue is
                    the same. No one wanted to talk about those issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am sorry to keep dwelling on this, but I find it so
                        against nature...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Well, in most embassies I have to admit that the tough issues that you
                    don't want to talk about are usually raised by energetic young officers. In
                    Israel, the energetic young officers didn't think the settlement issue was an
                    issue to raise for reasons I have already given you. If you have five out of
                    seven political officers at the junior level at the Embassy who are being rigid
                    about their objectivity, but having a struggle with that rigidity, they aren't
                    going to look for issues that are going to make their life more difficult and
                    miserable. Now the officers up in Jerusalem, in the Consulate, were of a
                    different stripe. I wasn't up there, but I read their reporting. They would
                    raise the issue. They would jump up and down over abuse of Arabs. Sometimes
                    there would be smarts remarks made about the Arab-loving guys in the Consulate
                    in Jerusalem.</p>
                <p>But as far as serious pressure to emphasize the abuses of the settlement issues,
                    for example, or water use...now water is something I knew something about. I had
                    done some work in the Department the Middle East water issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the water issue at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Well, everything that comes down to “the Sea of Galilee is Israeli.” So
                    many cubic meters of water come down the Jordan and you have some Arabs on one
                    side. They have wells and want the water to seep into them. The Israelis would
                    pipe the water around a settlement and pump it into an area further along. It is
                    the distribution of the available water. Naturally the Israelis favored their
                    own.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there ever the feeling that maybe in the future the
                        Palestinians could coalesce into a state, and could live in peace with
                        Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Did the Palestinians ever feel this?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I am talking about how you felt about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Oh, sure. And there are a lot of Israelis who feel the same way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I am talking about you and your officers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Yes, many of them. I would say the majority felt that the solution to
                    the specific Palestinian was not hopeless.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we avoiding looking at how the Israelis were treating
                        the Arabs in the West Bank and in Gaza?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Well, at that time it wasn't nearly the way it is now. The Begin
                    government had a live-let-live policy for a lot of reasons. My wife and I went
                    up to all the Arab villages on a regular basis. So did my Israeli colleagues.
                    There wasn't the community antagonism to the point there is now.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, some of the PLO, the more fanatic members of the Fatah, would
                    creep into Israel and put a bomb down in a marketplace. More than once my wife
                    was shopping and “boom” the tomato bin goes up and people got hurt, and
                    sometimes killed. But that was unusual. It always happened on Thursday. We
                    learned after a few weeks in Israel not to go to the market on Thursday because
                    the Palestinians were out there chasing the Shabbat shoppers. (Shabbat: The
                    Israeli Sabbath which starts Friday at sunset.)</p>
                <p>And then there was harassment up on the border. Every once in a while the
                    Palestinians would fire a few rockets on Israeli towns and the Israelis would
                    send the Israeli Air Force to bomb the rocket positions or some PLO bunkers.
                    There was an awful lot of this...you are in an area that I worked on very
                    closely with the Israelis... and that was the issue of infiltration of
                    terrorists. We all worked very hard...sometimes with Arab officials when it was
                    a particularly bad situation...to stop the infiltration of PLO hit teams coming
                    from Lebanon and shooting up Israeli villages and taking hostages, etc. But it
                    wasn't like it is now (1993) with “Let's kill all the Arabs.” As long as I was
                    there, I don't ever remember any shutdown of Arab workers coming into Israel.
                    Israel's agriculture and industry couldn't have existed without them and there
                    is a question as to whether they can even today.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>In Israel at the Allenby Bridge, there would be 50 Arab trucks with Israeli
                    produce waiting in line to go over to Jordan and from there they go to Amman
                    where the cargo gets transferred to other trucks. Sometimes they don't even do a
                    good job pasting Arab labels over the Israeli labels on the crates. Often the
                    produce would go up to Damascus.</p>
                <p>Most Arabs don't like the Palestinians. They didn't then and they don't now. Arab
                    leaders have never really done much for the Palestinians. Look at Assad. He was
                    no different then. He was always trying to split the PLO in those days, and he
                    is still trying to split them. He doesn't even talk to them. There are more
                    Israelis talking to the PLO than Syrians. And, everyone knows this. There is
                    always this feeling that if we could only get the Palestinians to accept
                    something less than this militant Palestinian State, something could be worked
                    out. Many Israelis think they can do business together because the Palestinians
                    are good business people. They are the most educated of the Arabs; great
                    doctors, lawyers and entrepreneurs. They are energetic and, I think, an
                    exception to the greater Arab society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way sort of the Jews of the Arab society.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Right. Left to their own they, Jews and Palestinians, could get along. I
                    believe a majority, small to be sure, of the Israelis felt and probably still
                    feel that way. But, going back to what I said earlier, without understanding the
                    holocaust and the psyche of the Israelis, you can't...you have to appreciate the
                    fact that the Israelis will say, “We don't want a Palestinian state. Not on my
                    mother's grave.” But he didn't say that this applies to his son. “Let's get an
                    autonomous situation. Let them manage their water, we will do that, we will do
                    this. However, the one thing we are not going to give them is state sovereignty.
                    And, after all, the bible says this is our land anyway, so we are doing them a
                    favor.”</p>
                <p>I am sure the modern Palestinian leadership, then and now, believe if they can
                    get a reasonably, well-defined, autonomous status, then over time a political
                    state will evolve...and it will, if they want one. The Palestinians may not want
                    one twenty years from now.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The reason I am asking is because shortly thereafter in
                        1981 they went into Lebanon. In an interview I did with our American
                        Ambassador there, Bob Dillon, he got a couple of impressions...Basically
                        they were quite ill-disciplined, fire discipline. They would shoot at
                        anything. They had a lot of ammunition. A lot of people died, civilians, who
                        happened to get in their way. A lot of looting. Obviously fighting in the
                        Sinai there was nothing to loot or in the Judean desert or in the
                        Golan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: I was still there for a little bit of that and I stayed very, very close
                    to that situation when I got back here. Firstly, this was a foreign war for the
                    Israelis in their eyes. Their army wasn't trained to fight a foreign type war.
                    They were trained to fight in the Sinai and in the Judean desert and fighting
                    armies with fire power was the way you balanced out. The Arabs have a lot more
                    troops than the Israelis. What the Israelis decided and pursued very vigorously
                    is the way you balance things out is to overwhelm your enemy with fire arms.
                    This is compatible with their history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually it was an American doctrine too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Well, it still is. Look what we did in Iraq.And civilians getting
                    killed. How about Dresden; how about Frankfurt. Look, war is war. It's not play
                    time.</p>
                <p>Secondly, Israel was split over the 1981/1982 war in Lebanon. It was a very
                    unpopular war. Even Begin felt, and I am thoroughly convinced of this, although
                    people will argue with me, that because of the Arab atrocities, particularly the
                    Hezbollah at that time coming over the border, Israel had to go about 14
                    kilometers into Lebanon. The idea was to stop well short of Beirut and clean the
                    area out. But then Sharon, who was Defense Minister at that time, said, “This is
                    a chance to really cuff the PLO.” So Begin was doing one thing and sending out
                    signals to do one thing but Sharon was saying, “Bomb the bastards in Beirut.” So
                    there was a serious conflict of leadership. If you get a conflict like this
                    between the President and the military commander-in-chief, you are going to have
                    what appears to be a lack of discipline within the troop fighting on the
                    ground.</p>
                <p>Thirdly, as far as looting is concerned, I don't know. I would say that the
                    Israeli enlisted men, particularly the good ones, aren't that far away from
                    David and Samson. I mean their instinct...just like the Arabs loot. Look what
                    Arabs (Iraqis) did in Kuwait. The instinct of those people, that Semitic
                    approach, is “Man, when you are in there, you are in there. If you rape, steal,
                    loot, that is part of the program.” Nonetheless, I cannot believe Israeli
                    soldiers raped.</p>
                <p>I sometimes wonder if that same Middle East approach to the vanquished is not
                    responsible for some of the actions in Bosnia today. It gets endemic in these
                    ethnic and tribal groups and the Israelis are not that much different. This is
                    what happened in Lebanon.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how Sam Lewis dealt with the
                        Israelis, his mindset and how he ran the Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Very professional in terms of the Embassy. It was a joy to work with
                    him. In terms of what he wanted, what his DCM was supposed to do...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The DCM was who?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Dick Viets and then Brown.</p>
                <p>My relationship with Sam was good. I knew exactly what he wanted. With Sam you
                    have to convince him you are a professional, that goes for anyone on the staff.
                    You have to persuade Sam that you can do your job and he need not have to
                    constantly be checking up on you. He always wished to be thoroughly briefed on
                    everything. Then Sam would let you go to it. That is the ambassador running the
                    team.</p>
                <p>I worked with him frequently with Israeli groups and I have to say when we were
                    working officially, he was perfect from my point of view. He was totally
                    objective and followed his instructions. Very tough sometimes. On the other
                    hand, I think Sam respected the Israelis for what they did with the country and
                    the potential...don't forget the Cold War was going on...and what they could do
                    for US interests. I believe he would give them the benefit of the doubt. He was,
                    at times, a little questioning concerning the views of the US ambassadors in
                    Arab countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that is part of the dynamics which I find
                        fascinating. I have talked with a number of the ambassadors from the other
                        side and they question Lewis' objectivity on this thing. You can't help
                        it...who you are is where you sit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: I do think that you shouldn't leave a man in there as long as Sam was
                    because he gets vested interests in the community and the people. You can't help
                    it. I don't think any person should serve more than four years at any post.
                    That's the maximum.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Yes.</p>

                        of a few people to really sort of scream.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: He did. Viets was very much a professional.</p>

                        strip away the verbiage it was a seizure of land.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Unfortunately, I don't think the Embassy was tough enough on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Israel always had its fingers in Beirut, particularly in those years. It
                    was a proxy war with Syria. The Christians up in Lebanon were being supplied by
                    the Israelis and the Muslims and everybody else would get their...the PLO wasn't
                    getting it from anyone except what they purchased...help from the Soviets a
                    little bit, and the Syrians. All these factions fought amongst themselves, plus,
                    without any discipline in the country to control the various terrorist groups,
                    the Fatah, the Hezbollah and the Palestine Liberation Front, a whole gaggle of
                    them were running terrorist operations against Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is right up by the Lebanese border.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Yes, right up to the “Good Fence. There also were and are a lot of
                    Lebanese coming over to Israel to work. They used to call it the good fence
                    because Lebanese crossed it to go to work and then to return home. The Israelis
                    reasoned: “Why do we have to put up with...there are a lot of Lebanese who
                    support us, we are supporting a lot of Lebanese, particularly the Christians, so
                    why do we have to put up with these awful acts by the terrorists?We will
                    establish a buffer zone. Go up there and take the land and of course we will get
                    a little water...we will have a surrogate Lebanese force.”</p>
                <p>The US hemmed and hawed, coughed a little bit, but realizing...I don't know why
                    Washington...the Embassy in Israel wasn't going to do terribly much, but
                    Washington didn't do anything either.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>I think there was a school of thought back here...and they were wrong and were
                    told they were wrong...who felt that one possibility for Middle East movement
                    would be to get a sympathetic government in Lebanon which would make its peace
                    with Israel. This is Shultz in the early days of the Reagan Administration. “How
                    can we turn the Lebanese situation to our advantage? We will sponsor peace.”
                    This thinking started during this particular cross border operation. It didn't
                    upset the Lebanese government in Beirut too much, even though it was a
                    Muslim/Christian government at that time, because they weren't controlling
                    anything in the southern border zone anyway. They figured if the Israelis can
                    get a couple of Lebanese to handle security, this gets the Israelis off our
                    backs...But Beirut didn't figure the Israeli government was as serious as it was
                    to gain something for all the support they had given to the Christians in
                    northern Lebanon. A lot of material went up there...tanks, guns, money,
                    training, etc.</p>
                <p>The United States figured that maybe we could make the Christian faction work for
                    us. Washington banked too much on what the Israelis told them was the art of the
                    possible with the Christians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any dissent in the Embassy at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Yes, there were some people who had the advantage of good intelligence,
                    but you couldn't persuade anyone that was the case, including many
                    “intelligence” people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking about intelligence, again this is an unclassified
                        interview, how did we view Israeli intelligence? Again like the Israeli army
                        this is considered to be the best intelligence service in the world, etc. At
                        the same time the Egyptians were able to launch a surprised attack on them
                        in 1973. Did we see it as a friend or adversary because we were having...I
                        am not sure if the Pollard case had come up at that time...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Oh, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...but it was well known that if we sent something into
                        Washington that probably the Israeli Ambassador and the Israeli Foreign
                        Minister had it on their desks before it probably reached the Secretary of
                        State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: That is an interesting question. Let me take care of the last one first
                    because that I think is the easiest one. That wasn't because the Israelis had
                    that effective a penetration of the US government, it was the US political
                    leadership who would pass it to them. After all, Israel is our buddy and votes
                    are votes.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>As far as I could determine from the information available to me, the Israelis
                    were quite good on some aspects of intelligence, particularly on the Soviet
                    Union. From what people tell me, many were not that impressed with Israeli
                    intelligence on the Arabs. They were good, but they weren't supermen. Sometimes
                    the Israelis came up with good information but they also came up with a lot of
                    their point of view information. Their analysis reflected their prejudices just
                    like ours often reflect US prejudices. I don't know anyone who thought the
                    Israelis were supermen. They were good, but they also made mistakes. They were
                    competent, but nothing special. I think the whole political establishment would
                    say that they were very good at responding to terrorism, and that is where they
                    get the reputation. Somebody hijacks a plane and the special forces go get it
                    back. But that is not intelligence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would they be particularly good at getting things out
                        of the Soviet Union?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Like with the Arabs, Israel always had good connections with the
                    Soviets. Don't forget the basic power structure of the Russian Communist
                    Party...lots of Jews were in the Party leadership. The person who developed the
                    Soviet nuclear bomb was a Jew. And there was some travel back and forth. Labor
                    and Likud party leaders were always in Romania. Israel didn't have an Embassy
                    there, but they had an office that looked like an Embassy, worked like an
                    Embassy and ate like an Embassy. This is intelligence, I guess, but it isn't
                    intelligence in the sense that we think it is. It is connections, influence,
                    etc. However, there is one qualification, in technical intelligence they were
                    very good. But then that is a fall out from their education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is a definition of technical intelligence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Using your technology to acquire information rather than human
                    sources.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Listening devices?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Well, not so much listening devices, but sophisticated electronic
                    communication systems. But any country with a good technical basis is good at
                    this sort of collection. Even countries that don't have a large technical base
                    are very good, like China. They also are like the Iranians who took the burn bag
                    out of the US Embassy, sat down and pieced the shredded paper all together.</p>

                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>KATROSH: The Israeli military had and have very little respect for the Iraqi
                    soldiers. As far as the Soviet Union is concerned, they, as I said earlier...it
                    was my impression that they...of course, remember the Khrushchev speech, the
                    Israelis were the first ones to get their hands on that.</p>

                <p>KATROSH: With all their connections they had good access and knew what was going
                    on because more than half of Israel in those years consisted of Central European
                    or Russian immigrants. In Israel you eat Central European or Russian food. So
                    they were valuable. If you get a Soviet who is a Jew who is working on something
                    that is as sophisticated as a nuclear weapon, you know...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Last question on this Israeli thing, it has been assumed
                        for several decades that the Israelis who got nuclear weapons tucked away
                        which, if push come to shove, that the Arab capitals around there will go
                        down the drain too with nuclear attacks. Was the nuclear situation in Israel
                        sort of one of those no-no topics as far as trying to raise it?</hi>
                </p>

                    will never forget a remark made to me by a senior decision maker in the Israeli
                    government. We got into a discussion about what the Israelis could do if push
                    came to shove?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about an all out assault.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: I said Israel could be overwhelmed if they, the Arabs, all got together,
                    or something like that. The Israeli said something like, “I assure you we will
                    never let that happen. We will never let it come to that.” I knew this man well
                    enough, we worked together closely, what he was really telling me was, “We will
                    nuke the bastards.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that has always been the assumption.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: He didn't say that but that is what I heard.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in May 1981. Were you there at the beginning of
                        the Israeli invasion of Lebanon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: I left just before, but I was still involved with things Israeli when
                    the invasion occurred.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the view of that in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: The view was that there wasn't going to be much said about it if it
                    didn't go too far. But when the Israelis reached Beirut, we knew that it was
                    going to tear apart any chance we had of doing anything with the peace process.
                    This was when the Republicans came in. They made that assessment. I think they
                    assessed the fact that if George Shultz got out there and talked to both the
                    Arab and Israeli and Lebanese, he could get some sort of peace agreement between
                    the Israeli government and Lebanese government. That was a big mistake. It was a
                    very serious mistake and Lebanon has yet to recover from it.</p>
                <p>Every administration, and this one is going to be the same, unfortunately, fails
                    to recognize historical, tribal, ethnic forces. Shultz works out a deal between
                    Lebanese Christians and Israel and takes it up to Damascus and expects the
                    Syrians to buy it. Well, the Syrians said no. That was the end of that. It was a
                    failure. The whole Lebanese policy in those early Reagan years was a disaster.
                    The Administration didn't know what they were dealing with. In my own mind, I
                    think the Israelis pulled a fast one on Reagan, Shultz and the Washington
                    establishment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There has always been the story that Sharon felt he got a
                        wink from Haig before launching the attack...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: He may have. I don't know. I was there when Haig went through Israel. He
                    had some weird ideas about what the art of the possible was. Haig saw the
                    Soviets as the big threat and he was going to line up the Israelis as well as
                    the Arabs. That was just a pipe dream. Haig was never too careful about how he
                    put things, from my point of view. I think if Sharon got a wink, it would have
                    had to have been that kind of wink. But Haig telling Sharon to go ahead and do
                    it, I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Haig may not even realized he had made a
                        wink.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Maybe he didn't and Sharon says “This fellow isn't really a diplomat and
                    I can say he did and get away with it because he is loose enough with his
                    vocabulary to say something like that. So I can just say it and make people
                    believe it.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you left Israel and basically this is enough, is that
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATROSH: Well, it was not enough of Israel, but as far as I am concerned you
                    leave the party while you are still sober and everyone is saying, “Hang around,
                    don't go, we are having a good time.” My view is that is when you should
                    leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then I think we will call this off.</hi>
