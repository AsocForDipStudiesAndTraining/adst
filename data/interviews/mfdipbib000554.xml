                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have the privilege of being in Mr. John Irwin's office
                        in Rockefeller Center and I am about to interview him primarily about his
                        experiences as ambassador to France. We will touch on other things, and with
                        no more ado the first question that my colleagues at Georgetown University
                        have asked me to touch on Mr. Ambassador, is what in your life propelled you
                        to want to be of service in the foreign service field, in international
                        affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IRWIN: Partly historical interests and partly good luck. My first government
                    service was truly in the army. I had a reserve commission from college and was
                    called to active duty in 1941, in September. It was for one year, but ended up
                    for almost five years, four years of which was essentially in the Pacific. I was
                    sent to Australia in March of 1942 and came home from Tokyo in 1946. I was
                    always grateful to have been sent to the Pacific because I had been to Oxford
                    after Princeton in my early life so I had seen something of Europe, but I had no
                    experience in Asia. So Australia, New Guinea, Philippines, Borneo and Japan made
                    a most interesting war. War is never good, but as wars go I have to say I had an
                    interesting one. Coming back from the war I started practicing law, which I
                    studied before the war with a firm, Davis, Polk, Wardwell, Sunderland and
                    Kiendl, whose other names have undoubtedly changed, but the Davis, Polk
                    remains.</p>
                <p>One of my friends in the Pacific, particularly in the Philippines, was a partner
                    of Davis, Polk. We had gotten to know each other there and he invited me to come
                    into Davis, Polk as an associate, which I did. Shortly thereafter he was
                    appointed as a commissioner on a joint Philippine finance commission and asked
                    me if I would join their staff since I had been in the Philippines quite a bit.
                    I did and we spent six months in the Philippines and that was my first
                    government job really, other than the army which one dose not truly count. That
                    was for the Treasury Department, it was a staff job for this commission. The
                    commission was ultimately responsible for various recommendations on the
                    financial life of the Philippines, how the United States might help, and was
                    instrumental in establishing what became the Central Bank of the
                    Philippines.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Following that I always had in the back of my mind the desire to sometime go into
                    the government, not necessarily to the foreign service world, but into the
                    government. Some years passed and I left Davis, Polk and joined Patterson,
                    Belknap and Webb at the invitation of Judge Patterson, who had come from being
                    Secretary of the Army back to civilian life. Unfortunately he was killed in an
                    air crash in 1951, just at the height of his career. He had been a federal
                    judge, Secretary of the Army, he had been in the army in World War I, started in
                    the army in World War II and was in a boot camp up in New York state when he was
                    called in to be Assistant Secretary of the Army, later becoming Secretary.</p>
                <p>First I felt it was important to become a partner in my firm so you had a firm
                    base on which to live and to come back to if you went into the government. I was
                    fortunate to become a partner in Patterson, Belknap in 1950 and I remained
                    working in the law until 1957 — through the Truman administration and through
                    the first Eisenhower administration. Being essentially a Republican, although I
                    have voted for Democrats, I thought the second Eisenhower administration might
                    be a very good time to go into the government, if I could find a position. So I
                    let known to some friends that I was interested in working for the government.
                    Just by good fortune Mansfield Sprague, who was Assistant Secretary for
                    International Security Affairs in the Defense Department, wanted a deputy
                    assistant secretary. A couple of friends recommended me to him, I went down and
                    talked with him and left the law for that particular post. Manny Sprague left
                    the government a year later or so and at that time I became Assistant Secretary
                    of ISA and remained there until President Kennedy was elected in 1961.</p>
                <p>At that time I thought that ISA was the best job in Washington. It handled all of
                    the foreign affairs of the Defense Department and worked very closely with State
                    on all overseas matters. All the international agreements, they all effected
                    Defense in one way or another, particularly at NATO and even CENTO at that time.
                    I was also fortunate in being the one from the Defense Department who was
                    invited to travel the Secretary of State when he went somewhere. He took several
                    of his own staff and one person from the Pentagon, and it seemed to be the ISA
                    was the one to follow him. It was again my fortune to go with Mr. Dulles quite a
                    few times. In those days it was a four - prop airplane, very comfortable, but it
                    slept ten people, so Secretary Dulles restricted his group to ten, that included
                    himself, Mrs. Dulles usually, his secretary, then depending on where he was
                    going it would be a different composition. Usually he took, in his case, a legal
                    advisor, he took the assistant secretary for the area to which he was going,
                    often he would take the desk officer of the particular country he was going to
                    or the area and then sometimes the deputy under secretary for political or
                    economic affairs, depending on the trip. That was always interesting and fun, we
                    did work on the airplane, but on the other hand after you had done the work Mr.
                    Dulles would often say, “well I have done enough work, I would like to play
                    bridge”. I enjoyed playing bridge, there were four of us, including Mr. Dulles,
                    who would play bridge before we slept on the airplane. That of course enhanced
                    my interest in the government and the great benefits that one learned while
                    working in the government so that when I returned to private law practice at
                    Patterson, Belknap and Webb in 1961 I knew I would always be interested if an
                    opportunity came to work again in the government.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>That opportunity came in 1963, I think it was. President Johnson had asked the
                    former Secretary of the Treasury, Robert Anderson, to negotiate with Panama, and
                    asked if I would help Secretary Anderson, which I was happy to do. That was a
                    part time job, maybe fifty percent negotiating and fifty percent practicing law
                    in New York. As a matter of fact I did most of the negotiations, keeping in
                    touch with Secretary Anderson so he could participate to what ever degree he
                    wished.</p>
                <p>We ultimately reached an agreement with the Panamanian negotiators, of which
                    there were three, and both presidents, President Johnson and the then president
                    of Panama approved the agreement and were willing to sign, but this was in June
                    1968, perhaps, or 1967, I am a little uncertain, in any case the president of
                    Panama said “we have an election in September and it is now already June, even
                    though I approve the treaty I think it would be wiser politically here in Panama
                    if we waited until after the election. My party will undoubtedly win, I will not
                    be the president, but my successor, whom I have talked to, will approve the
                    treaty and he will have the support of the electorate, having just been
                    elected.” That was a good plan, but his party was defeated, the opposition took
                    over and two weeks later there was a military coup which remained in power until
                    relatively recently.So the agreement was never executed, although the impetus
                    which it started continued and in the late 60's or perhaps even later,
                    Ambassador Bunker and Ambassador Sol Linowitz took over the job of negotiating a
                    treaty with Panama, which they accomplished and which was signed and ratified by
                    our Senate and is now the law in the sense of international law and having
                    revoked the 1903 treaty which was certainly unpopular in Panama, and other
                    countries in South America who supported Panama, even though there was a strong
                    element in the United States that said we received it, it was a legitimate
                    treaty that was negotiated back in 1903 and we should not give it up. My
                    personal view, while understandable, was short sighted. If we had kept the
                    Canal, at the very least there would have been bad relations, not only in Panama
                    but in other Central American countries and in South America and at worst it
                    could have been the type of guerrilla, not real warfare, but attacks on ships or
                    parts of the Canal. As a historical note, those people who said we had a
                    legitimate agreement with Panama in 1903, that is correct, but also it could be
                    stated that in essence the United States encouraged Panama to have a revolution
                    against Colombia, which at that time owned Panama, or considered it part of it.
                    It became two countries, Colombia and Panama, and then we negotiated the 1903
                    agreement with the new government which we had just helped free itself from
                    Colombia. So you have all this type of background and one can argue both
                    sides.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>Actually the treaty accomplished by ambassadors Bunker and Linowitz is better
                    than our treaty considerably, more simple, and that can be ascribed to the fact
                    of the maturing of the views of some of congressmen and senators. When we began
                    negotiating we had to keep in very close touch with the Senate and the House
                    too, and to be sure that we only negotiated what we could get confirmed by the
                    Senate. Whether we were right or wrong, we felt that we had to have more
                    restrictive agreements than Ambassador Bunker and Ambassador Linowitz were able
                    to succeed in accomplishing. I think it is partially because they did not have
                    quite the difficult attitudes in the Senate that existed those five to ten years
                    earlier.</p>
                <p>After that negotiation, I came back of course to the law which I was continuing
                    to do part time in New York. At this time I might say that I loved working in
                    Washington. It was a fascinating life and I would urge it on any young man or
                    woman who has the opportunity, but at the same time I was always content to come
                    back to New York and my regular life job when my particular job in Washington
                    was over. I had no desire to hang on in Washington. One of the unfortunate
                    things about Congress, I have often thought, is that a Congressman comes from a
                    small town in the Middle West, such as my origin in Keokuk, Iowa, he becomes so
                    interested and fascinated in the international as well as the broad social life
                    of Washington that he hates to go back to Timbuktu. Therefore he tends when he
                    is defeated or leaves Congress he tends to join a law firm and many of them
                    become lobbyists. Of course, many of them do a legitimate job as lawyers, but
                    still I think it is too bad that more of them do not take back to their hometown
                    and their home state the knowledge and background they have received in
                    Washington. They could be very helpful in their own localities and their own
                    states rather than becoming another ex - congressman in Washington. That is a
                    personal view and obviously not supported by many in Congress.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>Back in New York I was busy with my law practice. It was just after, I think,
                    President Nixon was elected, I had a call from Elliot Richardson, who was then
                    the under secretary of state, at that time the under secretary had not been
                    redesignated the deputy secretary, but he was called the under secretary as
                    opposed to the two other deputy under secretaries. Mr. Richardson said that
                    President Nixon would be pleased if I would negotiate — he gave me two choices
                    actually, (I don't know if they were real choices actually) but he mention two
                    possibilities, one was to be ambassador to NATO and one would be to negotiate
                    with Peru on a recent expropriation they made of the International Petroleum
                    Company. The International Petroleum Company was the subsidiary of a Canadian
                    subsidiary of Standard Oil of New Jersey at that time. They also wished to have
                    somebody make representations about tuna, tuna fishing in the seas off South and
                    Central America. I said I would do that and spent quite a bit of time in Peru
                    negotiating with the generals and admirals who had seized control some time
                    before from the civilian government. Again it was an enjoyable service. I even
                    liked the generals and admirals, as individuals they were nice men. Peru is a
                    most attractive country with a most interesting, hospitable citizenry. At that
                    time it was a pleasant country to visit and to be in. All I really did was to
                    stave off a break in relations between Peru and the United States, because Peru
                    was not willing at that time to meet U.S. wishes and the U.S. was not willing to
                    forego those wishes. But, at the same time, they did not wish to cut off aid and
                    there was the law that required that aid was cut off if the country did certain
                    things that effected our relationship. So while there were negotiations going on
                    there was no need to break off aid, which would have, perhaps, lead to breaking
                    relationships between the two countries.</p>
                <p>That too, as a negotiation, was continued at a later date. Other people
                    successfully solved in that each country interpreted an agreement reached their
                    own terms. Peru interpreted it that it had not met the wishes of the United
                    States and the United States interpreted as having adequate satisfaction so both
                    countries kept their so - called pride, but did reach an agreement and our
                    relations were never broken off. Everyone knows that Peru has suffered greatly
                    since, as a matter of fact, it never recovered from the military coup that took
                    place. In some areas the military did all right, but they had one problem after
                    another, and today with the rebels [Shining Path] and one can only hope that
                    future holds something better for the very fine little country of Peru.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>After Peru I again came back to the law practice and in early 1973 President
                    Nixon moved Under Secretary Richardson to be Secretary of Health, Education and
                    Welfare and invited me to take the under secretaryship, which I was delighted to
                    do to go back to the interesting life of Washington. While I was in office they
                    changed to title from being the under secretary to deputy secretary, largely I
                    thought because the Defense Department had the deputy secretary and other
                    departments were beginning to have deputy secretaries. I was the only voice that
                    said we should retain keep the title the under secretary, it had been a
                    traditional title, but my boss, then Secretary William Rogers, decided that we
                    change the title to deputy under secretary so my title changed with no change in
                    duties whatsoever. I continued in State until the end of 1974, at that time
                    there was a vacancy in the embassy in France and President Nixon asked if I
                    wanted to go to France. He appointed Kenneth Rusk as deputy secretary of state
                    and I accepted to go to the embassy in France.</p>
                <p>I had known in moderation France, but never intimately. Paris itself is such a
                    beautiful city that it was a delight to be in. I found the French charming and
                    hospitable. Often I would have Americans come to me and say that “I find the
                    French so irritating” whether they were just passing in the street or what their
                    experience in a shop had been. I would say, “Yes that is true, they can be, were
                    and are, but you must remember that they can find Americans equally irritating
                    from their perspective so we both have to recognize that we can irritate the
                    other, so let's not let the irritation, at least from the American point of
                    view, overcome our good sense and recognition of the vital role that France
                    plays in Europe, and in much of the rest of the world, originally through its
                    former colonial empire and then through its successful continuance of its
                    friendly and sometimes paternalistic relationship with its former colonies.
                    Anyway France has done a better job in keeping its good relations with its
                    former colonies than perhaps the British have.” Although I always thought that
                    when they had colonies Britain ran them better than France, but that is one of
                    those uncertain things that one never knows too much about.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Perhaps my first experience in France goes back to my days in the Defense
                    Department. I traveled with President Eisenhower when we went to London, Bonn
                    and Paris. At that time the U - 2 had just been shot down over the Soviet Union,
                    Secretary Dulles had died and Secretary Herter was Secretary of State. We were
                    at a meeting of NATO in Turkey and I remember the incident well; we had just
                    left NATO and were flying to Athens and this message came to Secretary Herter
                    that the U - 2 had been shot down. It was partially a result of that that we
                    returned more quickly to the United States. There was a debate as to whether or
                    not we should avow the U - 2 or whether we should just keep silent on it, or say
                    nothing about it as if it were not basically our aircraft. However the ultimate
                    decision reached by President Eisenhower was that it be accepted as our
                    airplane. As a matter of fact he gave out all the pictures that had been taken
                    to show what it could take in Russia. The plane used to fly from Pakistan to, I
                    think, Norway and then back and forth. It had made many successful flights, it
                    could fly above what was thought to be the range of any then artillery or
                    missile, but on the day that Gary Powers was flying it from Pakistan to Norway,
                    whether the plane was low or the missile was higher than it was thought to be,
                    it was shot down, and the pilot, whose name was Gary Powers, was taken prisoner.
                    Later on he was exchanged for a spy [Colonel. Abel] whom we had incarcerated
                    over here.</p>
                <p>That U - 2 incident of course aggravated the relationship between Russia and the
                    United States; Premier Khrushchev had previously visited the United States and
                    there was beginning to be a softening of relationships, a least a little better
                    relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think he went to your home state.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IRWIN: Yes, he went to Iowa, California, several places across the country. A
                    meeting between France, England, Russia and the United States had been set for
                    Paris and that came just after the U - 2. President de Gaulle was then still
                    alive and in power. There was the assembly of the four heads of those states,
                    but it was clear that the meeting that could have been profitable under the
                    relationship pre - U2 could not have continued in the atmosphere because of the
                    attitude and indignation of the Soviet government. At that meeting I would say
                    that although President de Gaulle has never been particularly popular with
                    Americans, he generally was not popular with our military, at that time I
                    thought he was very helpful to President Eisenhower in easing the situation at
                    the meeting between Khrushchev and Eisenhower. There was no question that de
                    Gaulle, while trying to keep the meeting in even temper, was clearly in
                    Eisenhower's corner.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Another incident of de Gaulle I would mention that I did not know about, but only
                    heard about, but in that same line. Was in the Cuban missile crisis when
                    President Kennedy had taken over. Later on our aerial photography showed
                    missiles being moved into Cuba by the Soviet Union and it was at that point that
                    President Kennedy faced up to Primer Khrushchev that they be withdrawn.
                    President Kennedy sent emissaries to the European countries and show them
                    pictures of the missiles and explain the background so that we would have the
                    support of our NATO allies and they would understand what was going on. I have
                    always been told that when the emissary got to President de Gaulle, President de
                    Gaulle said, “You don't have to show me the pictures. Tell President Kennedy he
                    has my support”. So while I think that the French are always individualistic,
                    they are always zealous and jealous of their so - called French independence,
                    they are particularly keen to be sure their language remains pure and they can
                    be mischievous when their people with their language are involved, you may
                    remember when General de Gaulle visited Canada. When he left he said, “Viva
                    Quebec libre!” which did not please the Canadian government at all, although it
                    did please the French nationalists in Quebec.</p>
                <p>My having left the State Department which brings us to our present topic. I might
                    say that my only tie to the government since I left France was that I served on
                    a commission to UNESCO under President Reagan. That was an interesting short
                    term service.</p>
                <p>Now in France it is difficult, both because of faulty memory and I have kept no
                    records, I left them in the State Department and I failed to keep a diary. In my
                    next life, if I ever have the opportunity, I will keep a diary. In preparing for
                    this interview I asked two of my former colleagues in Paris, Dan Phillips, who
                    is now ambassador to the Congo, and Hank Cohen, who was political counselor and
                    is now assistant secretary for Near East and Africa, to remind me of principle
                    issues. So what I say is more a measure of their memories than it is of
                    mine.</p>
                <p>My ambassadorship came at a time when France was moving into a new internal
                    relationship as well as a relationship, perhaps, with its NATO allies and the
                    United States. The transitional period in French politics was from de Gaulle to
                    whomever was ultimately to follow, but the immediate transition was to President
                    Pompidou. President Pompidou took office immediate following President de
                    Gaulle's resignation and continued to the election of Giscard D'Estaing in early
                    1974. It was clear that President Pompidou did not have the charisma and the
                    wide appeal that General de Gaulle had, but he did have a sense of pragmatism,
                    which I felt was very valuable at that time. In fact at the time of his death I
                    felt that France lost at his early death, I think that if he had survived for a
                    couple of more years it would have been better for the transition from de Gaulle
                    to, as it turned out, President Giscard than as it was, his having died that
                    early. But all was not easy with the Pompidou regime. He himself was a much
                    easier man to deal with than General de Gaulle, partially because of his
                    pragmatism and partially because he had been a businessman a considerable part
                    of his life, he was a partner in one of the Rothschild operations. He was just a
                    solid, fine individual, at least in my mind.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>While he was in the Elys�e Palace his primary assistant for foreign affairs was
                    Michele Joubert and while M. Joubert was in the Elys�e I found him always
                    helpful. When I had problems and while we may have disagreed with a problem he
                    was helpful. Then President Pompidou appointed him foreign minister and he moved
                    to the Quai d'Orsay and from then on he was unhelpful. I have never quite
                    understood the change, almost in personality, that occurred from Joubert leaving
                    the Elys�e Palace and then going to the Quai. Perhaps it was the issue, perhaps
                    it was because he was in more true foreign policy charge of the issues. Other
                    people have queried whether it was a sense of competition with the then
                    Secretary Kissinger who had been in a comparable position with the Nixon in the
                    White House before he became Secretary of State, whatever it was he did make
                    quite a change. That does get on further than the issues to which I might
                    speak.</p>
                <p>During Pompidou's regime, his party, the UDR, the Union [?] de la R�publique, was
                    losing strength. The center and center right and just left of center were
                    gaining strength, and that was Valery Giscard D'Estaing's Federation National de
                    Republican Independant or RI as we would say, Republicans Independent, along
                    with other centrist parties, Servan Schreiber's Radical Party, called CD. They
                    were moving towards becoming the primary political force, if you joined them all
                    together in France. In the elections in early 1974 or you could say that the
                    early elections in 1973 you could say that while the UDR, the Gaullist party,
                    had the largest party in the Assembly, it no longer had an absolutist majority.
                    It had to work with Giscard D'Estaing's Republican Independents with the Radical
                    Party and with the CD in order to have an absolute majority. At the 1973
                    election in France in which the UDR Party one the largest number of seats but
                    not an absolute majority the Socialist Party under Fran�ois Mitterrand won a
                    number of seats, I don't remember how many, but it was enough to be recognized
                    as a small section of the parliament. Mitterrand almost immediately began to
                    develop a relationship with the Communist Party, trying to get them to work
                    together on socialist issues. This was displeasing to the United States and
                    Secretary Kissinger was concerned and asked that the embassy make a demarche to
                    M. Mitterrand to see if he would not break off from the Communists. The concern
                    was that the Communists might through the Socialists develop too much influence
                    in the overall two parties and therefor effect the relationship that France had
                    with its allies. We made such a demarche, which M. Mitterrand did not accept and
                    as ultimate political events showed, he was correct. You have to skip a few
                    years until the election in which the Socialist won and President Mitterrand
                    came to power. He brought the Communists into power with him but they steadily
                    lost power in the French electorate and they went down from something like
                    fifteen to twenty percent or even a little more to down to under ten percent,
                    maybe under five percent. So Mitterrand strategy of bringing them in and then
                    encompassing them and smothering them, you might say, within his own party was
                    successful both for his view and to a large degree for ours — I am getting a
                    little ahead of ourselves for that happened considerably after. The
                    consideration came much later than when he was a small party in the French
                    parliament in 1973.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>As mentioned earlier the de Gaulle government was almost fanatical in its desire
                    to be independent, particularly to be seen in Europe and by the Soviet Union as
                    not a dependent of the United States. It had a combined view of the United
                    States, or rather, a schizophrenic view almost, on one hand it had certain
                    resentments against the United States in theory, not in any particular issue,
                    but just the concept of we being too powerful in Europe, on the other hand it
                    recognized the importance of the military strength of the United States in back
                    of the NATO allies. Any one who listens to this tape will know that General de
                    Gaulle withdrew militarily from the NATO alliance, he drew his military forces
                    out from under the military command of the NATO headquarters, however France
                    remained a member of NATO, often that is misunderstood in the United States and
                    people thought that France just withdrew from NATO. They only withdrew from the
                    military arm of NATO. They would not have thought of moving away from the
                    political side of NATO for that would have lessened their political influence in
                    Europe. That is one of the key ambitions of France, to remain powerful
                    politically in Europe and in the Third World.</p>
                <p>In 1973 the United States had various objectives. One of them was to try to move
                    the Gaullist government, the UDR government, then under President Pompidou to a
                    more productive relationship with the United States, or at least a more open and
                    less confrontational dialogue. For this purpose the embassy met at all levels
                    with the French government. I would meet with President Pompidou, with Foreign
                    Minister Joubert, with Premier Jacques Chirac, and later on Premier Chablom
                    Delmonte and others while the staff of the embassy would be meeting with their
                    opposite numbers in the Quai d'Orsay, or perhaps with the Treasury or with the
                    Interior Ministry or whatever it may be. We tried to cover the whole gamut of
                    relationships so we could find out what the French were thinking and doing
                    throughout its government and report that to our government, and so that we
                    could tell the various arms of the French government our views and thoughts,
                    whether they were acceptable to the French or not. That is what we wanted to
                    achieve, a dialogue, even if we disagreed, rather than the sense we had a
                    difficult time talking to each other, which had existed under de Gaulle.</p>
                <p>As well as meeting with the government, of course, we met with the other
                    political parties, particularly with Giscard D'Estaing's party and the other
                    centrist parties and with the Socialists. We would hope that our relationships
                    that developed with the centrist parties would have been one of the reasons when
                    Giscard came to the presidency in May 1974 that the United States was able to
                    have good relationships with him to a much greater degree than it had with de
                    Gaulle and considerably better than with M. Pompidou and M. Joubert.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Carrying on the same tradition with the Socialists we met at all levels with the
                    Socialists. I had then M. Mitterrand, now President Mitterrand, to lunch at
                    least once and to my memory he came twice and some of the younger Socialists
                    were invited to visit the United States as part of the USIA international
                    visitors' program. This included certain men who became ministers later on under
                    the Mitterrand government. M. Mitterrand did not speak English but was
                    considered a French intellectual among the French intellectuals which was
                    somewhat unique for a French politician just as it would be for an American
                    politician. But you would have to say that M. Mitterrand had been an
                    opportunist. One time he worked closely with de Gaulle in the early days, then
                    he ran for political office under one of the centrist or conservative parties
                    and did not do well. Finally he shifted to the Socialist Party and it was there
                    that he came into his success, first in this modest way in 1973 and then later
                    on as all of us know, as president of France. This is jumping to his presidency.
                    During his first two years as president he put forward many of the Socialist
                    theories as part of his government program. It was only after two years of in
                    effect failure and watching the economy of France deteriorate substantially,
                    that he switched from socialism and became quite pragmatic and went into a
                    different phase which drew criticism over the past few years from some of his
                    theoretical socialists, but some acceptance from the business community. They
                    would now say that he is not as bad as they originally thought him to be or
                    expected him to be. That does not say that most of the businessmen you meet in
                    France would not say they would like to see the Socialists defeated in the next
                    election. But at almost the same breath they would fear that there is no one on
                    the horizon that could defeat them. Speaking today rather than as I should be
                    talking about my embassy, I believe the Socialists could be defeated, and rather
                    easily, but only if M. Giscard D'Estaing, M. Chirac and M. Barre, who are the
                    three principle centrist or rightist who will all independently run for
                    president, but none of them will succeed, if all of them were to get together,
                    and say “We have agreed not to run, but will support so - and - so” they could
                    pick out whomever they wished out of the center parties, then I think France
                    would really have a chance for a new look. A new president who would defeat the
                    Socialists, who would not be far right, but have the support of those three
                    gentlemen who had power in the past politically and still have power, but not
                    sufficient power. Again as many know M. Chirac has been an excellent mayor of
                    Paris, but will not, in my mind, succeed in becoming president of France.</p>

                <p>However, that may be wrong, but as we go back to the time of 1974 and de Gaulle
                    and Pompidou, energy was one of our issues, there was disagreement. As you may
                    remember, OPEC had recently been formed and the price of oil was rising because
                    of the policies of OPEC. Secretary Kissinger wanted the United States to lead a
                    bloc of the Western countries and take a tough attitude in the negotiations with
                    OPEC. Pompidou and Joubert preferred to have a French - led dialogue with OPEC
                    on behalf of the Western countries, including the United States. They argued
                    that they had a special relationship with Arabs in contrast with the United
                    States relationship with Israel which they felt would be would be
                    disadvantageous with the Arabs. The combination would qualify France for the
                    leadership. There was merit in the French position, but it also reflected their
                    deep - seated resistance to U.S. leadership over Europe. They recognized U.S.
                    leadership in military affairs and leadership in other parts of the world, but
                    they always strived to prevent a domination by the United States, at least what
                    they considered a domination, of Europe even through NATO.</p>
                <p>Foreign Minister Joubert took a harsh line against the United States also on the
                    issue also on the issue of the formation of the International Energy Agency. We
                    strongly favored its creation. Kissinger pushed it hard with the rest of Europe
                    and Joubert became more Gaullist than de Gaulle and was abusive both of the
                    United States and its allies over the issue. In fact, he opened one of the EEC
                    Council of Ministers meetings at that time by saying to his European colleagues,
                    Bonjour Monsieur l'Trait! As an aside on M. Joubert, even with his anti - U.S.
                    views at the time he was Minister of Foreign Affairs, his wife is an American
                    and his child was at that time attending the American School in Paris. In the
                    end France was isolated in opposing the IEA and as time went on Joubert faded
                    from prominence when Giscard won the presidency. Throughout that period the
                    embassy's mission was to present the U.S. views forcefully but diplomatically in
                    the sense that I mentioned earlier, seeking a dialogue rather than just a
                    confrontation.</p>
                <p>In defense there was also disagreements between the United States and France.
                    Some of them were the abstract differences arising from France's so - called
                    desire for independence, but also there were concrete issues, such as the
                    financial one of the replacement of aircraft by Belgium, Denmark, the
                    Netherlands and Norway. The issue was the U.S. F - 16 pitted against the Mirage
                    M - 53. There was great political pressure by France on its neighbors and the
                    U.S. too was trying to sell its airplane, although at that time and I think it
                    is still largely the policy of the United States as the government generally
                    kept out of economic issues of trying to persuade a country to buy a particular
                    American product. We would speak generally to the ambassadors of European
                    countries in Paris or other ambassadors would talk to the countries to which
                    they were assigned, we did not exert the same kind of political pressure on the
                    potential purchasers of an aircraft that France did, directly in support of its
                    industry. That of course is true of most other countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>The United States is almost isolated in its traditional distancing itself from
                    the business of the United States rather than looking at the examples of the
                    France, Japan, the Soviet Union and even Britain, all of whom support to a much
                    greater degree their economic outreach than the United States has. I hope in
                    more recent times, and in the future, the United States is moving towards more
                    support of its private sector because so much of the world today is
                    international economic competition. If the United States business has no support
                    from the United States government and the other countries have support it makes
                    it a much more difficult competitive environment for an individual American
                    business, particularly a small business in the United States. That, of course,
                    is personal opinion.</p>
                <p>Another less publicized issue was the problem that arose from the visit of U.S.
                    naval ships which might have nuclear weapons aboard to French ports. The United
                    States never will state whether or not a particular vessel has or has not
                    nuclear weapons, but it just in effect desires our ships to come ashore. The
                    French did not object to our coming into port, but there was a difference of
                    opinion as to the type of indemnity that would result if there were an accident,
                    particularly a nuclear accident, when a vessel of the United States was in a
                    French port. The French wanted to have any indemnity or fault decided by the
                    French courts. The United States held that it should be subject to bi - lateral
                    negotiations. It was not decided during my time.</p>
                <p>With respect to the broader issues of NATO and detente and the EEC, by detente I
                    really refer to the Soviet Union, at that time President Pompidou and Minister
                    Joubert questioned what they called our over commitment to detente with the
                    USSR. That had a certain irony to it because France over the years has looked to
                    itself as the principle link to the Soviet Union for Europe, and itself would
                    have liked to be the real representative for the Western group with the Soviet
                    Union, and even helping the U.S. with the Soviet Union. Along with that there
                    was disagreement on the Force de Frappe, the nuclear force of France which grew
                    at the same time that the nuclear force of England was growing. The United
                    States never objected to the nuclear force in England and France, and it fact
                    had helped at certain times, but it was not enthusiastic about it. The Soviet
                    Union was, of course, opposed to it. So there was always an element of question
                    in dealing with France about the Force de Frappe, any limited test ban treaty
                    with the Soviet Union, who wished to include the French and British forces and
                    the United States said, “We have no control over them.” The Soviet Union was
                    looking in effect for us to have the same type of control over the nuclear
                    forces of France and England as they had over the forces they put into Eastern
                    Europe. Of course, Eastern Europe had no nuclear forces of their own. So France
                    was of two minds, as I mentioned earlier. They wanted not to have the U.S. in
                    too great prominence and control in Europe, but they also worried that if the
                    U.S. was pushed too far from Europe, isolationist sentiment might take over in
                    the United States and it might weaken alliance because of the uncertainty of the
                    military power being available from the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>So all through this thing you have this dual view. At the same time that these
                    issues were occurring with France, and of course in different degrees on other
                    issues with other countries, Europe was going through what possibly might be
                    called a difficult phase. Revolutionary change was underway in Portugal with the
                    ultimate end of the Salazar regime, the Greek - Turkish dispute over Cyprus had
                    heated up, there was unrest in Spain and Italy which threatened the democratic
                    underpinnings. At one time there was real concern about the Communist strength
                    in Italy. Of course there was the civil war earlier in Spain and then there was
                    the domination of Franco, and in Italy there was the Communist potential. One
                    was concerned with the future of Spain. Although no one probably remembers it
                    today, there was often discussion in the press and among the commentators who
                    had to look for something to say in their columns, about the Finlandization of
                    areas of Western Europe or all of Western Europe. That disappeared in time, but
                    there was a period when that was of concern.</p>
                <p>As a result of all this France did begin to show a degree of greater flexibility
                    in its role towards NATO. The French attitude toward NATO loosened in the sense
                    that it began to cooperate in small, low visibility steps, such as in planning,
                    logistics, more information sharing, joint exercises of our forces even though
                    they maintained independent control of their forces, and that type of military
                    issue in which they could cooperate without appearing to reduce their political
                    independence or their separation of military force. Still it represented a giant
                    step away from de Gaulle's attitude which was perhaps best stated or symbolized
                    by his contentious statement that France nuclear arms defended France from
                    aggression coming from both the East and the West.</p>
                <p>Another side of closer French - U.S. cooperation on Europe resulted from a U.S. -
                    EEC agreement to share information and consult as the community developed common
                    foreign policies. This arrangement was originally opposed by France, they were
                    reluctant to reach an agreement but such an agreement was worked out by
                    Secretary Kissinger and Foreign Minister Joubert. The French honored the
                    agreement when it came the time for a Frenchman to be the head of the EEC
                    because it was under each presidency that the president would enter into the
                    discussions with the United States, normally of the embassy in the country which
                    held the presidency of the EEC.</p>
                <p>When Giscard took over there was more cooperation. As Pompidou had begun to move
                    away a degree from de Gaulle's firm position, Giscard moved considerably further
                    and was cooperative, and even worked well with the United States. During
                    Giscard's period he initiated a North - South dialogue. The United States was
                    not particularly enthusiastic about that because it felt that it would result on
                    a greater demand on U.S. resources through aid. But we agreed to it and went
                    along with Giscard with it . Similarly Giscard came up with the idea of an
                    economic summit with the Western countries — that started at the time I was in
                    Paris, but finished thereafter a couple of years later. Not much was done
                    through the embassy. It was largely done by Mr. George Shultz, who was sent as a
                    special, almost a secret, envoy by Dr. Kissinger to work with the countries of
                    Western Europe.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Economics and trade has always been an issue, or potential issue between France
                    and the United States. They support strongly their own agriculture and do not
                    wish to be undersold by any other country, certainly not by the United States
                    shipping large quantities of grain which we have often for sale at a lower
                    price. They were concerned about the floating of the dollar, which — I forget
                    the exact time it went off the gold standard — but it occurred while I was in
                    France. If the dollar seemed to be too high the French criticized the United
                    States for undermining French economic stability; it is was too low they were
                    apt to charge we were dumping cheap goods on the French market and competing
                    unfairly with their industry. That of course remains a perennial issue and still
                    is one of the facts involved in GATT today and will be involved even more so if
                    we succeed with a free trade agreement with Mexico, the United States and
                    Canada.</p>
                <p>The Middle East was always an area of contention. Secretary Kissinger at that
                    time was taking a step by step approach to the Middle East. The French preferred
                    an international conference which they felt that they could have more dominance
                    in politically because of their position, not only within Europe, but because of
                    their previous position and relationships with the Arab world. Because of that
                    Joubert gave great support to Arafat and the PLO [Palestine Liberation
                    Organization] supporting, as a modest example, Arafat's request to address the
                    United Nations. All of which was irritating to the United States and we, of
                    course, differed frankly with them. The degree which we succeeded to any
                    leadership in the United States, the difference in feeling can be recalled in a
                    comment that M. Joubert made when he spoke of the United States leadership in
                    the Middle East peace process as a humiliation for France. That seems from our
                    point of view a rather narrow, individual view, but anyway that is what his
                    statement was. The embassy's mission was damage limitation and using diplomacy
                    and dialogue rather than confrontation.</p>
                <p>In the negotiations to end the Vietnamese war France was very helpful. Most of
                    the negotiations took place in France, secretly by Secretary Kissinger himself
                    dealing with the Vietnamese representatives in France. The embassy had
                    practically nothing to do with that as it was directly out of Kissinger's office
                    when he was National Security Advisor and later, of course, when he was
                    Secretary of State. Again the duality of the French views came forth, some
                    circles in France were happy to see the United States humiliated in Vietnam,
                    others were concerned because they knew that it was essential for a strong
                    Europe to have strong outward looking America who would be willing to cooperate
                    with Europe and not retreat into isolationism, which Europe remembers as a
                    former strong feeling in the United States, certainly at the beginning of World
                    War II.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>I spoke earlier about President Giscard D'Estaing's approach being less
                    ideological, but even there he had certain inhibitions because Jacques Chirac
                    was a strong Gaullist and he was his prime minister. All of that limited to some
                    degree Giscard's ability to move away from the Gaullist doctrine although he and
                    his foreign minister, Savingard, became the architects of what could be termed a
                    more benign foreign policy towards the United States and towards the world and
                    accordingly our relations improved.</p>
                <p>The embassy in other contexts continued to work with France, criticized French
                    views but presented French views to the United States in a way we could
                    understand the French point of view and not just as a confrontational issue. We
                    tried to oppose voices in Washington that appeared to be confrontational and
                    looked at French views of the French government primarily with pretension and
                    ambition other than trying to get a working agreement together. We tried to
                    point out to both sides that we were in favor of a strong France, economically
                    and militarily, because it would complement the United States' power, not only
                    in NATO and Europe, but throughout the world. That was the approach that Giscard
                    and the U.S. administrations following the time I was in Paris really adopted
                    and worked quite well together with.</p>
                <p>There were other important, but less political issues, one of which, for example,
                    dealt with culture. France always was concerned and perhaps upset that after
                    World War II much of the modern painting world, the center of it, shifted to the
                    United States, away from the traditional situation where Paris was the center of
                    all the art world. Now whether that is going on today, there is some question,
                    whether in the 1990s it is shifting partly back to Europe, partly back to here.
                    There was one incident dealing with a painting that the National Gallery was
                    purchasing from a Frenchman. I had Frenchman who had been in what would have
                    been comparable to their supreme court call me as an independent position, he
                    was not calling as an official of France, but calling because he was concerned
                    about the National Gallery purchasing this very fine French painting. He asked
                    me if I could not persuade the National Gallery to take another painting rather
                    than this particular painting. Fortunately I could disavow any part of what the
                    National Gallery was doing, or any influence on it.</p>
                <p>But there are elements in France that carry their position not only in the
                    political, military and economic world, but also in the cultural and aspects of
                    business and the media. I think in essence the view in France really remains
                    much the same that it always has, the desire to perpetuate the French language
                    as a beautiful language used throughout the world wherever it has been used and
                    a desire to remain a strong influence in Europe and always looking askance at
                    the United States if we appear to be too dominant in our relationships with NATO
                    or the EEC. It will be interesting to watch the next decade of the 1990's to
                    watch what happens to our relationships in Europe as a result of the situation
                    in Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union.</p>

                        there are in the archives over two hours of brilliant analysis by an
                        American of extraordinary talent who believes in the foreign policy of the
                        United States and who has been a practitioner in a rich variety of vineyards
                        that our country has maintained throughout the world and I want to thank
                        you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IRWIN: I want to say what a pleasure it was to talk with you on this, to try
                    bring back to mind...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is Thursday, May 31, 1991 in Mr. Irwin's office and we
                        are in the process in closing an interview of his experiences regarding the
                        U.S. government in foreign affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>IRWIN: If I might repeat what I said at the beginning, it is always a pleasure to
                    work in Washington, at least it has been my pleasure. I have enjoyed the
                    privilege whenever I have had that opportunity to serve.</p>
                <p>Going back to making one more point with respect to the Defense Department.
                    Perhaps it can be inserted into my comments on Defense. I thought it was
                    interesting to remark that I served under three secretaries of defense. I
                    arrived under Secretary Charles Wilson who had been the head of General Motors.
                    He was succeeded by Mr. Neil McElroy, who had been CEO of Proctor &amp; Gamble.
                    The next secretary and the last one under whom I served was Secretary Thomas
                    Gates. All three were fine men. If one had to make a choice, I would have to
                    list Secretary Gates as the number one, partially because of his overall
                    background and knowledge, and also because he had served as Secretary of the
                    Navy, then as Deputy Secretary of Defense before he became Secretary of Defense.
                    He had had a long experience in Washington and in military and defense affairs.
                    He was a remarkable man.</p>
