                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ed, tell me when and where you were born and something
                        about your family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I was born in Marion, Indiana on the 5th of June 1936. I'm the eldest
                    of three children. Our mother and father were married when they were at DePauw
                    University, in Greencastle, Indiana.</p>
                <p>My father was born in Indianapolis, but grew up in Marion. His name was Hugh
                    Edward Wilkinson. My mother, Sarah Emily Smith, was born in Anderson, which is
                    twenty miles to the south of my birthplace. She moved to Marion after she and my
                    father got married at the height of the Depression in 1933. I didn't come along
                    until 1936.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a little about first the background of your
                        father, your family. How did they all get to Indiana and what were they
                        doing after they arrived there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I can actually talk about that at length because my paternal
                    grandfather's first cousin, a librarian, spent a great deal of time researching
                    the family history. She wrote a bit about what she found interesting, and I have
                    a copy of her study. According to her, the first person in our line in the U.S.
                    was a certain John Wilkinson, who, though probably British, apparently came to
                    the U.S. from Ireland in the late 1700s. In any event, he arrived in the New
                    World at Cape Cod, and then moved down into North Carolina where he established
                    a home.</p>
                <p>Towards the end of his life, the whole family emigrated westward, but he died at
                    about the time they were leaving. So three or four of his children and other
                    relatives moved to Ohio for a year or two, and then on to Indiana, near the town
                    of Peru, which is in north central Indiana. My grandfather was born in Peru in
                    1886. He, his elder brother and their two sisters lived there during their
                    childhood. The two boys stayed on in Indiana and the women moved to other parts
                    of the Middle West after they got married.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they farming, or merchants, or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: They were essentially business people. My grandfather worked for a
                    railroad at one point. Upon graduating from DePauw, my grandfather and his
                    brother went west. They spent quite a number of years in North Dakota where they
                    were in the lumber business.</p>
                <p>My grandfather participated in semi-pro baseball, while living in North Dakota.
                    According to family lore, which I think is true, he came back to the Middle West
                    on a baseball tour. There, in Morristown, Indiana, in what is now called the
                    Kopper Kettle Restauranthen, I think just a rooming houshe met my grandmother
                    who was visiting Morristown with her parents. My grandmother, my father's
                    mother, was born and raised in Columbus, Indiana. They later got married and
                    around 1912 moved to Marion where my grandfather got into the woodworking
                    business. He spent the rest of his life there. He and my father were both
                    associated with a small furniture company in Marion called the Spencer-Cardinal
                    Corporation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about on your mother's side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, I can tell you quite a bit about them, as well. The reason why
                    is that that side of the family tended to live into their 90's, and so I was
                    able to learn a great deal about their backgrounds from them, directly.</p>
                <p>My mother's father's family came from central Germany, specifically the area
                    around the town of Kirchhaim in the state of Hesse. My great, great grandparents
                    came to the U.S. in 1842. While I was assigned to Germany between 1995 and 1999,
                    I had the good fortune to visit the area where they were born and raised. In
                    fact, I was able to see my great-great grandmother's birth record in the church
                    where she was baptized in the town of Langenstein, a couple of miles from
                    Kirchhaim.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the name of the grandparents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: That part of the family was named Schmidt, although they later changed
                    it to Smith. My great-great grandmother's maiden name was Altainz. In the town
                    where she was born, Langenstein, I found a number of headstones in the local
                    cemetery with that last name, but from what I can gather they were not close
                    relatives.</p>
                <p>Anyway, they came in 1842 by boat to New York. My great-great grandfather,
                    Heinrich Schmidt, led a team of oxen, pulling a boat down the Erie Canal, and
                    they ended up in Butler, Pennsylvania, north of Pittsburgh. Heinrich became a
                    glass blower as did his son, my great grandfather, Conrad.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ?Pittsburgh Glass?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Perhaps a precursor of that company. The reason glass was manufactured
                    there in those days was the abundant natural gas in the ground in that part of
                    Western Pennsylvania. This resource made glass blowing relatively cheap and
                    convenient. But when the natural gas ran out, as it did while my great
                    grandfather Conrad was working there, they then immigrated to Indiana where
                    natural gas was still plentiful. In fact, they originally went to a place called
                    Gas City, Indiana, which was named for exactly that reason.</p>
                <p>My grandfather Walter, Conrad's son, told me the following story: He was a glass
                    blower, too, in those days (during the first few years of the last century) and
                    had found worperhaps a two or three week stint in a town a few miles north of
                    where he was then living, Anderson, Indiana. After the job was over and he was
                    on his way back to Anderson, he and a friend stopped at Gas City where they went
                    to a local glass company to look for possible future work. There on the company
                    premises they saw machines that essentially were doing the work of glass
                    blowers. My grandfather told me he took one look at the machines and knew his
                    days as a glass blower were numbered. He moved into other areas or employment
                    and ultimate got into management. He retired around 1960 after some years as
                    general manager of the Philadelphia Quartz Company in Jeffersonville, Indiana.
                    They moved back to Anderson where he and my grandmother lived into their 90s.
                    (Actually, my grandmother died just two months short of her hundredth
                    birthday.)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They (your grandparents) were also a presence in your
                        life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Oh, absolutely. My father's father, Hugh Boyd Wilkinson, died in 1946,
                    when I was ten, but his wife, my father's mother Anna Hughes Wilkinson, also
                    lived into her 90s, so I knew all three of my grandparents even after I became
                    an adult. I was very fortunate in this regard.</p>
                <p>There are a couple of things about my mother's family that are, I think, of
                    interest. My mother's grandfather, my great grandfather, Conrad, was a soldier
                    on the Northern side in the Civil War. He wrote a little book about his
                    experiences in the Civil War, and included in his account was a story about his
                    coming down by train with his unit from Pennsylvania to the Washington, DC area.
                    The troop train stopped in Baltimore, perhaps for the night. They were told that
                    some Southern sympathizers, known as “Copperheads,” would try to cause trouble
                    in Baltimore as the troops marched through the streets of Baltimore on their way
                    back to the train station. Although the Northern troops had loaded guns and
                    bayonets, they were told not to fire at the Copperheads if nothing more serious
                    than water or ashes were thrown at them.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>While they were being badgered by the Copperheads (mostly Baltimore city
                    firemen), four of the Pennsylvania men (formerly Pennsylvania Railroad workers)
                    went to the train station, found the oil house and set the station on fire.
                    While the Copperheads went to fight the fire, the troops boarded the train and
                    pulled out of town without a shot being fired. They moved down to Washington and
                    spent the night camped in Arlington, Virginia, just across the Potomac River
                    from the capitol.</p>
                <p>The next morning, according to my great grandfather, President Lincoln came to
                    the camp and asked the Pennsylvania troops to go under a flag of truce to the
                    Bull Run battlefield to bury the some three thousand bodies that had lain in the
                    sun for six days since the end of the battle. They had three days to do it, and
                    do it they did.</p>
                <p>My great-grandfather later fought at Gettysburg, and his name is on the big
                    Pennsylvania memorial there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you grow up in Marion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I grew up in Marion and lived there until I went off to college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's talk about Marion, as a kid. I take it you went
                        to public schools?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I went to public school, right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I didn't ask about religion, what about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I was baptized a Presbyterian. Most of my mother's family were Quaker
                    in the early days, but they later left the Quaker church. Here is a story I only
                    recently heard from my aunt, as a matter of fact. It refers to her mother's
                    parents. Apparently, her grandfather, her mother's father, was a Quaker, and he
                    was a physician. As a physician, he took it upon himself to treat unwed mothers,
                    a practice that I understand the Quakers were against. So as a matter of
                    personal decision, he left the Quaker church because he felt that every person
                    had the right to medical treatment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting because you would've thought that Quakers
                        would've been tolerant; they were tolerant of so many other things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, I'm repeating what I was told. I really don't know. I haven't
                    checked into that. It's a good point.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have brothers or sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, I have a brother and sister. My sister, Alice Jean, is six years
                    younger than I am. She lives in Wichita, Kansas. Our brother, Don, who lives in
                    Fort Wayne, Indiana, is five years younger than Alice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With a six-year difference, were you at all close?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, in spite of our age differences we were, I think, fairly
                    close.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about going to school there? What was your elementary
                        school experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I would say that my entire public school experience was typical of a
                    small town in the Middle West. I was able to walk to my schools from our house
                    in ten or fifteen minutes. I was not a great student. I just went to school just
                    like everybody else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any favorite teachers? We're talking about
                        the elementary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Oh sure. My favorite teachers were all disciplinarians. The more the
                    teacher was a disciplinarian, the better I liked her. I didn't think so at the
                    time, of course, but in thinking back, I realize that was the case. Miss
                    Ballard, my fourth grade teacher and Mrs. Wearly, my sixth grade teacher, were
                    two ladies who were tough. They didn't put up with any kind of foolishness,
                    including not doing homework on time. When I think back about my time in grade
                    school, I can recall intimately experiences in these two classes, particularly,
                    but also in the classes of several other teachers whose names I've long since
                    forgotten. I think remembering Miss Ballard and Mrs. Wearly has to do with my
                    liking them very much, and respecting them as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of intellectual interests, I mean that's maybe a
                        little high and mighty to say for a kid, but I mean, what, reading or
                        conversation or? we're still talking about the elementary level?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, I was known among at least some of my classmates as the
                    “reader.” They thought I was a little nutty because I would sit down and read
                    books. Now I certainly didn't read past my level, but I read more than most of
                    my contemporaries. I remember not so much what I read or what I learned, but
                    rather simply that people would comment about the fact that I was reading.
                    Another thing that I remember from those years was an intense interest in travel
                    and in learning about the world. Which probably is why I'm sitting here this
                    very moment. I don't know why, but I was absolutely fascinated with thinking
                    about other countries; of visiting and knowing about them.</p>
                <p>One of the things that I can recall in Miss Ballard's class was a book containing
                    six chapters that was the basis for one of our classes. Each of these six
                    chapters was about a different part of the world and about somebody who was a
                    typical person of that place.</p>
                <p>The one that I remember most was about an African boprobably about my age
                    thefrom, at that time, the Belgian Congo. The story was about his life, how he
                    lived, how his parents lived, how they made their living and so on. I have a
                    picture of that book in mind right now.</p>
                <p>Another thing I remember about other countries was from Mrs. Wearly's sixth grade
                    class, which for me would have been about 1948. We were asked to participate in
                    a paper drive. We collected used paper that was then to be sold. The income
                    would be used to purchase books for students in the Philippines, because many of
                    their school supplies had been destroyed during the war. Many years later, I
                    married a Filipino, and she and I like to speculate that she, at some point,
                    might have studied out of one of these donated books.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about at home? Both your parents were college grads,
                        which for our generation is not all that typical.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, that's true. And my father's parents were college graduates,
                    too, which was really unusual.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, a great majority of people about your age had parents
                        who were not college graduates. It didn't mean that they weren't well
                        educated because they often read a lot more than I think many college
                        graduates do today. Sort of the Harry Truman type thing. How about at home?
                        What was the environment at home?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, I wouldn't say for a minute that my parents were intellectual
                    giants, but they were educated and we did spend a good deal of time in
                    discussions about politics and history or about why this or the other thing was
                    happening. I can recall talking with my sister and brother more than once about
                    how fortunate we were to have had the kind of upbringing we had. Our parents
                    were educated people and the people they tended to be with were also educated.
                    They had people over to the house who had an interest in other parts of life
                    beyond just simply making a living or the conditions in Indiana. This was a very
                    fortunate thing for us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your father doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Dad worked in a white-collar job in a furniture-making factorthe
                    Spencer-Cardinal Corporatiothe company that my grandfather had been involved
                    with since the early part of the 20th century. They made tables and chairs, for
                    example, and they fashioned among the first wooden TV cabinets ever made. They
                    made virtually anything out of wood. My father worked in the office and was, at
                    least in later years, in charge of transportation. He died fairly early in life,
                    at the age of 48.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: High school; you'd been going to high school about '48 or
                        so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I graduated from Marion High School in 1954.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, '54, so you started in '50. What happened after your
                        father died? Was your mother working or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: My dad died in 1959, some years after I graduated from high
                    school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about high school. In Marion, was there much of
                        a mixture of black, white, ethnic groups?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Marion High School was pretty well represented with various ethnic
                    groups. One fellow, Otis Archey, a retired FBI agent, was a year behind me in
                    school, but later married one of my classmates. He was fairly recently elected
                    sheriff of Grant County where Marion is located. He thus became the first black
                    sheriff in the state, which, while awfully long in coming, still represents some
                    progress since the days when Indiana was an early home of the Ku Klux Klan.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you got to junior high and high school it was
                        time to sort of find your interests either in clubs or in studies or
                        something. What sort of turned you on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Two things. One is singing; I always was in the choir or in choral
                    groups or whatever. I'm an adequate singer. I can carry a tune, more or less.
                    I'm certainly not all that good, but I enjoyed singing. I participated in
                    anything along those lines I could get into. The other thing was dramatics. I
                    didn't act; I was on the stage crew and I thoroughly enjoyed that. Those are the
                    two things that occupied my leisure time. I tried to get into sports, but I was,
                    in a word, terrible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I imagine, particularly in the Midwest, sports are taken
                        pretty seriously, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Basketball particularly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Indiana. You don't mess around with that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, I can recall winters shoveling the snow off of places so we
                    could play basketball. We played the game wearing gloves and boots and other
                    heavy clothes when it was really cold, but that was standard business for kids
                    where I grew up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about, again, moving during this time, what about sort
                        of reading? Were you getting much of a feel for the world outside of maybe
                        some schoolbooks or something like that? I mean, what was going on, because
                        we're talking about the Cold War was in full swing during that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: My parents were committed Republicans, as were an awful lot of people
                    in Indiana in those days. I can recall tagging along with them in 1952 when they
                    went to a meeting that resulted in starting a small committee to push General
                    Eisenhower to be elected president.</p>
                <p>We discussed the Cold War rather at length around the dinner table. We talked a
                    lot about Senator McCarthy and what was going on with him, what he was saying,
                    why he was saying it, and so on.</p>
                <p>The other part of the answer to your question that I might mention is that my
                    parents subscribed to National Geographic magazine. I would take that upstairs
                    and devour it, even to the extent of clipping coupons in the back and sending
                    them off for free information about tourist destinations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of courses did you take in high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, probably my favorite teacher in high school was Miss Julie
                    Ballinger. The reason I say “Julie” is that there were two Ballinger sisters at
                    Marion High. The one I'm talking about was a math teacher. She taught
                    trigonometry and algebra. Her sister was an English teacher. Every morning, it
                    would seem, Miss Ballinger gave us a little lecture before starting class about
                    the merits of going to Purdue to become an engineer. Some 19 of us from our high
                    school graduating class trotted off to Purdue in the fall of 1954 to try to be
                    engineers. I think three from the group finally graduated in engineering.</p>
                <p>I was interested in that area of study largely, I think, because of Ms.
                    Ballinger's morning lectures, but I don't think I was very good in that field. I
                    spent three years in engineering at Purdue. I think that it was very good for
                    meven though I was studying things I really wasn't all that interested in. One
                    of the things about the study of engineering is trying to solve problems in a
                    way that makes sense, not mechanically, but in a way that is logical. Since my
                    days at Purdue, I've gotten very, very far away from all that, but I still find
                    myself periodically referring back to some of those thoughts of how to solve
                    problems. So I think that probably, in retrospect, the study of engineering was
                    very good in my case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had this teacher and everyone pointing towards Purdue.
                        Well there's the University of Indiana. How does Purdue fit with the
                        universities in the state?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Both are land grant schools about the same size, and of course they
                    were, and are, great rivals in football and basketball. Purdue focuses on
                    engineering. It also has a school of forestry and a school of applied science,
                    whereas Indiana University is more geared toward the history, English,
                    education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It has quite a language institute?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Language, absolutely. A lot of our Foreign Service colleagues studied
                    Russian there, for example. Indiana University is famous for the study of the
                    Russian language, among others. So these are the sorts of things on which these
                    schools focus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it was sort of a given that you would go to
                        university.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I don't recall there even being a discussion on that score. I don't
                    recall thinking about it either. I mean, the only issue was that my parents were
                    a little disappointed that I didn't choose DePauw where they, and my father's
                    father, had gone. I'm not sure why I didn't go to DePauw; I think it was Miss
                    Ballinger's morning lectures.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Purdue, as sort of the campus life
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, I liked it. Lafayette, Indiana, where Purdue is located is 70
                    miles away from where I grew up, so the life there was not all that different.
                    Soon after my arrival there, I joined a fraternity, the same fraternity my
                    father and his father belonged to. That also was a bit of a given, I guess. I
                    moved into the fraternity house as a freshman, something that the university
                    stopped allowing, actually, the next year.</p>
                <p>Living in a fraternity house made life quite different than the experience of
                    your average freshman. I can't tell you the number of people who were at Purdue
                    in the fall of 1954 (the figure 20,000 comes to mind), but it was a huge
                    operation for its time. As a consequence, I think that if you lived in a
                    dormitory during your first few weeks or months there you would tend to feel
                    quite lost. I didn't have that experience because I lived a men's fraternity
                    house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With engineering, were you getting strictly engineering or
                        did you taste other areas of study?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: You had to take some liberal arts courses, of course, particularly
                    during your first two years. I did not have to study a language or languages,
                    unfortunately, which I later regretted. But even as a freshman or sophomore
                    engineer, you basically focused on math and sciences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What turned you off on engineering?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I wasn't very good at it and I didn't like it. I found it far more
                    convenient to go down to someplace and have a few beers rather than study.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is there on engineering? Looking back on it was there
                        an aptitude, do you think? I mean for some people, that's what gets them. Or
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I think you're right it is aptitude. I think I recognized early on
                    that while this was something I could probably have gotten through, I didn't
                    want to do it. After my third year, I was back in summer school studying
                    thermodynamics. If I remember correctly, it was a six-hour course, so that was
                    all I was doing that summer. I remember waking up one morning at some ridiculous
                    hour, like four A.M., and experiencing a sort of epiphany. It came to me in
                    stark terms: “Ed, you are never going to be an engineer.” I might get a degree,
                    but being an engineer is a state of mind, not a question of a degree. I just
                    basically turned myself around at four o'clock that morning.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is your third year, so that would've been what, 1957?
                        Every male more or less faced the draft at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Right. Although I went to class that day, immediately afterwards I
                    hitchhiked back to Marion. I went straight to the Post Office where the draft
                    board was located. To my amazement, the lady in charge knew my grandmother, my
                    father's mother. They apparently played canasta together. Anyway, I think she
                    wanted to take extra good care of me.</p>
                <p>I told her I wanted to go into the Army for two years, so I could have a chance
                    to be sent overseas. However, the six-month military program had just started,
                    and she tried to talk me into doing that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The six month program being what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: You could go on active duty in the Army or, I think, the Air Force,
                    for a period of only six months, but then you had a much longer obligation as a
                    reservist. Her idea was that enlisting in one of the six-month programs would
                    make more sense in my case, because afterwards I could go back to college. But I
                    would have none of it. I wanted to be sent overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you went into what, the Army?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, after volunteering, I was just drafted into the Army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this would be '57-'59?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Correct. Because a friend of mine was getting married and I had been
                    asked to be in the wedding, I asked to put off being drafted for two months. So,
                    I went into the Army in September of 1957.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did they place you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Here was one of the turning points of my life. I reported at the Post
                    Office on the appointed day in September, and they sent me off to Indianapolis
                    for my physical, and thethat same daoff to Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri, for
                    basic training.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>After arrival at Ft. Leonard Wood, I spent about six weeks doing virtually
                    nothing because they had all these newly-arrived six-monthers who were just
                    getting started. The Army brass was trying to get them into training as quickly
                    as possible. They held off those of us who were not in the six-month program
                    from starting basic training because they just didn't have time to deal with
                    us.</p>
                <p>I can remember beginning basic training during October of 1957, the same month
                    that the Sputnik went up. We were all standing there watching it (you could see
                    it up in the air at night) thinking, “There is going to be war.” Well, of course
                    it didn't happen that way at all, but that was something that I remember from
                    early on. I spent eight weeks in basic training, then I was assigned to
                    clerk-typist school right there at Ft. Leonard Wood. Because Christmas was
                    coming, I spent four weeks in clerk-typist school, followed by two weeks off
                    during the Christmas holiday. Then we all came back for the final four weeks
                    starting in early January 1958.</p>
                <p>The rest of the story is what I was getting at a few seconds ago, and it is one
                    of the reasons why I am sitting right here talking to you. It turns out that, of
                    the Fort Leonard Wood clerk-typist school graduatefor as far back as anyone
                    could remembeall had stayed right there at Fort Leonard Wood to be clerks and
                    typists. Our class was the first to be sent to other military posts. Of the
                    people in my class who graduated (if that's the right word) as clerk-typists,
                    the first three in alphabetical order were sent to an Army post in Alaska. And
                    the rest of us went to Europe. If the last three in alphabetical order had been
                    sent to Alaska, that would have been my fate.</p>
                <p>We were sent first to Fort Dix, New Jersey. There they had a computer about the
                    size of this building, which was chugging along and pumping out the names of the
                    military people whose names had been entered, giving the all-important bit of
                    information: where they were to be assigned.</p>
                <p>Can you believe this? I ended up being assigned to Headquarters, Seine Area
                    Command, Paris, France!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, somebody had to do that. Front line of military
                        duty, huh?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I was willing to sacrifice. But it gets better. Upon arrival in Paris,
                    I was sent to an Army post called Camp des Loges located about 20 miles outside
                    of Paris. Although I was assigned to work in an office in downtown Paris, not
                    far from the Port Dauphine Metro stop, I was given a bunk out at the base. We
                    were bussed in early in the morning and bussed back to the base in the evening.
                    But one day, after about five or six weeks, my boss, Warrant Officer J.D. Stapp
                    (whom I remember well; a very nice gentleman) came to me and to another fellow
                    and said, “I have terrible news, men.”</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>But, you could tell by the twinkle in his eye that the news was not terrible at
                    all. He continued, “They've just told me that there's just not enough space out
                    at the base. You two are going to have to move downtown.”</p>
                <p>So I spent a little over a year living in a nice hotel in downtown Paris, just a
                    block from the Arc de Triomphe. This hotel, called the Hotel Royal Magda in the
                    rue Troyon, is still there. I visited it a couple of years ago. So during my
                    time living “off post,” I went to work by Metro, just like I'm doing today.</p>
                <p>Now, this was during part of the time of the Algerian revolution. The French
                    soldiers had uniforms very much like ours, so we were told to wear civilian
                    clothes to try to avoid being attacked on the street, which, unfortunately,
                    happened to the French from time to time. So not only was I living and working
                    in downtown Pariwhich was and is one of the most fabulous cities of the worlI
                    was wearing civilian clothes to work! And I was a 21-year-old private in the
                    Army. I remember that my Army income, including what I was getting to pay the
                    hotel, was about $305 a month. I lived very nicely during the year 1958.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, boy, yes. Were you able to partake of Parisian
                        life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, yes, and the reason I'm quick to answer that so positively is
                    that in those days your dollar was rather strong. We could do most everything.
                    We went to the Louvre, we went to other museums, we ate well at good
                    restaurants. I even met some local girls and had dates.</p>
                <p>I got to know a fellow from the Bronx, who was of Italian origin, and who picked
                    up French very quickly. I worked at learning the language, and after a time was
                    more or less able to communicate in very basic French. I wasn't and still am not
                    very good at it, but with him and many others we went out and enjoyed life;
                    including one evening dining at Maxim's Restaurant, which of course cost more
                    money than I could afford. But we did it once and I'm glad to have done that.
                    There was a restaurant in the Ile St. Louis that we favored that specialized in
                    cuisine from the Alsace region of France. To repeat, we lived very nicely. We
                    were given funding to live on the economy and live we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: February of '58 to August of '59.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't remember, was this when DeGaulle came to
                        power?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: I believe General DeGaulle returned to power in France a few weeks
                    after I left. However, I can recall participating in a pro-DeGaulle parade. I
                    was wetting my whistle at a bar not far from the Champs Elysees, near the Place
                    de la Rond Pointe. Down the Champs-Elys�es from the direction of the Concorde
                    came a rather noisy parade, and a number of us went out to see what was going
                    on. They were carrying pro-DeGaulle signs and were chanting and so on, so we
                    joined in and went with them down to the Arc of Triumph. We stayed there for the
                    entire demonstration. There were a lot of speeches and cheering, most of which I
                    didn't understand. But because I participated in that parade, I feel I can take
                    some responsibility for Mr. DeGaulle, President DeGaulle, coming back to
                    power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On your clerk-typist job, was it just pretty straight
                        clerk typist?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, it was pretty straightforward. I was put in charge of doing the
                    battalion daily orders. Actually, it wasn't a “battalion.” Our outfit was called
                    a “detachment,” but it was more or less battalion size. So, every day I put
                    these orders together, a series of official pronouncements on mostly mundane
                    things such as transfers, who was to do what, etc. It was something I was able
                    to do without a great deal of supervision, which was wonderful. I mean, I had to
                    report to people, I had things I had to do, but basically it was just a lot of
                    paperwork that I had to put into official orders. It was fairly simple.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the first place, did you come into any contact with our
                        embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: One of those summers, and I think it was '59, I went to the Fourth of
                    July celebration at the embassy, which in those days was open to virtually
                    anybody. You didn't have to work at the embassy or be invited in order to go.
                    Any American could attend. I went to the ambassador's front lawn near the
                    Chancery and went inside. There was minimal security concerns in evidence. I did
                    tell them I was with the Department of Defense, which was, of course,
                    technically true. That was the only brush with the embassy I had during my 18
                    months in Paris.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was going through Ed Wilkinson's mind as far as what
                        you would do after you got out in '59?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: I spent a lot of time trying to figure out some way to get overseas
                    again. This was uppermost in my mind. I would've taken any job, anything,
                    anything whatsoever. Any regrets? As Frank Sinatra sang, regrets, I've had a
                    few. But the main one, I suppose, is this: I told my father and mother that I
                    would like to stay in Paris to study for a while after getting out of the Army.
                    (Unfortunately, I didn't qualify for the GI Bill; I'd come into the Army just a
                    little too late.) I had met a couple of people who had stayed on and studied at
                    the Sorbonne or other places, and I wanted to do that. But my father said,
                    “Don't you think you would just play?” Of course I knew he was absolutely right,
                    so I didn't pursue it. I have an idea that if I had pursued it, they would've
                    been supportive. I now wish I had done that.</p>
                <p>Anyway, after I got out of the Army I went back to Purdue, and the idea was
                    basically to find the quickest way to a degree. I got a degree fifteen months
                    later in something called industrial economics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're not an industrial economist?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: No, I never did anything remotely along those lines. Once again, there
                    are some things I learned while studying industrial economics that I drew upon
                    as a consular officer, the cone in which I worked for much of my career. It's a
                    little hard to provide examples, but I feel like the education was not wasted
                    totally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're bringing up something that will come back again.
                        We're both basically professional consular officers and I've often noted
                        that as a consular officer within the Foreign Service, you have so much on
                        your plate in the morning and it has to be gone by the end of the day. How
                        do you do it? How do you do things and what do you do as opposed to what are
                        you thinking about and writing long think pieces for many of our
                        colleagues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, a consular officer is somebody who deals with two things. One,
                    of course, is visas, and this is a matter of law, at least in large part. On the
                    other hand, consular officers deal with something that is not totally a matter
                    of law, American Citizen Services. This includes everything from Social Security
                    entitlement and military pension payments to arrests, to deaths, to births
                    and... a seemingly endless list. If the American citizen who needs consular
                    services abroad were in the United States, he or she would be able to deal
                    directly with the agency involved. But, at an embassy or consulate, they have to
                    deal with the American Citizen Services office.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>So you do these two rather diverse jobs while working as a consular officer. At
                    first, of course, you focus precisely on the job to which you are assigned. You
                    may be focused on one rather narrow job as a visa officer, doing immigrant or
                    non-immigrant visas. Or you might be in American Services where you may have to
                    deal with the people who've just been arrested or perhaps the death of an
                    American citizen. Then later on, as you rise in rank, you manage dealing with
                    both these issues.</p>
                <p>We consular officers do these jobs all day, every day, in many cases. In recent
                    years, though, there are so many Americans traveling and living abroad and so
                    many more people applying for visas that you have many more officers,
                    particularly those at the beginning of his or her career, certainly, focusing on
                    one very small piece of the large issue of consular work. In my own particular
                    case, during the early part of my career I was assigned to rather small offices,
                    so I dealt with the entire gamut all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you graduated, when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I graduated from Purdue in January of 1961 with a degree in industrial
                    economics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a Republican, did you get caught up on the campus? Were
                        they at all interested in the election of 1960, which seemed to be, it
                        wasn't a classy election, but it was one that seemed to engage people that
                        are particularly young people intellectually?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I mentioned my parents were Republicans, but I didn't say I was. No, I
                    did not get involved in that at all. However, I did have the pleasure of seeing
                    the future President Kennedy give a campaign speech, but my having seen him was
                    sheer happenstancgood luck. It was not because I was desperate to get out there
                    to listen to what he had to say. No, I can't say that I was involved in any way,
                    shape, or form in politics in 1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time '61 was rolling around, did you have any idea
                        what you wanted to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: No, except for my underlying desire to return abroad in some form or
                    other. I did get a job upon graduation. My uncle had worked in management for
                    the Owens Illinois Glass Company, although by then he had moved on to another
                    company. But they were recruiting, so I applied for a job with them. I was
                    offered an opportunity, so I moved over to Toledo, Ohio, in maybe February or
                    March of '61 to start work with Owens-Illinois.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Toledo was the location of the main O-I headquarters. I went there to work there
                    in the main offices, in what they call “inside sales.” I spent about six months
                    in that job. The focus of inside sales is to get the product out to the
                    wholesalers as quickly as possible. For example, if a particular sale had been
                    in 'X' place, and the purchaser says, “I need 5,000 of these,” or “20,000 of
                    those,” it was our inside sales responsibility to ensure that the product got to
                    the right place on time. As an inside sales person, I might have to go out and
                    deal with a production foremen and say, “When are you going to put this
                    particular product back on the line? They need 20,000 of them next Thursday in
                    Tulsa.” Or some such. One of the interesting parts of working in a glass
                    factory, as far as I was personally concerned, was that what they were doing
                    there largely by machine was closely related to glass blowing. A number of the
                    O-I people were interested to find that I had a grandfather who had been a
                    professional glass blower. And I was very proud of that, as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well how come you did this for only about six months?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I worked in Toledo for only about six months. The idea was that I
                    would work in inside sales as training for becoming a salesman. After this
                    training period, I was transferred to New York City and made a part of the O-I
                    sales force working out of Rockefeller Plaza. After a bit of time reading in
                    there, I was asked to go down to New Jersey to do something special for the
                    office.</p>
                <p>I didn't have a company car yet, so I went to Port Authority and took a bus down
                    to Southern New Jersey. On the bus, I fell asleep and woke up well past my stop.
                    While sleeping I had, in a way, been stewing about the fact that my job seemed
                    not to have any possibility of overseas assignments. So, rather than backtrack
                    to the place where I was supposed to have gotten off the bus, I went back to
                    straight back to New York City, went to the office, found the boss and just
                    quit. I can't say it was the result of a huge amount of thought on my part. I
                    just knew that selling glass was simply not what I wanted to do.</p>
                <p>So I went back to Indiana. I was about twenty-five years old at this point, but
                    my mother, bless her heart, didn't say a thing to me about coming home with
                    virtually no warning and with no income. I had saved a little, so after a couple
                    of weeks, I went with a friend down to New Orleans and Florida. During this
                    trip, I had a lot of time to think about this idea that I couldn't seem to
                    shake: returning abroad. The idea of going as a student or traveling and doing
                    it on the cheap somehow didn't appeal to me. I guess I was focusing on figuring
                    out a way to do it as a job.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Let me explain what happened next, but to do that I have to backtrack a little.
                    When I was in the eighth or ninth grade, I had another teacher, Mr. Earl
                    Whitecotton, whom I liked and respected very much. For an assignment, he asked
                    us to be a report about what we wanted to do when we grew up. Well, I, in my
                    usual student fashion, didn't prepare anything until the night before. That
                    evening, I found an article in Reader's Digest magazine about being a diplomatic
                    courier, a professional Foreign Service courier. I basically plagiarized the
                    whole article and turned it in to Mr. Whitecotton, who probably gave me a C at
                    best.</p>
                <p>Anyway, during that trip to Florida I remembered the article, and when we
                    returned, I went to the library and found it. The first paragraph said that, to
                    be a courier, one needed to be a single male, a college graduate, over
                    twenty-five, have your military out of the way, and be able to type a certain
                    number of words per minute. I said, “Heck, that's me.” So I wrote a letter to
                    the State Department to see what needed to be done to apply. This would have
                    been in November of 1961.</p>
                <p>Some weeks went by and I received no answer. In early January of 1962, I flew out
                    to Washington. A friend I had met in the Army lived here in Washington, and he
                    was kind enough to let me sleep on his couch for a couple of weeks.</p>
                <p>Immediately after I arrived in Washington, I went to the State Department. There
                    was a personnel office for walk-ins just to the left of the D Street entrance,
                    where, until recently, there was a post office. Because security was not much of
                    an issue in those days, you could just walk in there and say, “Hello, I'd like
                    to get a job with the State Department.”</p>
                <p>I did just that. I told the personnel officer with whom I spoke that I wanted to
                    be a courier. She responded that because there are so many people waiting in
                    line, I'd have to wait a long time to have an opportunity to be a courier. She
                    did, however, offer me a job in the passport office. There were openings at the
                    time because every spring they brought in students as temporary help. They
                    needed extra people to deal with the additional work caused by people traveling
                    in the summer. So I, college graduate, former sales person with the Owens
                    Illinois Glass Company and former resident of Paris, France, got a job with the
                    State Department as a GS-3, putting pictures on passports.</p>
                <p>One evening, at about that same time, while waiting in a movie line, I ran into a
                    fellow whom I knew in high school. He was a student at the George Washington
                    University law school. His roommate had just gotten married, so my high school
                    friend was looking for someone to share the cost of his apartment. I moved in
                    with him at his apartment near the corner of 21st and I St, N.W. And I went to
                    work in passport production near the space occupied until recently by the Credit
                    Union at the bottom of the escalator. Meanwhile, I spent my free time trying to
                    see what might be done about getting a job as a courier. I just thought being a
                    courier would be the most marvelous job in the world.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>While putting pictures on passports, I got to know Ted Kroll who had been hired
                    by the State Department to be a communicator. Ted had been a Marine guard in
                    Buenos Aires and later graduated from college. He wanted to be a courier too,
                    bubecause of the number of people in line waiting to be considered for this johe
                    had been dissuaded from expecting to get a courier job any time soon. He had
                    basically been told that he could be a State Department communicator, then,
                    after a tour or two, “perhaps you can apply for the courier job.” Ted and I
                    began to hang out together.</p>
                <p>But then, without warning one day, he was called by a personnel person who said,
                    “Look, we've got an unexpected opening. If you'd like to be a courier, we could
                    offer that to you right now.” Of course, he accepted. This was on a Friday in
                    July 1962. He was asked to go to Personnel the following Monday to take care of
                    whatever paperwork was necessary to change his assignment from communications to
                    courier.</p>
                <p>When he got there that Monday, the personnel officer said something like, “Darn,
                    all of a sudden a guy just called and canceled his acceptance of the job we
                    offered him as a courier. And I promised I'd have a replacement courier in place
                    in Frankfurt a week from today,” which was the following Monday, seven days
                    later. “Where am I going to find somebody so quickly?”</p>
                <p>Tebless his hearsaid, “What about Ed Wilkinson?” She said, “I remember that
                    name.” Ted said, “You talked to him about being a courier, too.” “Where is he
                    right now?” she asked. “He's two floors below right where we are.” “Well,” said
                    the Personnel Officer, “ask him to come and see me.” That was on a Monday, and a
                    week later I was in Frankfurt as a courier.</p>
                <p>Can you believe that? Again, this was just sheer good luck.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time you wouldn't have had any particular
                        clearance or anything else like that, would you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I had by then some sort of a clearance for my passport work. Perhaps
                    that was good enough, at least to get started. Also, by then I had taken
                    something called the Federal Service Entrance Exam, and was on my way to
                    becoming a civil servant. I suppose for that reason they had started procedures
                    for a full clearance. Of course, I imagine clearances in those days were not
                    quite so thorough as what is done today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Frankfurt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I went to Frankfurt as a courier in August of '62. I might say that by
                    that point I had takebut had not passethe FSO exam.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, by this time, you really had your sights set on the
                        Department of State in an overseas capacity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, with emphasis on the phrase, “overseas capacity.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a good way to get there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you a courier?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I was a courier for two tours, a little over four years. The first two
                    years, I was stationed in Frankfurt. Because the Frankfurt courier office was a
                    relatively large operation, and because they had much smaller operations in
                    Panama and in Manila, generally persons assigned to Frankfurt ended up doing two
                    back-to-back tours there. But in my case, for whatever reason, I only did one
                    tour in Germany and then was sent to Manila for my second tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about the system of couriers in the
                        '60s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Because of international agreements, if you are certified by your
                    country as being a professional courier, you are able to take diplomatic pouches
                    through other countries' customs procedures without their being inspected. Of
                    course, there is a distinction between your suitcase, your personal items, and
                    the pouches, which are sealed. So you go from point A, to point B, to point C,
                    carrying the diplomatic pouch with an official certificate designating you as an
                    official diplomatic courier. These procedures are spelled out in the Vienna
                    Conventions on Diplomatic Relations. So the courier is responsible for moving
                    official diplomatic mail from the U.S. tand betweediplomatic and consular posts
                    abroad.</p>
                <p>As I said, in those days we had a large office in Frankfurt. There were about
                    eighty couriers in total worldwide, and I would say about fifty were in
                    Frankfurt in that time. As I indicated earlier, there was a much smaller office
                    in Manila and a smaller one yet in Panama. Of course, many of the pouches
                    originated in Washington, but most of those were carried by the U.S. military to
                    our offices in Panama, Manila and Frankfurt. We professional State Department
                    couriers rarely did go back to Washington in those days. Out of the Frankfurt
                    office, we serviced all of Eastern and Western Europe, as far east as Moscow. We
                    also traveled over most of Africa and the Middle East, as far east as Tehran, so
                    you can see we covered a lot of territory.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>You would be given a certain number of pouches on a trip route, then be met at
                    the train station or at the airport by somebody from the embassy or consulate
                    where you would make your pouch exchange. Let's say you were passing by Brussels
                    and you had two bags for that embassy. The person from the embassy would come to
                    the airport or train station to meet you and would sign for them. And perhaps he
                    had one pouch for London and one for Washington. You would accept them, after
                    signing his receipt. All our routes were interconnected, so the bags would wend
                    their way to the designated destination by the most efficient route.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that, yes, you're overseas, but when you're
                        sitting on these canvas pouches, one, and two, you're hustling around,
                        you're really not getting a chance to see many things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, true, but you did occasionally get a chance to be a tourist,
                    though. One reason, of course, was that flights were virtually all on propeller
                    planes in those days. You went from A to B much slower than people do today, and
                    there were far fewer connecting flights. You could end up spending a night or
                    two in this town or a night or so in that town, waiting for the next plane out.
                    Therefore, you might have a chance to see things in the places where you were
                    scheduled to stop. I felt very fortunate to have seen many, many things in many,
                    many places that the average American simply had no chance to see.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you looking towards anything beyond that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: At that point, no. The couriers with whom I associated were mostly
                    people very much like me. I found sort of a built-in group of friends, and I'm
                    still in contact with many of them. I'm fond of saying, and I'll repeat here,
                    that when I die and arrive at the Golden Gate and St. Peter asks, “Who are you,”
                    I'm going to tell him nothing more, nothing less than, “I'm a former U.S.
                    diplomatic courier.” This experience was a defining part of my life, in a
                    certain sense. And I made a lot of good friends in those days. It was a
                    wonderful life for a single 26-plus-year-old.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do on these trips? Did you read?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, I had a lot of chance to read. And, of course you have to do a
                    certain amount of paperwork and planning. You really have to spend quite a bit
                    of time paying attention to what you're doing. With large loads of pouches that
                    were often carried in the hold of the plane, you often had to prepare a plan of
                    action to get off the airplane to get down on the ground near the plane's hold
                    to watch them. But, yes, there was plenty of time for reading.</p>
                <p>And other things, too. I can remember one night in Vienna going to see the opera,
                    Aida. I got a seat very close to the front of the Staatsoper. This was the sort
                    of thing we also had an opportunity to do, occasionally.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was looking after the pouches?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Oh, the pouches were deposited at the embassy for the night. I might
                    add that courier stopovers in Vienna in those days were very often, the
                    beginning or the end of train trips behind the Iron Curtain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have any real problems? I'm talking about the
                        European thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: No. In the big scheme of things, no. I suppose one little problefrom a
                    courier point of viethat sticks out in my mind is that during one trip a fellow
                    courier and I were coming back from Bucharest by train. (We couriers always
                    traveled in pairs behind the Iron Curtain.) The courier schedule had us stop in
                    Budapest just for a couple minutes while the passengers got on and off the
                    train. People from the embassy came to the station and made a pouch exchange.
                    Then we couriers were to continue on with the train to Vienna. Well, coming from
                    Bucharest we arrived at the border between Romania and Hungary, the towns were
                    Curtici in Romania and Orosh�za, Hungary. I can remember it like it was
                    yesterday.</p>
                <p>The Hungarian immigration official said (in German, the Lingua Franca behind the
                    Curtain), “Your visas are no good.” And sure enough a mistake had been made. It
                    was not our fault as it turns out, except that we hadn't looked at the visas
                    closely, which in any case were written in Hungarian. We had no choice but to
                    get off the train. Now in a certain sense, this was a very interesting spot, at
                    least it was in those days. The little train station at the Romanian-Hungarian
                    border looked like something like a scene out of an old western movie. There was
                    a covered, wooden sidewalk and windows in the old buildings with curtains over
                    them. Well, it turns out this was all fake. You could open the one door that
                    worked and go in behind. Behind there was virtually nothing, except the customs
                    and immigration shack and some hovels.</p>
                <p>We were stopped on the Hungarian side now, even though we hadn't officially
                    entered their country. I must say, they were really very nice to us. Finally, we
                    were able to communicate by telephone with our embassy in Bucharest and the
                    problem ultimately was straightened out.</p>
                <p>We took a later train on to Budapest, which was wonderful because no courier in
                    recent memory had stopped in Budapest. We went to the embassy to deliver and
                    store the pouches, the first couriers to do that in years. There we were treated
                    with an opportunity to see, although we didn't talk to, Cardinal Mindszenty. As
                    you may remember, he spent many years in that embassy as a political refugee. He
                    had sort of a little patio affair inside the embassy next to his quarters. When
                    we arrived, he was walking around out there. We waved “hello” to him, which he
                    acknowledged.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>The next day we went on to Vienna. Except for the Mindszenty part and the
                    opportunity to see a little bit of the beautiful city of Budapest, this little
                    contretemps didn't turn out to be much. So I must say, in the four years I was a
                    courier, I really didn't have any problems to report.</p>
                <p>I might add that I was in Moscow the night President Kennedy was shot. We took
                    the train from Moscow Station at midnight that night to Helsinki. I still get a
                    little bit choked up thinking about it. First of all, upon leaving the Soviet
                    Union, the Russian border guard tried his best to explain what had happened from
                    his standpoint. Unfortunately, his English was minimal, and as neither of us
                    understood Russian, we didn't glean much about the matter while there. We'd had
                    word of the shooting, of course, but we didn't have a lot of information. We had
                    been able to listen to some sketchy reports on the BBC before leaving Moscow,
                    but we had no way to listen after leaving Moscow.</p>
                <p>When we got to the Finnish side, the border guard in charge there was a former
                    Finnair pilot whose English was perfect. He told us everything that had happened
                    that he had seen on television before coming to work. On the way to Helsinki
                    from the border, you could see that many buildings had Finnish flags at
                    half-staff. The Finnish people we saw were clearly sorrowful. I must say, some
                    forty years later it still chokes me up to remember the way these people
                    demonstrated how they felt about the assassination. I spent the nighthat is, the
                    night after the President's murdein Helsinki, then took a plane the next day
                    down to Frankfurt. Because the pouches were in the hold of the plane, I got up
                    to my seat on the Finnair flight to Frankfurt just before the plane's departure.
                    When people realized I was an American (given away, I suppose, by my accent when
                    speaking with the flight hostess), they came out of the woodwork, so to speak,
                    to give me the English-language newspapers to read. Everybody on board was just
                    as solicitous they could possibly have been. The International Herald-Tribune
                    had a black border all around the front page. Once again, I was choked up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After two years they sent you to the Philippines?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, I was transferred to the Philippines in November of '64. Out of
                    Manila, we traveled down to Australia and to many parts of Southeast Asia, as
                    far west as Karachi and Peshawar. We didn't go to China, though, a country we
                    didn't recognize at the time. Nor did we go to Japan, Korea or Taiwan, all of
                    which were serviced by the U.S. military courier service.</p>
                <p>Manila was, of course, quite different from Frankfurt, a very different place,
                    altogether. I must say I quickly fell in love with Asia.</p>
                <p>When I got to that part of the world, I felt like I had, in a certain sense, come
                    home. I don't know why. And let me add here that in March of 1965, I met the
                    wonderful woman who was later to become my wife. We didn't get married for some
                    years, but we hit it off, I would say, right away. Her name is Alicia, but she
                    was known by many people in Manila as Lisa.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was her background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, she was born and raised in Bacolod City in the central
                    Philippines, in Negros Occidental. She had graduated from the University of
                    Philippines in Greater Manila, as did her parents before her. Upon graduation,
                    she stayed in Manila to work. She first got a job with the Philippine
                    government, but by the time I met her she was working for Scandinavian Airlines
                    as a ticket agent.</p>
                <p>One little interesting point about my wife, I think, is that as I mentioned
                    earlier, my parents subscribed to National Geographic magazine. I used to clip
                    coupons to send for information about other places. Well, Lisa's parents, too,
                    subscribed to National Geographic magazine and she, too, used to clip the
                    coupons and sent them off to get information about far away places. She did
                    this, I think, for the same reason I did: a fascination with travel and with
                    other places. So if there was ever a marriage made in heaven, ours might very
                    well be it.</p>
                <p>Also, I might add that for a limited number of years they had, at the University
                    of Philippines, a School of Foreign Service. (I don't know why they eliminated
                    if from the curriculum, but they did.) Anyway, my wife graduated from U. P. with
                    a Bachelor of Science degree in Foreign Service. We dated during my tour in
                    Manila, but at the end of two years, I went off to my next assignment.
                    Fortunately for me, we got back together later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After four years of courier service it gets pretty long. I
                        mean this is fine at a certain age, but were you thinking of moving on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I had taken the FSO exam on two or three occasions and I kept coming
                    close, but I never passed. It was getting a little frustrating. What happened,
                    however, is this. Sometime in the spring of 1966, I think it was, it was decided
                    that we couriers would no longer travel in the first class section of airplanes.
                    Now the idea of traveling first class was not because we needed the first class
                    treatment, but rather to be able to get on and off airplanes much easier, much
                    more quickly than if you're in economy. This was, of course, very important in
                    that our classified diplomatic pouches were almost always carried in the hold of
                    the airplane. But in the spring of 1966, somebody decided that for budgetary
                    reasons there was to be no more first class for couriers. This was partly the
                    reason why I began to think moving on to another area of the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Just about the time the “no more first class” word came out, I was fortunate to
                    take a special courier trip all the way out to Frankfurt. While there I met an
                    old courier friend, Dick Luchesa. Dick had been in contact with a former courier
                    who was then a personnel officer in the Latin American Division of the State
                    Department. The personnel man, as it turns out, was recruiting couriers to
                    become consular officers.</p>
                <p>The reason, as I understood it, was that there were thought to be too many vacant
                    consular positions, at least in Latin America. Personnel was actively seeking
                    qualified people to fill at least some of these position. Because most couriers
                    were college graduates, this officer felas I got the storthat the courier
                    service was a pool of people where they might be able to recruit Foreign Service
                    people who might be able to fill these vacant positions.</p>
                <p>As soon as I got back to Manila, I communicated with the officer in Personnel,
                    and, to make a long story short, I applied for and was accepted as what was
                    called in those days a “staff officer.” I was to do consular work in a Foreign
                    Service officer position, but not as an FSO.</p>
                <p>So in the Spring of 1967, after, I think, some eleven weeks of Spanish language
                    training and a little consular training, I went off to our consulate in
                    Mazatl�n, a little town in Mexico, for my first assignment as vice consul.
                    Frankly, I found the work fascinating and I decided I wanted to stay with it.
                    Later I had the opportunity to become a regular Foreign Service Officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you quit the courier business to become a consular
                        officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, although I didn't know what a consular officer was, to be honest.
                    I inquired of some consular officers in Manila what they did, but, frankly, I
                    applied for the job without really knowing what it entailed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much training did you get in consular work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Two weeks. Mazatl�n at that time was a two-officer post. We did
                    nothing, essentially, but American Services and non-immigrant visas. The two
                    weeks of consular training, which was all that was provided new consular
                    officers at the time, consisted of three days in American Services and two days
                    in non-immigrant visas, plus an entire week reviewing immigrant visas, which we
                    didn't do in Mazatl�n. So I went off to my first consular posting with five days
                    of useful training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Mazatl�n from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I got there in May of '67 and I was there until July, I think it was,
                    of 1969.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Mazatl�n like? I mean, where is it located?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Mazatl�n is a port city on the west coast of Mexico. It was, and is, a
                    fishing center. Shrimp is the main thing. If you picture a map of Mexico, think
                    of Baja California coming down on the left side. From the bottom tip of the
                    Baja, you just go straight across to the mainland, a little bit north maybe, and
                    there you will find Mazatl�n.</p>
                <p>It was a town of maybe 100,000 people at that time. It was, and continues to be,
                    a very popular tourist destination for Americans, Canadians and others. Some
                    were retirees, but mostly the American visitors were just plain tourists. It was
                    quite a nice place. Mexicans in general are just friendly, friendly people and I
                    certainly was extremely well treated there. And my boss and his wife were
                    wonderful, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: The consul was the late Abraham Vigil. He and his wife treated me
                    royally. I replaced a vice consul there whom I met only briefly, so Mr. Vigil
                    was stuck with teaching me everything. I had nothing but the greatest respect
                    for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would we have a consular post there? Protection and
                        Welfare?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, although we handled non-immigrant visas, protection and welfare
                    was what we spent most of our time doing. Partly, don't forget, communications
                    in those days were nothing like what we have today, so you couldn't solve
                    protection problems from a distance as easily as you can today. I might add that
                    the consular office at Mazatl�n was closed ten or so years ago, although there
                    is now a consular agency there. The town is still a very popular place for
                    tourists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about those days, in the late '60s, an American
                        gets into trouble. What kind of trouble and what did you do? How did the
                        system work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, in those days, and I'm sorry to say it's not all that different
                    today, many of our countrymen's problems were drug related. The difference is we
                    tended to focus on marijuana, whereas today it's on harder drugs. But it's the
                    same old business; too many people think they can just go down to Mexico and,
                    with impunity, do whatever they want. Now, there is a great deal of freedom that
                    exists in that country that we don't have in the States, but it is by no means a
                    free lunch. So you had a regular, steady stream of people who went to jail,
                    mostly for drug-related reasons.</p>
                <p>You also had a number of natural deaths to attend to because a large percentage
                    of foreign tourists who came to the resort town were older people. What you did
                    in those days in a death case is not all that different from what must be done
                    today. Unless there is a close relative on the spot available to attend to
                    details, you arrange to deal with the remains, and you work with the police to
                    get the deceased's belongings and ensure that that they are returned to the
                    family. You try your best to follow the wishes of the next-of-kin, and you do
                    that under State Department rules and regulations, but most of the work is
                    simply common sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Americans that get arrested? One hears,
                        particularly in those days, about the problem of corruption, the
                        bribes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Oh, yes, “la mordita” existed then, and it still exists.</p>
                <p>Q: When somebody got into jail, how did you deal with that?</p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I don't think there were many arrests of people who understood the
                    system. It wasn't impossible to arrange for an alternative to going to jail, if
                    you had the funds and knew how to play the game. So, the potential was there; I
                    don't deny it. I read an article recently, in, I think, the New York Times on
                    that same issue. It's still going on. I certainly didn't deal in it in any way,
                    shape, or form, but I knew it happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the time of a lot of young students, many called
                        hippies, going out to explore the world. It was very much the thing to take
                        a year off and the dollar went pretty far and you could hitch hike around
                        and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: You know, we didn't see a lot of the hippy-type people there, simply,
                    I think, because that type of person didn't want go to a place where there were
                    a lot of American senior citizen tourists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, good point.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: Young, more serious, people went to places like San Miguel de Allende
                    and similar locations where there are schools to study Spanish. But they didn't
                    go Mazatl�n to study the language. Of course, we saw students, though. Oh, we
                    just dreaded the spring school break, and for the same reason any Mexican who
                    could put two pesos together got out of town during the pre-Lenten holiday
                    period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The kids would all come in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, kids and everybody else. It was kind of a mess. But, of course,
                    the local people, the shop owners, and for that matter the police and the civil
                    authoritieeverybodliked it because it produced a lot of income for the town.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about getting people in jail? Did you have any
                        problems taking care of them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: No, no, not at all. Many young kids who came to town got caught buying
                    marijuana. They did a minimum of two years, and very often it was exactly two
                    years. Often the sentence was four years, but normally the Mexican authorities
                    would let the kids out after two. One exception I remember was an American
                    citizen convicted for murder. I think he was in jail for life. He died of
                    natural causes in jail while I was there. Except for him, I don't think there
                    was a soul incarcerated in Mazatl�n during my tenure there who was an American
                    who wasn't in jail for some drug-related offense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Mexican community?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I liked them very much. They were and are very friendly people. There
                    was a restaurant that is still there called El Shrimp Bucket, situated in the
                    Hotel La Siesta. El Shrimp Bucket employed a group of waiters most of whom had
                    been in the States for a time, and their English was pretty good. El Shrimp
                    Bucket was owned by an American by the name of Carlos Anderson. The food was
                    pretty good, and it was an amazing place in the sense of the atmosphere. Carlos
                    would almost inevitably “buy” you one or two Kaluas after dinner. It was a very
                    friendly, happy place and I spent a great deal of time there, as did many, many
                    tourists, and not a few Mexicans. Carlos later opened restaurants in a number of
                    places all over Latin America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, so you were there for two years, fro'69 to '71? By
                        the way, what was your status by that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: My marital status?</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, your professional status.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, professionally, I spent a lot of years as a vice consul staff
                    officer at a fairly low grade. I think at about that point I was some five years
                    without a promotion.</p>
                <p>The reason I jumped on the phrase “marital status” is that during my last weeks
                    in Mazatl�n, Listhe Filipina I met in Manila, Alicia or Lisand I got married. We
                    got married in a civil ceremony in Mexico City, then later, during the last
                    weeks of this tour in Mexico, got married in Mazatl�n in a religious
                    ceremony.</p>
                <p>My next assignment was in San Jos�, Costa Rica, where both our children were
                    born. I spent two years in Costa Rica doing quite similar things as I did in
                    Mazatl�n, although we did have immigrant visas in San Jos�. For essentially the
                    same reasons as in Mazatl�n, Costa Rica was also a busy tourist place for
                    American travelers. Nothing like today, perhaps, but under standards of those
                    days it was quite busy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So who was the ambassador at the time in San Jos�?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I was there just two years, and probably during fifteen months of that
                    time, our ambassador was Walter C. Plaser. Ambassador Plaser had been an
                    ambassador before in Paraguay before. When we arrived, Mr. Sandy Pringle was
                    Charg� d'Affaires.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the consular work like? Were you the only
                        consular officer there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: No, I had a boss, Consul Jim Kerr. It was just two of us there in the
                    consular section during the vast majority of my time in San Jos�. After I spent
                    several months as vice consul under Jim Kerr, Mr. Plaser arrived as ambassador.
                    Because he didn't speak Spanish, Ambassador Plaser asked for a full-time
                    interpreter. Well, at small posts like that, the State Department doesn't
                    provide a professional interpreter. So to try to be helpful, Personnel found a
                    vice consul in Monterrey, Mexico, Jos� Fernandez, a Puerto Rican, who's Spanish,
                    of course, was perfectly fluent. The idea was that I would go to back up to
                    Monterrey and take Jos�'s place, and Jos� would transfer to San Jos�, replace me
                    and be vice consul as well as be the ambassador's interpreter when needed.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>On the very day that I heard about this plan, I found that my wife Lisa was
                    pregnant with our first child. So, as it turns out, somebody else replaced Jos�
                    in Monterrey, and I ended up as the number two general services officer, a
                    position that fortunately for me became vacant about that time. Jos� arrived in
                    San Jos� and replaced me as vice consul, and I spent about six months as
                    assistant GSO. Then when the consul, Jim Kerr, was transferred, I went back to
                    the consular section. So for the last four or five months of my tour in Costa
                    Rica, Jos� and I were the two consular officers there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was consular work like in Costa Rica?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: It was a bigger variation of what we did in Mazatl�n in the sense that
                    there were a relatively large number of tourists who came there and got
                    themselves into trouble. And we did more non-immigrant visas as well as have an
                    immigrant visas operation. All told, it was the kind of work we were doing in
                    many, many places over the world in those days. But between the two of us and
                    our Costa Rican staff, it was manageable.</p>
                <p>We certainly lived a fairly decent life in Costa Rica. I can recall one evening
                    being called by the duty officer who had a problem he wasn't sure how to handle
                    with an American who had been arrested. I went over to a nearby jail to find the
                    arrested American. He was in the “tank” with twenty or thirty other people,
                    mostly drunks. Apart from being drunk and, I assume, disorderly, the American
                    had some sort of a medical problem. The police recognized that he had a problem.
                    They were willing just to let him to go back to his hotel and get out of their
                    hair, but they wanted somebody to come and get him. So I went over there and the
                    rest was easy. I took him to his hotel without further problems. But, what an
                    experience to see the number of drunks in the tank. I suppose it's the sort of
                    thing the police everywhere deal with every Saturday night of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it's probably a good time to stop and we'll pick
                        this up next time. When did you leave Costa Rica?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: We left there in January of '72. Our two children, Thomas and Anna
                    Lisa, were born there. As a “staff” officer, I was not on the diplomatic list
                    so, under Costa Rican law, jus soli, both children acquired Costa Rican
                    citizenship, as well as U.S. citizenship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Buenos Aires, Argentina.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ed, you were in Buenos Aires from '72 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: From January of '72 until August of '75, about three years, nine
                    months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Vice consul, and I was promoted to consul during the end of my tour
                    there. I did everything that the consular officers do during my tour there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you see Argentina in the '72 period when you were
                        assigned there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: The security situation was not at all good because there were
                    revolutionaries in Argentina at the time. We had many travel restrictions,
                    although usually we were free to move around the city any time we wanted.</p>
                <p>Because there were serious anti-Argentine government revolutionaries around,
                    though, bombs went off and people were shot. The American consular agent in the
                    town of Mendoza was kidnaped and murdered during our tour in Argentina. A bomb
                    exploded in front of the British embassy just after the Queen's birthday
                    celebration. So, it was not a nice situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the government like at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: It was in those days, as it was all too often all over in Latin
                    America, a dictatorship. In fact, when we arrived, the president of the country,
                    Alejandro Lanusse, was a general who acquired the presidency essentially simply
                    by being a general. But I think, nevertheless, he was a good man in certain
                    ways. Lanusse had announced publicly that he would hold a regular election, one
                    that was going to result in the people deciding who would be the next leader of
                    Argentina. And that happened.</p>
                <p>The election took place the following year. A dentist by the name of H�ctor
                    C�mpora won, but while running for president he made no bones about the fact
                    that he was really running as a stand in for Juan Per�n. P�ron, you may
                    remember, was living in exile in Spain at the time. Anyway, C�mpora won the
                    election and became president, but within a few weeks of his election, he simply
                    announced that there would be new elections, which took place. Juan P�ron won
                    practically without opposition. C�mpora effectively turned over the presidency
                    to P�ron.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wow?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, amazing. So P�ron became president and his wife, Isabelita,
                    became vice president. This would have been sometime toward the end of the year
                    1973.</p>
                <p>As far as life in Argentina was concerned, frankly, for those of us who had
                    dollars to spend, we lived quite well. If you've been in Argentina, you know
                    exactly what I'm talking about and, if not, it's a little hard to describe.
                    Argentina is a first class country in many, many ways. It was and is a country
                    with wonderful food, spectacular cultural events of all sorts, libraries, and a
                    beautiful opera house with regular presentations of opera, ballet, concerts and
                    the like.</p>
                <p>Because the city of Buenos Aires is in the southern hemisphere, we had European,
                    American and other opera and ballet stars from the North during their
                    off-season, June, July and August. That, of course, is the “on-season” in
                    Argentina. So we saw some fantastic things at the opera house there and because
                    the money situation was not good for the Argentine, we were able to obtain
                    tickets relatively inexpensively. To repeat: we lived very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must've been a major topic of conversation. Why
                        couldn't the Argentines get their act together? They had almost everything
                        going; they didn't have an Indian population to worry about and it is not a
                        poor country in terms of resources.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: All true, all true. That question you probably should put in the
                    present tense, because it appears they still haven't really gotten their act
                    together. It's a little hard to understand why. In our day, I think Argentina
                    produced 40% of the oil the country needed. Of course, the earth in Argentina is
                    extremely rich. I believe I read somewhere that the topsoil is 23 feet deep
                    there because there were no glaciers in the Southern Hemisphere.</p>
                <p>The European immigrants, who are the Argentines of today, were educated people.
                    Exactly why they have such basically fiscal, but certainly government-wide,
                    problems, I can't answer. It is surprising. You think each time it's turning
                    around, but, it doesn't. The minister of economics who is there even right now,
                    Domingo Caballo, is a highly educated person. He was economics minister ten
                    years ago, and all things seem to have gone well economically speaking, but
                    they've just had another disaster there financially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to the consular work, who was the ambassador
                        while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: When we arrived, John Davis Lodge was the ambassador. John Davis Lodge
                    was not nearly so well known as his younger brother, Henry Cabot Lodge.
                    Ambassador Lodge was later ambassador to Switzerland. He left and was replaced
                    by Robert C. Hill.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>Ambassador Hill was on his fifth assignment as ambassador. He was a man of
                    independent means who had a good handle on what he was doing and why he was
                    doing it. I thought he was just a wonderful ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about consular work there. What was it
                        like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: It was a pretty standard, almost a textbook operation. With the
                    exception of people who were in the country temporarily with companies, the
                    Americans who lived there tended to be long-term residents. In many cases, they
                    were born there and continued to make Argentina home. Therefore, they did not
                    need lots of consular services. Neither the immigrant visa nor the non-immigrant
                    visa programs were all that large, either. I must say, though, that the
                    non-immigrant visa business was often interesting because of the economic
                    situation. As far as our American staff was concerned, I think we were six
                    consular officers there, including the consul general.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the students? Didn't Argentina in those days
                        look towards Europe more than towards the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, that's true. There was quite a large British population, or
                    people of British origin, in Argentina, and they tended to go to Britain for
                    holidays and for study. The Italians were a little different story. They would
                    go to France and Spain as quickly as to Italy, but Europe was of course “home,”
                    if you will. I think the city of Buenos Aires is something like 90% of Italian
                    origin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about protection and welfare?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, this was not a big problem either in terms of quantity or in
                    terms of quality. Argentina is a Latin country, but by Latin standards the
                    situation there is far better than in many other places where I've served. That
                    is to say, the authorities were generally pretty honest. So, if you have an
                    authority you can deal witI'm talking about police, magistrates and judges, etc.
                    who are by and large decent, law-abiding people, your problems are not
                    significant.</p>
                <p>There was one particular situation I dealt with which was interesting. Now this
                    was, don't forget, in the '70s. There was a young woman of Hispanic origin who
                    came to Argentina as a part of a protest. I confess I've forgotten what she was
                    protesting about, but she was out in a provincial town leading marches and
                    making lots of noise in her protests. She was arrested for reasons that we all
                    thought were pretty shaky. A well-known (at least at that time) American lawyer,
                    Leonard Weinglass (of the “Chicago Seven” trial fame), came down to try to see
                    what he could do about getting her out of jail.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So she was from the American left establishment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: She was certainly leftist, as was Mr. Weinglass. Now, he knew
                    perfectly well that the Napoleonic Code legal system in Argentina is quite
                    different from the American English Common Law system, and that there was not
                    much he could bring in terms of his own legal experience. However he had been
                    asked to come down to “represent” her and so he did. He and I went to visit her.
                    And this is an example of why I say we really didn't have a lot of trouble with
                    Argentine authorities. Weinglass was not the young lady's lawyer, but the
                    Argentines allowed him to visit her on at least two different occasions.
                    Frankly, I thought they were pretty nice about it. We went to see the judge in
                    charge of the case, and - can you believe this? - he invited us to his home for
                    a very nice lunch.</p>
                <p>I thought all Argentines bent over backwards to be decent to us, so I bring that
                    up as an example of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to get her out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, she was finally released.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the security situation at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Traveling out of the city of Buenos Aires was difficult because of
                    embassy rules as a result of the very dire security situation. You could travel
                    under certain circumstances, but you had to get permission. The only visit my
                    wife and children and I made out of the city within Argentina was a trip
                    straight south to the resort town of Mar del Plata, where we spent two glorious
                    weeks just being tourists.</p>
                <p>I should point out that when we arrived in Buenos Aires our daughter was six
                    weeks old and our son was fifteen months, so getting around for tourist purposes
                    was not all that easy. Having two children in diapers did not make tourism so
                    desirable for us. On the other hand, Buenos Aries is a huge city. I've forgotten
                    now, but it seems there were ten million inhabitants at the time. There were
                    many, many things to do, so we didn't feel that we were deprived, necessarily,
                    because we couldn't conveniently leave the city.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the embassy and embassy personnel at all targeted by
                        the terrorists? Were these kidnapings politically motivated or were they
                        money motivated?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: Like altogether too many times in too many places, the American
                    Embassy, and I must say many other embassies, were targeted, particularly if
                    they were high profile. I think this was largely because such attacks would
                    bring publicity that the revolutionaries wanted. I cannot think of a situation
                    where money was an issue. They simply wanted the publicity.</p>
                <p>We had one major terrorist incident while we were there. A pickup truck stopped
                    at a stop light right outside the ambassador's residence (a beautiful old home,
                    by the way). Welded into the back of the pickup truck were bazookas. For
                    whatever reason publicity for their cause, I assumthe people in the open truck
                    were able to fire the bazooka, and they did so when the light changed green.
                    They fired several shots, then sped away. A number of shells went right into the
                    outside wall of the ambassador's residence. There was some damage, but nobody
                    was hurt, so they got away with that one with relatively little trouble for
                    us.</p>
                <p>Another thing I might mention was something I referred to a little while ago. One
                    night my wife and I were in bed reading. The kids were asleep. I suppose it was
                    ten o'clock at night. We heard a huge boom. It turned out to have been an
                    explosion at the British Embassy that was eight or ten blocks away from where we
                    were living. This particular day was the Queen's birthday.</p>
                <p>Somebody had pulled a car right up next to the British Embassy earlier in the
                    evening. Apparently something didn't go right with the bomb planted in the car,
                    because by the time of the explosion the celebration was finished, and the
                    guests had left. An embassy guard noticed some strange lights in the car near
                    the dashboard. The car was loaded with explosives, and when the guard tried to
                    determine the cause of the lights, it exploded. With the exception of the
                    unfortunate guard, nobody was hurt.</p>
                <p>These were two of the security matters that I remember, but lamentably there was
                    a steady stream of nasty occurrences.</p>
                <p>Another little story: One night my wife and I and a couple of friends went to
                    dinner someplace and then went to have a drink after the dinner. We went to a
                    section of town called the Recoleta, which is near the famous cemetery of the
                    same name and near a university. It's a very nice neighborhood of bars,
                    restaurants, and so on. To our amazement, when we pulled up to a main
                    intersection, there were a number of anti-Argentine government revolutionaries
                    with guns there. A couple of them were actually directing traffic; they and had
                    basically taken over the neighborhood. We, however, were so used to this kind of
                    thing that we went through the intersection, found a parking place and had our
                    drinks. By the time we were ready to leave, these guys had been chased out. It
                    was a bit surrealistic.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The consular section often is the place where people come

                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: A good question. I think the answer is no. I can't remember a
                    situation like that. Needless to say, I was pretty junior; I wasn't necessarily
                    privy to everything that might have happened, but I'm not aware that there
                    was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there demonstrations against the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: No. There were not. But let me tell a little story here, the likes of
                    which most people have never seen.</p>
                <p>We talked earlier about the economic situation there, and I'm afraid the word
                    “mismanagement” leaps to mind. One of the things that the Argentine Central Bank
                    did during our time there was to promulgate a regulation that allowed travelers
                    who were going abroad for tourism to get monedollars or marks or yen or whatever
                    it was they would neeat a relatively favorable rate. This meant if you're a
                    person living in Argentina who had Argentine Pesos to spend and you wanted to go
                    to the U.S., you could get up to $1,500 at this favorable rate. You could get, I
                    think, 10% of the total in cash in Argentina, and the rest you would have to get
                    from a designated bank in the U.S. after arrival there. In order to qualify for
                    obtaining the rest of the $1,500, the traveler had to remain in the U.S. (or at
                    least, outside Argentina) for at least 30 days.</p>
                <p>It's a little odd that the Central Bank would do that because it effectively
                    encouraged tourism, i.e. spending your Argentine money outside of the country.
                    This is not my idea of a good way to manage the economic situation, especially
                    during an economic crisis.</p>
                <p>Of course, during the relatively short period of time this rule was in effect, it
                    made a huge difference in our non-immigrant visa operation. As you might expect,
                    a lot of people found it convenient to go to Miami, the closest U.S. city of any
                    size to Argentina, to take advantage of the opportunity to make a little
                    money.</p>
                <p>So if a potential traveler could get a visa, the normal procedure would be to
                    obtain the 10 percent of the $1,500 from the Central Bank in Buenos Aires,
                    purchase the ticket (on credit, of course, in Pesos), fly off to Miami, do the
                    paperwork, get the rest of the dollars from the bank in Miami, then quickly fly
                    back. However, the traveler couldn't enter Argentina again through the airport
                    in Buenos Aries, because if he did he would be in trouble with the Central Bank.
                    Remember, theoretically, the traveler was supposed to remain in the U.S. for 30
                    full days. The traveler would instead return from Miami to Montevideo, Uruguay,
                    then come across the Rio Plata using only his national identification card, a
                    regularly used procedure for travel to surrounding countries. Thirty days later
                    the traveler would go back to Montevideo using the ID card, then return to
                    Argentina “internationally,” that is, with a passport.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>The traveler would then have $1,500 in U.S. dollars, which could be changed on
                    the black market for about three or four times the locally available rate. Even
                    after paying off the Peso debts for the round trips to Miami and Montevideo, the
                    traveler would still have considerable cash in Pesos.</p>
                <p>A lot of people did that, but to do so they required a U.S. non-immigrant visa.
                    When they applied, it was not really reasonable for us to say, “No, you can't
                    have a tourist visa because your idea is to make money off a weird Central Bank
                    rule.” I mean, one of the main points of a non-immigrant visa interview is
                    simply to get to the bottom of the section 214(b) of the Immigration and
                    Nationality Act question, “Are you coming back?” And I expect in most cases they
                    probably were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They've got a much better reason to come back than
                        others.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Exactly. I remember one of the embassy drivers asked me, “Can I get a
                    visa?” and I said, “Well, look, I'm not going to guarantee you anything, but I
                    think you can.” First of all, he had a full-time job, and secondly, although he
                    didn't make an awful lot of money, he had a good reason to come home. So, we had
                    people practically breaking down the door to apply for visas. In fact, one
                    particular day the door was, indeed, broken down. It was knocked down because
                    the ancient building the consular section was in at the time didn't have strong
                    doors. The crowd gathered outside the door to the consular section (on the third
                    floor of the office building), and there was such a crush from behind as people
                    got off the elevator that the door literally fell down.</p>
                <p>So in Argentina, we experienced a lot of things that normally you don't get
                    involved in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the technical class? I mean the engineers and
                        doctors? Were there good employment opportunities??</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I think the answer to that is no. The Argentine of those days and I'm
                    sure todaand I suspect 150 years agwas a relatively well-educated person, so you
                    certainly had a technical class. You had professors of everything, from media to
                    literature, and doctors and lawyers and other professionals. However, there
                    weren't a lot of jobs. Most people, though, loved Argentina (just like they do
                    today), so there was not a lot of desire to find one's (financial, at least)
                    destiny abroad. I don't think that happened much then. It certainly happened,
                    but it wasn't a major phenomenon. In fact, I don't think our non-immigrant visa
                    refusal rate was very high.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now when Per�n came back, was there apprehension or people
                        running for cover?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: Quite the contrary. I have a little story about that.</p>
                <p>After C�mpora was elected, he removed the prohibition against Per�n being able to
                    return to Argentina, so Per�n did come back during the winter in Argentina, in
                    June or July of 1973. We had an Argentine maid at the time, a nice, very
                    hard-working lady. She told us something, I think, that a lot of people lose
                    track of when remembering Juan Per�n, and that is this: Per�n was, in the '30s,
                    a general. Later he was made minister of work. He became very well known during
                    that time, and the changes he made then were his opening later to become
                    president of his country.</p>
                <p>Let me explain further. Argentina, in the 30s and before, was anything but an
                    egalitarian society. You had rich people, but there were very few. They were
                    largely landowners and large business people who managed the country. And there
                    were a very large number of poor people. Workers, I'm talking maids and people
                    of low income or all too often no income, were badly, badly treated by the
                    system.</p>
                <p>As minister of labor, Per�n made a number of changes. For example, he allowed,
                    for the first time the existence of trade unions. He did a number of other
                    things that made life better for the man and the woman on the street. And his
                    first wife, Evita, was seen to band was, I believan important part of this. So
                    when he returned, the vast majority of the people who remembered pre-Per�n life,
                    and how bad it was, welcomed him. No matter what he may have done regarding
                    fleecing the country in a variety of ways and the other things that were pretty
                    shady, for these reasons, the average Argentine thought very highly of him right
                    up to the end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left there in '75?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: We left there in August of '75.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By that time you had ceased being a staff officer and
                        became a Foreign Service Officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Correct. The way it worked was this. In the late '60s Ambassador
                    William Macomber was responsible for writing a report called Diplomacy for the
                    '70s, a study that I believe came out in late '69 or early '70. One of the
                    conclusions drawn in the study was that there were a lot of Foreign Service
                    officer positions filled by staff people, not FSOs. As a consequence of some
                    personnel changes recommended in the report and adopted, every one of us staff
                    people who had been three years in an FSO position was given an opportunity to
                    apply to become a regular Foreign Service officer.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>I think quite a large number of applicants were taken in as FSOs under the
                    program, although not everybody. I had some friends who, surprisingly, in my
                    opinion, were not accepted. Anyway, sometime in 1974, I became an FSO. The money
                    was essentially the same and the work was exactly the same, but becoming an FSO
                    opened up larger opportunities for the future for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So after 1975?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: So in 1975 I had been three straight tours in Latin America. As you
                    know, I am married to an Asian woman, a Filipina. Two things happened that were
                    in our favor in terms of expanding our assignment horizons. Dr. Henry Kissinger,
                    the Secretary of State at the time, came up with an idea that allowed a
                    broadening of assignment possibilities. I've forgotten the acronym but?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: GLOP. It was basically Global Outlook Program or
                        something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Okay, thank you. That's exactly it: GLOP. So, I had, for that reason,
                    a very good opportunity to move on from Latin America. Of course, Asia was my
                    goal.</p>
                <p>People who might read this account or hear this tape who know the State
                    Department's personnel structure today will not believe the way it was in the
                    '70s. You essentially got a telegram one day saying, “Your next assignment is
                    thus and so?” and that's where you went and that was the end of that. (Well,
                    okay; things did happen behind the scenes, but, well... it is far more
                    democratic, if you will, today.) Anyway, the GLOP principal gave us an
                    opening.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, at that time I knew my career counselomy assignment gurpretty well,
                    so I communicated with her as I was approaching the end of my Buenos Aires tour.
                    I made a plea to go to Asia, mentioning my wife, of course. Rather quickly
                    thereafter, she advised that there would be an opening in Taipei for which I
                    might qualify. Well, fortunately for us, I got the assignment to the embassy
                    there. It was an embassy at the time.</p>
                <p>Because of a rapidly increasing workload, they had increased the consular section
                    by two new American positions, rather without warning. So another fellow and I
                    were assigned there more or less at the last moment, unfortunately without any
                    language training.</p>
                <p>Q: Who's that?</p>
                <p>WILKINSON: His name is Lynn Curtain. Lynn is now retired and living in
                    Manila.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>Anyway, we arrived in Taipei in the fall of 1975, just after 10/10, double ten,
                    they call it, the founding date of the Republic of China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: October tenth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Right. We couldn't arrive before that date because we wanted to spend
                    a couple of nights in the Grand Hotel, probably Taipei's most famous and most
                    elegant hotel at the time. (I believe mentioned when I met Lisa, she was working
                    for Scandinavian Airlines. She later worked for Civil Air Transport, the Taiwan
                    flag carrier, so she had already been to Taipei and had stayed at the Grand
                    Hotel.) Anyway, because of the quantity of people who were in Taiwan for “Double
                    Ten,” we had to wait to arrive on the twelfth in order to get two rooms at the
                    Grand Hotel.</p>
                <p>We were delighted to be assigned to a post so close to the Philippines. Although
                    I had been in Manila before, I had never met my wife's family. My boss, Thomas
                    F. Wilson, gave me two weeks off at Christmas, 1975, which was just six weeks
                    after our arrival. I'm so happy he did that. We went over to the Philippines,
                    and I was then able to meet my wife's family. We spent two weeks there, mostly
                    in Bacolod City, Negros Oriental, where Lisa's family lives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Taiwan from '75 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: The late summer of 1978. We were there three years, a normal
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the political and economic situation in Taiwan?</p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, Taiwan, at that time, was a police state. It probably isn't very
                    politically correct to say it quite like this, but, in fact, the Chiang Kai-shek
                    party, the Kuomintang, just basically ran it in the way they saw fit. They,
                    themselves, would decide who the next president was to be and then this person
                    would become the president. Period. There was a legislative body called the
                    Legislative Yuan. They were not by any means a democratic organization,
                    either.</p>
                <p>Things have changed there, in my opinion, very much for the better. But in a
                    certain sense, even at that time, the political situation was okay. I say this
                    because there was order in the streets.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>However, at that time we knew perfectly well that the United States Government
                    was soon going to withdraw recognition from the Republic of China and recognize
                    the mainland. And because the people in Taiwan knew that a withdrawal of
                    recognition was possible (even likely), we diplomats were all very well treated
                    by the populace, presumably to try to stave off the de-recognition. So, as I
                    say, we were treated very nicely by virtually everybody in that country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there when we officially de-recognized the
                        Republic of China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: No, we left about three months before that happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was assumed that everybody knew it was going to
                        happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, I think so. But, it was not, in my opinion, well handled. I don't
                    think the ambassador knew precisely when it was going to take place until he was
                    called out of a dinner partwhere he happened to be with the president of the
                    countrto be told that the U.S. Government was going to recognize mainland China
                    forthwith. This is according to a story I heard. I cannot confirm it absolutely.
                    As I say, all this took place about three months after we left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Leonard Unger, formerly ambassador to Thailand. A man who makes his
                    home, I believe, here in the Washington area, as we speak. He was and is a
                    wonderful gentleman, and I think very highly of him and his wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was consular work like there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Once again, I would have to say that this was pretty standard
                    operation. When I first got there I was put in charge of American Services. Most
                    of our consular work, though, was in immigrant and non-immigrant visas. Now, in
                    those days the Taiwanese couldn't just get a passport and go somewhere because
                    they wanted to. There were certain restrictions on foreign travel. The same sort
                    of thing was going on in Korea, I believe, at the same time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: This, in a certain sense, regulated our non-immigrant visa business.
                    Taiwan officialdom was very understanding and good to us. And as far as American
                    Services was concerned, like in Korea and like, I believe, in Japan, Taiwan had
                    a foreign affairs police, a police force that dealt solely with foreigners. One
                    of the conditions of being a member of this police force, I think, was to speak
                    either English or Japanese, hopefully both, as well as Mandarin and, in many
                    cases, Taiwanese. They were quite easy for us to deal with, so we had no real
                    difficulties in this regard.</p>
                <p>Yes, of course, we had people in jail, although don't forget when I was there we
                    had U.S. military still assigned to Taiwan. Americans who broke the law and were
                    incarcerated were almost always jailed side-by-side with the U.S. military
                    detainees. These were all people who had done something not too serious and were
                    serving, perhaps, a two-year sentence. These were not murderers or so on. Let me
                    put it this way, the U.S. military took very good care of their prisoners to the
                    extent even of putting a refrigerator out where their people were. Our people
                    were able to take advantage of these relatively good conditions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about visas? We always think of the Chinese anywhere
                        trying to get to the United States, particularly in Hong Kong there's so
                        much visa fraud. How was it running in Taiwan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: It's possible, of course, that we were badly fooled by the people who
                    applied for visas, but don't think there was a great deal of fraud or other
                    similar problems, visa-wise. There was the usual business of the occasional fake
                    birth certificate and there were fake job letters and like, but in general I
                    don't think there were a lot of these sorts of problems. I did not, by the way,
                    ever sit on the visa line there. Non-immigrant visa interviews were handled
                    almost exclusively by our Chinese-speaking officers, so I'm speaking
                    second-hand. But, I don't think we had a lot of problems.</p>
                <p>I believe it is fair to say there are many parallels between Taiwan and Korea at
                    the time. For example, there might have been people who would have liked to
                    leave Taiwan, maybe because they were anti-Kuomintang, for example. But these
                    were not people who could get passports, I would have to say our visa worboth
                    immigrant and non-immigranwas manageable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have had quite a bit of traffic in students
                        there, didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: No, not really. There were certainly student visa applicants, and I
                    always felt that this was very good for the U.S., but once again, the student
                    could not simply go and get a passport to study abroad. I don't recall this
                    being a major problem at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the American military was there a lot of marriage
                        with the local ladies?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes I think so, although I don't have a statistic to give you on that.
                    Unfortunately (for me), the word was in the Judge Advocate General office there
                    that a consular officer had to be a witness for the marriage to be valid in the
                    U.S. Of course, that's not true, but the troops would get very excited if there
                    wasn't a consular officer on hand to witness their wedding.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, there was only one place in Taiwan where a foreigner could get
                    married, and that was at the Taipei city hall. So, on two particular days a
                    week, we would be there at a designated time. The G.I.'s would bring their
                    documents later to the consulate, and we would do the necessary paperwork to
                    provide them with a “Consular Witness to Marriage.” That wasn't necessary for
                    the marriage to be legal, as you very well know, but we did it anyway.</p>
                <p>Years later, by the way, probably around 1993 when I was assigned to Bangkok, I
                    visited the home of a newly arrived officer whom I didn't know. After
                    introductions, we were invited to sit down. However, the host looked at me for a
                    few seconds, and then went into his bedroom without comment. He came back a few
                    seconds later with his Consular Witness to Marriage, a certificate I had
                    witnessed it in 1976!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you pick up from your local employees at all any sort
                        of tension between the Taiwanese and the mainland Chinese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Oh, yes. Well, I don't think we did get that sort of information from
                    our local employees, largely, I think, because they didn't think that would be a
                    good thing for them to comment about, at least not to us. Tension certainly
                    existed, however. I don't think we had any Foreign Service National employees at
                    the office in those days who were “Mainlanders,” i.e., people who had come from
                    Mainland China with Chiang Kai-shek, or their offspring. I think they were
                    mostly Taiwanese, if you will. The Mainlanders wouldn't be likely to have taken
                    a job in the embassy. Those people tended to be generals and senior business
                    people and government people, not “administrative”-type people.</p>
                <p>I guess I would have to say that the native Taiwanese people were fairly decently
                    treated by the Mainlanders, although there were some exceptions to that in
                    certain cases. I don't really think this was a horrible existence for them, but
                    there were certain limitations on where they could go and what they could do. I
                    mean that in terms of jobs and so on. Yes, there was tension. There's no
                    question about the fact that there was tension.</p>
                <p>We, at least those of us who didn't speak Chinese, had to deal with a population
                    of people where, if they spoke English, they had long since decided it would
                    just simply not be convenient to make too much noise about any tension. So we
                    knew it existed, but I can't give you good examples.</p>

                <p>WILKINSON: In 1978, to my surprise, I got a communication from my former boss, my
                    first consul general in Buenos Aries, Robert Bishton. Bob Bishton was looking
                    for somebody to run the consular section in Guayaquil, Ecuador, where he was
                    then consul general.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, he sent a message to me about the job, and I leaped at the
                    opportunity to work for him again. My wife made a very clever observation, I
                    thought, at the time. She said, “Well, we've always heard many uncomplimentary
                    things about Guayaquil, but Jane Bishton would never be there if it were that
                    bad. So, therefore, we know it is not bad.”</p>

                <p>WILKINSON: Exactly. In fact, he was buried there for a time. Later his remains
                    were taken back to New York.</p>
                <p>Regarding Guayaquil, well it is not Paris or Rome, of course, but it's a
                    satisfactory town, and certainly fever was not an issue when we were there. In
                    fact, I don't think there was any sort of an issue there. We had a good time. We
                    had a lot of Ecuadorian friends.</p>
                <p>In fact, it was a real sleeper post. When we got there, we were getting 20%
                    hardship differential at a time that Havana was getting 15%! The reason, in my
                    opinion, is that no one ever visited there, probably because of its reputation.
                    During my two and a half years in Guayaquil, we had only one congressman visit,
                    and that was only for an afternoon. Nobody else from the Congress and rarely
                    anyone from the Department found it convenient to visit Guayaquil, at least
                    during my tour. One exception: we were inspected around 1980. I was acting
                    principal officer at the time while we were between consuls general.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '78 until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: January of '79 to July of '81.</p>
                <p>Q: What was the political situation in Ecuador at that time?</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: Soon after I arrived in Ecuador, there was what I would call a fairly
                    free and fair election. The man who became president, Jaime Rold�s, was a young
                    lawyer who was, I think, a man who wanted the very best for his country.
                    Unfortunately, he and his wife were killed a couple years later in an airplane
                    crash. Mrs. Rold�s, by the way, was the sister of a more recent president who
                    was not quite so successful, Abdullah Bucarram. The Bucarrams were, in general,
                    a decent political family who happened to be of Lebanese origin.</p>
                <p>In any case, the political situation was, in my opinion okay. When we arrived
                    there another legacy of Latin America, the dictator, was going by the wayside.
                    Although Attorney Rold�s won the election, if his opponent had won I think the
                    country would still have been okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a solid distinction between the people of
                        Guayaquil and those in Quito?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Funny that you would mention that. Yes, the answer is yes,
                    absolutely.</p>
                <p>The reason I suggest the observation is funny is that I certainly would not have
                    thought to ask that, but it is absolutely true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you have lowlanders, uplanders, flatlanders?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, and I think in Ecuador it is fair to say the people of the north
                    are rather different from the people of the South. For example, when the
                    northerners think of going abroad, they generally think of going to Spain.
                    People in the south, however, where Guayaquil is located, tend to think of going
                    to the U.S. when they think of going “abroad.”</p>
                <p>Another thing: in the north the second person singular in Spanish is tu. In the
                    south the word of choice is vos. Two different words for the same concept...
                    pretty unusual, I would say, for a relatively small country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Italians have that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Oh, do they really? Okay.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>I can remember having been there only a week or maybe two weeks. I was walking
                    down the hall upstairs, not in the consular section. I passed by our telephone
                    operator who said, “Mr. Wilkinson, I wonder if you could talk to this man on the
                    phone.” Well, that's kind of odd for the telephone operator to get up from his
                    work place and effectively waylay me out in the hall. The telephone operator
                    said, “It is the Minister of Defense on the phone.” I said, “My goodness, are
                    you sure that this is the Minister of Defense, himself, calling to the
                    consulate?” The operator stood a second thinking about it and he said, “Well, he
                    speaks like a Serrano, a person from the mountainous north. He speaks like
                    somebody from Quito.” To him, that was good enough; this was clearly somebody
                    from the north who was on the phone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was consular work like there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Quito is a relatively small town, even though it's the seat of the
                    government. Our officers there dealt with a relatively small amount of consular
                    work. The bulk of the consular work was, statistically, in Guayaquil.</p>
                <p>To the extent that there were Americans living in Ecuador, the majority lived in
                    or near Guayaquil, or down on the coast. So American Services was a much bigger
                    operation in every way, than it was in Quito. And we had immigrant visas,
                    non-immigrant visas as well as American Services in Guayaquil.</p>
                <p>I might add that Guayaquil is where business tends to be in Ecuador; the banking
                    industry is in Guayaquil. Another big issue there is fishing; obviously it's
                    along the coast.</p>
                <p>I believe there were two consular officers assigned to Quito, at the time, and we
                    were six or seven in Guayaquil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any major consular problems there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: No, not really. However, one weekend an American died up in the town
                    of Cuenca, north and east of Guayaquil. The truck bringing his remains in the
                    casket that Friday afternoon was delayed, so the body missed the plane on which
                    it was scheduled to depart. So the casket spent the weekend on my desk because
                    there were no other planes leaving until Monday and no one could figure out
                    where to keep the body for the weekend. That wasn't really a difficult
                    situation, of course, but it was the best example I could come up with as a
                    “problem.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the status of the tuna wars when you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: There were indeed tuna wars, but those issues were handled out of the
                    embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was immigration from in Guayaquil? To where were
                        they headed? Do you know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: No, I don't have a good answer to that. I'm not aware that there are a
                    large number of people of Ecuadorian origin who live in, let us say Miami. Miami
                    always was one of the important places for travel when people in Latin America
                    went to the U.S., but in terms of numbers, again, I don't have an answer to
                    that.</p>
                <p>Q: How about the students?</p>
                <p>WILKINSON: No, there were not a lot of student applicants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was city life like in Guayaquil?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: There was not much was going on there, I have to say. There were a
                    couple of Chinese restaurants that I remember and one or two Italian
                    restaurants, but nothing to report that was particularly interesting.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most noteworthy thing I found was an American citizen who was a
                    barber in a local hotel. He had lost one of his arms in Korea. I have to say I
                    think a one-armed barber is news. He was a very nice, very personable gentleman.
                    He had immigrated to the States in 1950 and was promptly taken into the U.S.
                    military and sent to Korea where he lost his arm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any tourism going out to the Galapagos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, that, of course, was a big deal. There was an American man
                    resident in Guayaquil who had a good-sized schooner on which you could visit the
                    Galapagos. From Guayaquil, you could spend about six days on this tour. This
                    included, I think, three days or four days in the Galapagos, so you had nice
                    accommodations and a good cook. Travelers were able to experience, to a degree,
                    something like what Charles Darwin and others might have experienced in their
                    travel to the islands. The Galapagos was an important tourist attraction for
                    people, and Ecuador certainly took full advantage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any earthquakes or disasters or anything like
                        that while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: There were at least two earthquakes that I remember, although I don't
                    think they caused much damage. One happened during a normal workday. I was
                    having a meeting in my deputy's office when the building began to shake. I
                    really don't remember what happened next, but in an instant all four of us were
                    trying to stand in the doorway to his office. We all began to laugh even before
                    the shaking stopped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Peruvian-Ecuadorian border dispute pop up while
                        you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, it did, although I was out of the country at the time, so I
                    personally missed it all. I came up to the States in 1980 to attend the advanced
                    consular course. During this three-week period, the border war, if that's the
                    right phrase, took place. There were some rumors during this period to the
                    effect that the Peruvians were going to bomb Guayaquil. Nothing happened really,
                    but there was a good scare, and of course I was very concerned because my wife
                    and two children were there. It got everybody excited, not the least of whom was
                    I, but in the end there was no real problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, in '81 you're off again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I finally got caught and had to go to the States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say, it's about time!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I had come to the U.S. in 1980 for the advanced consular course that I
                    mentioned earlier. I'm not sure how it happened, but while here I ended up in
                    the office of Lou Geltz, who was at that time Deputy Assistant Secretary for
                    Overseas Citizen Services. Anyway, he referred me to Carmen DiPlacido, the chief
                    of one portion of what, I believe, was called then Citizens Consular Services.
                    As a consequence of these conversations, in the summer of 1981, I was
                    transferred to Washington to be head of the European division of Citizens
                    Consular Services, working under Carmen.</p>
                <p>Q: So you finally got assigned to the Department.</p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes. When I got up here to Washington, I sat on the promotion panels
                    for the first few weeks of my tour, then I went to work in the European division
                    of Overseas Citizen Services.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '81 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, less than a year, as it turns out. Anyway, I was in the Overseas
                    Citizens Services office for, I think, no more than forty-eight hours, when
                    President of Egypt Anwar Sadat was assassinated. All sorts of things were
                    happening that weren't going on three days before. This turned out to be quite
                    an opening to learn about the job. The assassination did not really affect me
                    personally in terms of what I was doing, but it was a big problem for the whole
                    office. So I learned quickly.</p>
                <p>Lou, as you know, had left Citizens Consular Services by the time I arrived.
                    There was no Deputy Assistant Secretary in the office for several months, but
                    ultimately, Lou was replaced by Bob Lane. Bob had been a vice consul in
                    Guadalajara when I was in Mazatl�n, so I knew him. In fact, I was actually the
                    only one around who knew him. He had come from being Deputy Chief of Mission in
                    Asuncion, Paraguay.</p>
                <p>This was my first experience in Washington. It was, as I say, in around October
                    of 1981. I enjoyed my stay and I learned a lot. Then in late March of the next
                    year, 1982, the argument, if you will, between Argentina and Britain, the...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Malvinas-Falklands.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Thank you so much. The Malvinas-Falklands War had started. I was
                    sitting at my desk in Citizens Consular Services when Bob Lane came and asked if
                    I had a minute. Well, of course I did, so he sat down and asked, “We need
                    somebody to go to Buenos Aires, on temporary duty right away. Can you go?”</p>
                <p>When he found out I had been stationed there for nearly four years he said,
                    “Well, you're the man then.” So, I left for Argentina pretty quickly thereafter.
                    The reasons were two-fold: the Malvinas-Falkland War coupled with the fact that
                    there were a number of personnel problems in the consular section. The fact that
                    I had previously been on assignment in Buenos Aires was an important aspect of
                    all of this. They thought my experience there would be useful, because it looked
                    like neither the boss nor his deputy would likely remain there very much
                    longer.</p>
                <p>I got to Buenos Aries on, I think, Monday night and spent ten weeks there,
                    although I was originally sent there for two weeks. You may remember that in the
                    lead-up to the beginning of the conflict, Secretary of State Alexander Haig
                    tried Kissinger-style shuttle diplomacy to try to patch the situation together.
                    He went back and forth from London to Buenos Aires on a number of occasions, but
                    later it was announced that the U.S. was going to back Britain in the war. There
                    was considerable worry that the Argentines would take their unhappiness with
                    that out on the U.S., and this was one of the things I was supposed to deal with
                    from a consular standpoint.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>I arrived a few days after the “we are going to back Britain” announcement came
                    out. Because of the potential for problems, which might include huge numbers of
                    Argentines coming into the embassy and tearing the place apart, the embassy
                    personnel had sent all of the consular (and, I assume, other) files, the
                    important files anyway, over to Montevideo. (Actually they didn't. It turns out
                    there was a lot of citizenship files that got stuck in the basement of the
                    embassy by mistake, but nobody knew they were there during my tenure.)</p>
                <p>So there were no visa files, there were ostensibly no citizenship files, and
                    worst of all, there were no American federal benefits, including Social
                    Security, files. The reason why I say “worst of all” is that those files had
                    been destroyed, I assume by mistake. Anyway, we had no Social Security files in
                    the office when I got there, and it was a long time before Social Security and
                    the other federal benefits organizations could provide reproductions of the
                    files they had on the American residents of Argentina on whom we had Federal
                    Benefits business.</p>
                <p>The reason I'm telling such a long build up to this story is that during the ten
                    weeks I was there, virtually all the American consular staff transferred to the
                    States or to other posts. Only one person remained of the entire consular
                    section about ten days after I arrived, a young vice consul at the time by the
                    name of Harry O'Hara. Also, I might add, because the Department saw these
                    transfers coming they sent a first tour vice consul, Alec Wilczinski, down from
                    Mexico City to help me out.</p>
                <p>However, during the ten weeks I was there, we had almost no work to do; virtually
                    none. Apart from the fact that we had no files, no Argentine nor virtually
                    anybody else wanted to be seen coming into the embassy after our having backed
                    Britain in the war. We had the occasional diplomatic visa, the occasional this,
                    the occasional that. We issued one immigrant visa for the spouse of an officer
                    of, I think, the Bank of Boston, but that was essentially it.</p>
                <p>The ten weeks I was in Buenos Aries were a lot of fun, frankly. Amazingly, the
                    second night I was there I went to a restaurant and ran into some friends whom
                    my wife and I had known ten years before. This was an Argentine friend (a man of
                    Basque origin who was born in the Philippines) and his American wife. We knew
                    them pretty well. To run into them within hours of my arrival in a city of
                    approximately ten million people was nothing short of amazing. So I had a good
                    time there, and having friends there helped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run across any anti-Americanism?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: Absolutely none. One afternoon early in my ten week “tour” in Buenos
                    Aires, I took a taxi somewhere. Now I speak Spanish, but nobody is ever going to
                    confuse me with a native speaker. Anyway, I told the taxi driver where I wanted
                    to go. He looked around at me and said, “You're a foreigner, aren't you?” I
                    admitted that I was an American. He promptly started to talk about the situation
                    in the country, starting with the chief of state, General Leopoldo Galtieri.
                    General Galtieri, he said, according to many people, started this war with
                    Britain to hide the fact that the economic situation was in serious decline once
                    again. The taxi driver went on and on in this vein, then repeated an old joke.
                    He said that all Argentines wish that the government would just build a four
                    lane highway between the president's palace, the Casa Rosada, and the army base
                    in town, so the generals could have their coups and their armies could go back
                    and forth while the rest of the Argentines could go about their business without
                    being bothered by these people. He was a very talkative taxi driver.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must've been there, over ten weeks, to see the fiasco
                        of when they put the Argentine army into the Malvinas and left them there.
                        That was disastrous.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: It was, indeed, a disaster.</p>
                <p>One of the interesting things about being in Buenos Aires during this time is
                    that somebody in the embassy put together a short wave radio so that everybody
                    could listen to the news. The best news we could get was from the British
                    Broadcasting Company out of London. With the exception of a few reporters out on
                    the British ships, virtually everybody on the BBC broadcasts was in fact located
                    a few blocks up the street from the embassy in the Sheraton Hotel. We would sit
                    there every night trying to understand what was happening, listening to these
                    scratchy short wave broadcasts from a quarter way around the world, yet most of
                    the people talking were just a few blocks up the street.</p>
                <p>After a couple of weeks, the British army landed at Goose Green on the main
                    island in the Falklands. There was a wonderful story that I heard on BBC. A
                    British officer had a two-shilling piece in his pocket. He found a payphone, put
                    the two shillings into the phone and called a relative or a friend in the
                    still-occupied Malvinas port town of Port Stanley to ask what was happening. The
                    person on the other end said, “Oh, the Argentines ran out of food, there's no
                    money, they are running out of supplies and really don't have anything. They're
                    in terrible shape. Just come on over.” I don't know whether this story is true,
                    but from what I could gather, it gives a flavor of the situation at the time.
                    Anyway, the British army stormed into Port Stanley and that was essentially the
                    end of the war.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>Rumor had it that the Argentine Head of State General Galtieri would have a drink
                    or two on occasion. One evening, he was supposed to give a major speech on that
                    Casa Rosada balcony where Per�n was seen speaking on many occasions. In fact, it
                    is the same balcony pictured in the movie Evita. The Hotel Continental, where I
                    was staying, was about three blocks from this plaza, so I walked down there at
                    the designated time to see the general give his speech. I hung around for a
                    couple of hours, but he never showed. The story was that he'd had a few drinks
                    and just couldn't come out and speak. Anyway, the idea that General Galtieri
                    started the war for the specific purpose of covering up a bad economic situation
                    rings true to me. I think a lot of Argentines believed that, too.</p>
                <p>The other part of this story is that during this ten-week period, I ate more
                    steak than I have ever eaten in my whole life. You probably know that the
                    world's finest beef, bar-none, is in Argentina. Once you're used to Argentine
                    steaks, nothing else is good enough.</p>
                <p>As Vice Consul Alec Wilczinski and I were a bit short of work to do, one day we
                    decided to lunch at a rather well-known restaurant near the main railroad
                    station called La Mosca Blanca. Incredibly, as Alec and I were crossing a main
                    thoroughfare heading toward the restaurant, the Pope (!) passed by, virtually
                    without any security people and certainly without much public around.</p>
                <p>Now we knew that the Pope was visiting Argentina at about this time, but we
                    hadn't focused on the matter. Apparently, for security reasons, the authorities
                    had changed his travel route without warning. As he passed by, he was standing
                    up in the Pope-mobile waving. Actually, there were only a few other people at
                    the intersection while he was passing by. We waved back, then went on and had
                    two of the largest steaks imaginable.</p>
                <p>The rest of the story focuses on the fact that only a few days after the Mosca
                    Blanca lunch, I got a call from Washington with the news that there was an
                    unexpected opening in Manila.</p>
                <p>I must say, I thought my boss, Carmen DiPlacido, accepted my precipitous
                    departure from his office, where I had been assigned for about six months, with
                    far too much alacrity. I was a little disappointed at how quickly he said,
                    “Sure, no problem,” or words to that effect. But off we went to Manila, some
                    eleven days after my return to Washington.</p>
                <p>I arranged to take my departure physical examination in Buenos Aires, not wait
                    until I got back to the States. Ansurprise, surprismy cholesterol level was out
                    of sight. Out of sight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From the steak?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Steak and red wine, I think.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>Anyway, my old friend, John St. Denis, came down and replaced me. He was with you
                    in...</p>
                <p>Q: In Korea.</p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, I met him there for the first time, actually, when I met you for
                    the first time during a conference.</p>
                <p>So off we went to Manila.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm surprised personnel let you get away with going away
                        to Manila, because they have this fifteen-year rule.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: The rule didn't actually apply to me until I became an FSO. I was a
                    staff officer during a good bit of the time I was overseas at the beginning of
                    my career.</p>
                <p>Anyway, by the time I returned to the U.S., Lisa had packed us up, so after
                    exactly eleven days back in the U.S., we left for Manila.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Basically we're talking about '81 still?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: No, I got back to the States from Guayaquil in the fall of 1981, went
                    to Argentina in late April of '82 and returned to the States after ten weeks. We
                    then left for Manila.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So '82 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: '85; I was three years in Manila as deputy consul general under Vernon
                    McAninch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interesting period of time. Could you talk
                        about the situation and talk about McAninch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Vernon McAninch, known far and wide as “Mac,” was extremely popular
                    and rightly so. I am a great fan of the late Mr. McAninch. He had his faults, as
                    we all do, but I will say from the very beginning that overall I thought the
                    world of him. During my later career in more senior positions, when something
                    came up and I wasn't sure what to do, I would try to stand back a little bit and
                    say to myself, “Now how would Mac have handled this?” And I could very often
                    come up with an answer trying somehow to use Mac's thinking.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>Mac was larger than life. He charmed almost everybody. My wife, as I have
                    mentioned, is Filipino. During our tour in the Philippines, my wife said
                    something that may tell you a little something about Mac. One evening, we were
                    at a rather large social gathering. Mac was there, too. After we came home that
                    evening, my wife looked out the window for a few seconds, then with a smile on
                    her face said, “You know, Mac must've been a Filipino in a former life. He knows
                    just how to get along with Filipinos.” Mac was very friendly, warm and
                    approachable.</p>
                <p>As you know, we had a big consular operation in Manila. One of the things Mac
                    taught me there, which I have religiously followed in the years since, was this.
                    He said, “Look, if you don't go out into the waiting room, once a week at a
                    minimum, and spend a little time to see what is going on, you're not doing your
                    job right.”</p>
                <p>As I understand the story, soon after he arrived in Manila, Mac went out and
                    spent some time in the visa waiting area. He discovered that there were some
                    guards selling visa applications. They were blanks only, but the guards were
                    making a little money on the side doing that.</p>
                <p>Well, I think Mac's dictum was good advice. To any consular officer who might
                    read this I say, take this advice: Get out there and see what's going on.</p>
                <p>Mac was a controversial figure. He was, as I said, larger than life, and I
                    learned a lot from him.</p>
                <p>If I were consular chief in Manila, I would have a long talk with newly arrived
                    officers, especially those who were new to the Service. I would emphasize the
                    various means many Filipinos use to obtain visas, either for themselves, or for
                    others, for financial or material gain. It is important that everyone
                    understands from the very beginning what goes on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was renowned for going into consular sections and
                        really changing everything around for the better. He was considered to be a
                        very good person for putting together an effective organization.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I think you're right and one of the reasons for that simply is this:
                    people wanted to do the right thing because he was the one who asked you to do
                    it, pure and simple. He had good ideas and good common sense. Let me give you an
                    example of that.</p>
                <p>Mac virtually always invited one or two, or more, junior officers to every
                    function he gave, and he gave a lot of functions. Now he didn't expect these
                    junior officers to serve drinks or something. Rather, they were just expected to
                    be there, meet the public, join the evening and see what went on. Mac regularly
                    tried to include junior officers in social gatherings, long before “best
                    practices” was the vogue.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ed, what about the pressure, which I understand is just
                        about worse than anywhere that one can be, on consular officers for
                        visas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: This is an important aspect, and I have sort of a unique view on this
                    because of my Filipino wife, Lisa. She was, I think, able to give me good
                    guidance and perhaps an Asian point of view on this subject, a point of view
                    that personally I otherwise wouldn't have had.</p>
                <p>The Philippines, certainly in the '60s when I first went there, but even today,
                    is a country where the vast majority of the population knows English pretty
                    well. We Americans have been associated with the Philippines in one way or
                    another for more than a hundred years, so Americans are well known and Filipinos
                    understand Americans very well.</p>
                <p>The number of Filipinos who would like very much to come to the U.S. and get a
                    job is quite high. It just seems like everybody wants to come here, many simply
                    to better their life, economically speaking. We have a huge consular section
                    there, and a lot of our people deal on a daily basis with non-immigrant visa
                    applications because of the large number of people who apply. Of course, we know
                    that there are many Filipinos who ought to have a visa, and we want to give
                    those people visas without delay. But we are obliged to sort through a huge
                    quantity of applicants every day to find those who do qualify. So it's a big,
                    difficult job for our officers there.</p>
                <p>All sorts of things are used to try to obtain visas. I'm talking about everything
                    from using illegal documents, to buttering up somebody at a restaurant or
                    wherever it may be when someone encounters a U.S. visa officer or anyone else
                    connected with the embassy.?</p>
                <p>It is a major problem and it is something that American officers need to
                    understand from the very beginning. The Filipino will try to see what can be
                    worked out. However, you should say something like, “No, I have moral standards
                    that do not allow me to discuss this now. Please understand I would like to be
                    your friend, but if you want a visa you should get an appointment for an
                    interview and apply.” Most Filipinos will understand that and basically that
                    will be that. You can make a case in a way that will turn it off, but if you
                    don't, it will never stop.</p>
                <p>It's difficult. Once you've given a favor to a friend (and I'm tempted to put the
                    word “friend” in quotes), that person will not be able to keep what has happened
                    quiet despite assurances otherwise. This is because: (1) that person will want
                    to show off that he or she is “well-connected” to a visa officer, hence he or
                    she has now attained some clout or social status, and/or (2) he or she will want
                    the word to get around so he or she can use this connection or “friendship” for
                    financial or material gain by asking special favors from this embassy
                    “friend.”</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>One incident that is relevant happened at Manila International Airport to my
                    wife. She accompanied her nephew, who was returning to New York's St. John's
                    University, right up to the immigration gate. A young immigration officer called
                    her nephew in and asked him to sit down at his desk. My wife went in with her
                    nephew and sat with him while the immigration officer asked him questions. The
                    conversation went like this, almost verbatim:</p>
                <p>Filipino Immigration officer: Why are you going to the States? Nephew: To study
                    at St. John's University. Officer: Who gave you your visa and how were you able
                    to get it? Nephew: Well, I just applied for it. Officer: Oh, I know So-and-So
                    (he gave the name of our one of our vice consuls) at the embassy. Do you know
                    him? Nephew: No, I don't know him. Officer: He's a very good friend of mine. Do
                    you know any consul at the embassy? Nephew: I know Mr. Wilkinson. Officer: Well,
                    I know Mr. So-and-So, and he is one of the high-ranking officers there. (Not
                    exactly true, as the named officer was a first-tour vice consul.)</p>
                <p>After a bit more of this, the Immigration officer let the nephew go. All the
                    while, my wife was very quiet and pretended not to understand what was
                    happening. She just said “thank you” when the “interview” was finished. She
                    returned back to the main terminal and her nephew went on into the departure
                    lounge.</p>
                <p>So what was the purpose of selecting a 19-year-old student for such an interview?
                    My wife suggests that the whole idea was for the Immigration officer to make as
                    clear as he could to the aunt of the young student that hthe Immigration
                    officewas available in case the aunt needed a U.S. visa. Or perhaps he was just
                    trying to boost his “social standing” by proclaiming that he was well plugged
                    into the U.S. Embassy.</p>
                <p>Whatever it was, it was anything but innocuous.</p>
                <p>I have many Filipino friends, and I think the world of the country and the
                    people. But what I've described is a fact of life, and consular officers,
                    certainly visa officers, need to understand that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've never served or been to the Philippines. On hearing
                        the stories when I went to Seoul, which was really taking off as a place for
                        immigrant and non-immigrant visas about the time I got there in 1976 or so,
                        one of my major concerns was of consular officers getting caught in two
                        ways. One was sex; usually young ladies were thrown at the officers, and the
                        other...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Or they threw themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or the other one was getting favors; special deals on
                        people going out and buying antiques. I remember having a deputy who left
                        shortly after I got there, but had an in with all sorts of firms that all
                        sold things and all this. We never caught anything, but it made me very
                        nervous. Luckily, I was married and I don't like to buy things, but these
                        were the two things and nothing ever turned up. It was a concern. It must've
                        been a real concern for you because everything was multiplied by a certain
                        number.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: As I mentioned before, what you have described is something more
                    difficult to deal with in Manila because of the fact that so many people in the
                    Philippines speak and understand English so well, which means that a lot more
                    people can get to you more easily. I don't mean to imply that the Philippines is
                    the only place where this goes on, however.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, no. It's just that the problem was compounded there.
                        Hong Kong has always been a problem. How did you deal with this? We're
                        talking about young officers coming in, for the most part relatively naive
                        because it's not the sort of thing you got exposed to in the United
                        States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, that's all true. On the other hand, there were some senior
                    officers who got themselves into some pickles as well. But, you're right. A
                    junior officer is probably the most vulnerable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The senior officers; that's their problem, but as a
                        supervisor, you're problem is the junior officers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: The first thing you need to do is to have the kind of conversation
                    that you and I are having. For example, a senior officer should sit down
                    one-on-one or something pretty close to that, describe this situation, then say,
                    “Look, we are watching this closely because this is a serious issue.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself playing the role of elderly
                        psychiatrist, counsel, all that, with your officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I tried to, and I think my best guide in this regard was my wife. She
                    made it very clear from the very beginning to everybody from her sisters and
                    brother to her friends and acquaintances and everybody else, that once you give
                    one person a “favor,” you open yourself up to many, many more such requests. She
                    never allowed this to happen in Manila or anywhere else, hence no one bothered
                    her, at least not after a first try.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any officer problems while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: In this regard? Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were those found out and how were they handled?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I don't believe while I was there that there was anybody who was
                    booted out. The problems were less serious. But sometimes you had to call people
                    on the carpet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the criticisms I heard about McAninch, you heard
                        these things because he was bigger than life, in a way, was at a time when
                        things were getting a little shaky in the administration of President
                        Marcos. You were there when Aquino was killed, weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, we were assigned to Manila, but in fact my wife and I were in
                    the States when Ninoy Aquino was assassinated. I think it was around September
                    of 1983.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was the charge, it's not a real charge, but I mean
                        the saying that the embassy, many of the senior officers were too damn close
                        to the Marcos'; they were throwing parties and all this and McAninch name
                        came up in some of this, being the party giver and all of this. Was this a
                        problem or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes. I'm sorry to say that it was. Mac was very close to several
                    senior government people. There was a video that was spread all over the world
                    of Vernon McAninch and Imelda Marcos, the president's wife, dancing at
                    Malacanang Palce. The picture hit the airwaves around the time the Marcoses left
                    the Philippines rather in a hurry. Of course, being close with high government
                    officials is just fine, in a certain sense. One of your jobs as an embassy
                    officer, at least among senior officers, is to get as close as you can to
                    important people. But I think Mac got far too close.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came back after the time in the States, was there
                        sort of the word, “Let's draw back a bit from our relationship to the
                        government and power,” i.e. the Marcos government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, I guess I would have to answer that question by saying, we in
                    the consular section were pretty far from other than consular thinking at the
                    time. I can't believe that the answer to that is other than, “Yes, that's
                    exactly what happened,” but I can't honestly say that I remember that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with police officials and people
                        who issued passports, in other words, government officials with whom you'd
                        be dealing as the consular officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Some were very, very nice and reasonable and helpful and there were
                    others who were largely on the take. At one point, there was a foreign minister
                    whose brother, a disbarred judge, set up shop out in the Foreign Ministry's
                    passport office to organize a little help if you needed it. I would say that was
                    pretty egregious, but over all this sort of thing was not too unusual.</p>
                <p>Policemen, like far too many places in Latin America, for example, don't make
                    very much money. So they have to figure out a way that supplements their income.
                    I'm sorry to say that that was standard business there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were visa brokers a major problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, of course. One variation on this problem was this: everybody, it
                    would seem, was absolutely convinced that it was impossible to get a U.S.
                    tourist visa without some sort of help. Therefore, many people who didn't need
                    any particular push went to visa brokers. So, for example, visa officers would
                    accept an application for a visa from a man or a woman who made $1000 a week (I
                    am making up some numbers here). But fearing that they would not be able to get
                    a visa, they would go to a visa broker and get “proof” that they made $3000 a
                    week. Now, they've lied to you. Such a lie would not be “material,” perhaps, but
                    the whole thing seriously complicated the visa processing. Unfortunately,
                    variations on this theme were the kind of things that were going on all the
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ed, you're leaving Manila and what year are you
                        leaving?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: We were in Manila from '82 to '85. We left in the summer of 1985.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went back to Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: We came to Washington, actually, for my one and only complete tour
                    here. I had been contacted by my personnel officer, Dick McCoy (whom I replaced
                    in Costa Rica years before), who thought, that with the personalities involved,
                    I would fit neatly into the particular job he had in mind. I accepted his view
                    and was assigned to the Bureau of Human Rights where I was to deal with asylum
                    claims. Let me explain a little bit about that the job.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>Asylum issues are dealt with strictly and solely by the Attorney General or his
                    designee, according to the pertinent law, the Immigration and Nationality Act.
                    This makes sense because a person may only claim asylum if he or she is within
                    the United States or are at a U.S. port of entry. The Attorney General had
                    devolved the responsibility for dealing with asylum claims on to the Immigration
                    and Naturalization Service.</p>
                <p>Until the passage of the Refugee Act of 1980, there was nothing in U.S. law that
                    talked about asylum or refugee issues. The Refugee Act of 1980 came about, I
                    would think it's fair to say, largely as a consequence of the revolution that
                    took place in Iran in 1979. Soon thereafter, a large number of Iranians and came
                    to the U.S. wanting to stay here. The law was passed, by the way, about the time
                    of the beginning of the Mariel boatlift. Until the passage of the act, the
                    Attorney General had to deal with what amounted to asylum claimeven though such
                    claims were not mentioned in U.S. immigration laby a part of the Immigration and
                    Nationality Act that was written for something quite different, section
                    212(d)(3)(a). This section of the law really allows an immigration officer at a
                    port of entry to let somebody in, if the officer believes that everything else
                    required by the law has been satisfied. For example, if an alien arrives at the
                    port of entry with valid visa in a passport that is expired, or something else
                    that is wrong, but that looks quite innocuous, the immigration officer can
                    invoke section 212(d)(3)(a) and say, “Okay, we'll make an exception in your
                    case. Come on in. You can stay three months (or whatever it might be).”</p>
                <p>For example, after the revolution in Hungary in 1956, there were large numbers of
                    people who came to the U.S., doubtless with the intent to stay. The immigration
                    people would invoke section 212(d)(3)(a) of the Immigration and Nationality Act
                    to allow these people to stay in the United States. There really was nowhere
                    else for many of them to go, but this was not why that portion of the law was
                    written, i.e., for large numbers of people to enter at one particular time. But
                    the Attorney General used it anyway in such cases because there was no other
                    reasonable way to deal with these people.</p>
                <p>So the Refugee Act was passed, and then for the first time U.S. law had a way of
                    dealing with refugees and asylum claims.</p>
                <p>The Refugee Act of 1980 was essentially an amendment to the Immigration and
                    Nationality Act of 1952. One of the things that was included in the new law was
                    a definition of a refugee. If you read the definition of a refugee in the
                    Refugee Act, and look at it side by side with the definition the United Nations
                    has of a refugee, you'll see that the two are pretty much the same. Therefore,
                    our law has great similarity with the laws of many, many nations because most
                    nations used either the U.N. definition of a refugee or something very close to
                    it.</p>

                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: I was extremely fortunate in that in December of 1987 I was promoted
                    into the Senior Foreign Service. I applied for a number of jobs abroad that I
                    thought would be perfect, none of which I got. Then, because of a number of
                    unrelated occurrences, including a retirement or two that were not expected (at
                    least by Personnel), all of a sudden the consul general job in Seoul, Korea,
                    opened up. Out of the blue, I got an inquiry basically from the front office of
                    the Bureau of Consular Affairs. Would I be interested in Seoul? Now the position
                    wasn't actually offered to me at that time. The caller simply said, “Did you
                    notice that the Seoul job is open? It might be something you would like to
                    pursue.” I said, “it sounds like a wonderful job,” and so I bid on it
                    immediately and was fortunate enough to get it.</p>

                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: We got there in late fall of 1988, and we stayed until the summer of
                    1992; we were there four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the reader of this, I had that job from '76 to '79,
                        but I want you to explain things, because you're not explaining to me, but
                        you're explaining to them. How would you describe American-Korean relations
                        when you got there in '88?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: It's important to remember the dates, because the political situation
                    had changed a great deal since you were there. Don't forget that in 1979
                    President Park Chung Hee was assassinated, causing a great deal of tension. I
                    think by any standard, from the end of the Korean War until sometime in the '85
                    to '88 timeframe, depending on your definitions here, Korea was a dictatorship.
                    This is a country that was and, of course, still is, our ally. We had excellent
                    reasons to be on their side, but a dictatorship is not really the Americans'
                    idea of a wonderful country, at least in most cases. But as a consequence of the
                    political situation in the country, conditions developed into a military
                    confrontation with unhappy citizens in, I think, the year 1980, when there was
                    an uprising against the Korean dictatorship. Unfortunately, in that case a large
                    number of Koreans were shot down by their own countrymen, the military.</p>
                <p>A few years after that incident, the general who was in charge in the field where
                    the shootings took place, Roh Tae Woo, was “named” the next president by the
                    president of Korea at the time, Chun Doo Hwan (himself, of course, a
                    general).</p>
                <p>Chun simply announced one day that Roh would be his successor.</p>
                <p>As I understand the story, as a consequence of this announcement, virtually
                    within hours the city was filled with demonstrations against this situation. The
                    Korean citizenry had had enough; they wanted a democracy. Apparently, the famous
                    and beautiful, Namdaemoon area was absolutely filled with protesters, as far as
                    the eye could see.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: South Gate, it was called.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Right, South Gate. Huge numbers of people demonstrated rather, I think
                    it's fair to say, unexpectedly, so President Chun quickly backed off from this
                    statement that General Roh would be the next president.</p>
                <p>In the event, they actually had a fairly democratic election. Unfortunately, for
                    the people who really wanted to sidetrack the military in the Republic of Korea,
                    two long-time dissidents ran against each other, as well as against Roh Tae Woo.
                    Essentially, the votes for the two dissidents canceled each other out, so
                    General Roh became president anyway. This took place not long before we arrived
                    in Korea.</p>
                <p>So after Roh's election, steps were taken to allow a loosening of the bounds that
                    the Korean government had imposed on the people. One of the things that was done
                    was to allow people who wanted to travel abroad to simply apply for a passport.
                    Before that, one could not leave the country without the government's okay. This
                    was not your choice; this was the government's choice. The idea, as I understood
                    it, was that Korea, as a consequence of the Korean War, was so devastated that
                    they could not afford to have the man in the street go abroad and spend money.
                    That money was needed it in Korea, so people were not allowed to travel abroad
                    unless the government said it was okay.</p>
                <p>The Government of Korea gradually eliminated this requirement, so when we arrived
                    there in 1988, I think the rule was that people over fifty years old could, if
                    they chose, go and get a passport and travel abroad. The idea was that, little
                    by little, the age would be lowered so that ultimately all Koreans would be able
                    to depart. And this was done.</p>
                <p>There were lots of other laws and rules that were being changed in this way.
                    These were President Roh's and his people's initiatives. These changes in Korea
                    made a huge difference to us in our consular operation and our immigration
                    colleagues also felt the same thing. Consular operations increased very, very
                    quickly.</p>
                <p>When we got to Korea in 1988, these changes were well in train, but by no means
                    was it finished. It was during our period of time there, the four years we were
                    there, that these travel restrictions were loosened, so that people could leave
                    if they wanted to. Therefore we received huge numbers of non-immigrant visa
                    applications, which, of course, made a big difference in our workload. Our
                    immigration officer friends had a similar experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Some numbers: When we arrived in Korea, our immigration visa workload was large.
                    Great numbers of Koreans did want to leave Korea during the period after the
                    Korean War up until around 1987 or so. They wanted to do so for political and
                    for economic reasons. Simply put, they wanted to go for political reasonbecause
                    of the fact that the country was a dictatorshiand for economic reasons, because
                    it was difficult for the average person to live well in Korea. So people left.
                    But because conditions changed rather rapidly, both economically and
                    politically, during this period leading up to when we got there as well as after
                    we arrived. People began to come back to Korea. Koreans who had been living
                    abroad began to come back.</p>
                <p>The first year we were there, 1988, we looked at, I believe, something like
                    27,000 or 28,000 immigrant visa applications and 78,000 or 79,000 non-immigrant
                    visa applications. Four years later, the year I left, the numbers were quite
                    different. We, I think, looked at some 17,000 immigrant visa applications and
                    256,000 non-immigrant visa applications!</p>
                <p>Large numbers of people wanted to go abroad for tourism and study. The government
                    was not concerned about them going abroad because, by and large, they came back.
                    Now there are exceptions to that, needless to say, but it was simply not the
                    same as it was during your experience there, Stu, because many, many Koreans who
                    were living abroad wanted to come home. Korea was where they wanted to live
                    their lives.</p>
                <p>During my four years in Korea (or at least during the latter part of my tour),
                    the U.S. Immigration Service accepted back more “green cards” than any other
                    office. In other words, Koreans who had been immigrants in the United States
                    returned home to Korea. They came to the Immigration Service offices at the
                    embassy to say, “Fine, thank you. I enjoyed it but I don't want to live in the
                    U.S. anymore.” They had to do that in order to get certain documentation needed
                    to live and work in Korea. It did fall off. It never went away, of course.
                    There's always a certain number of people who, for one reason or another, want
                    to get out, want to go away, and couldn't qualify for a visa. These are
                    essentially poor people, and this of course goes on in virtually every country
                    in the world. But I am sure that statistically speaking the numbers of fraud
                    cases fell off a great deal.</p>
                <p>There was a thing that happened, I think in 1982, which is something that I'd
                    like to tell, if I may. It's jusfrankla short visa fraud story. It was wonderful
                    in its simplicity and I'm just still in awe. I wish that I could say I would
                    have somehow figured out what was going on if I had been there, but I doubt I
                    would have.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>Specifically, what was happening is this: if you are a U.S. citizen or a resident
                    alien and you want your close relative to come and join you in the States, there
                    is a procedure for this. One files a form I-130 with the Immigration and
                    Naturalization Service. That form, essentially, puts together your status,
                    resident or citizen, and your relationship to this person whom you wish to
                    sponsor. If, for example, you were married and you wanted to sponsor your
                    spouse, then you'd bring to the Immigration Service office proof of your U.S.
                    citizenship or your permanent residence status information, together with your
                    marriage certificate. Or, if you wish to sponsor a parent or a child, then you'd
                    bring the birth certificate verifying the relationship. So, it's all tied
                    together and this completed I-130 form, duly approved by the immigration officer
                    and specifically or at least theoretically, signed off on by the District
                    Director of the office where it is filed is sent to the U.S. consular section in
                    the place where the person is living. Based on this approved form, the immigrant
                    visa application will be processed in due course.</p>
                <p>The fraud that was being perpetrated on us was this. One or more of our locally
                    engaged staff would go to the supply room and get packets of blank forms I-130s,
                    which we had because people could also file this form in the immigration office
                    in Seoul. Then they would take the blank ones home or somewhere and fill them in
                    with plausible information. They made them look like the real things, including
                    the “official” stamp that ostensibly attested to the “fact” that the application
                    had been properly approved. Then, I am tolI wasn't there at the timthe persons
                    perpetrating this fraud simply tossed the completed forms into the mailroom in a
                    way that made them look like they arrived from the U.S.</p>
                <p>Our staff theprobably not people in on the deatook them mixed up with legitimate
                    ones and filled in the appropriate visa processing forms and the cards then
                    filed them away to await further processing. In some cases, the people who were
                    beneficiaries of these fraudulent papers had to wait for a period of time
                    because there's only a certain number that can be processed in a year's time.
                    But they did that and lots of people got visas under these circumstances.</p>
                <p>Now, as I say, the reason I am in sort of awe of all this was the simplicity of
                    it. It didn't require very mucbasically some knowledge of the procedures and a
                    typewriter. So there you are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm told this was picked up by a visa officer who noticed
                        that the typing thing always seemed to be on the same typewriter.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, I heard that, too. It's my understanding that a series of things
                    came together to finally put a stop to the scam. I don't know all the details
                    here. I have heard conflicting stories. But, as you say, one of the things was
                    that somebody began to notice that it didn't matter if the completed form I-130
                    came from Portland, Oregon, or St. Louis, or Miami, they always looked like they
                    had been completed with the same typewriter. I would not be surprised to find
                    that some of our Korean staff might have been involved with reporting this as
                    well, because virtually all of them were persons who wanted to do the right
                    thing.</p>
                <p>Another part of the story was, when they finally picked up on this fraud,
                    somebody decided that it would be a good idea to keep files of all issued
                    immigrant visas. The rules were that we shred old immigrant visa files afteI
                    forgesix months or a year. In any event, it was decided in 1982, after the fraud
                    was discovered, that we would simply keep all immigrant visa files. As far as I
                    could figure, nobody thought about this decision again.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we arrived in the fall of 1988. Sometime the next year I found out that
                    as a consequence of this 1982 decision there was an entire warehouse full of
                    paper. There was no filing system whatsoever, so it was hard to find anything.
                    The mountains of forms and documents were essentially useless.</p>
                <p>It was a major problem to figure out a legal, acceptable way to get rid of all
                    this paper. Now as you know, for reasons of privacy, pertaining to the U.S.
                    citizens and resident aliens who had filed many of the applications, you can't
                    just put all this paper out for trash pickup. It's got to be destroyed. We spent
                    a great deal of time and effort destroying this six-year build-up of paper. We
                    finally got rid of it, but that was a huge job all by itself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of privacy and files, one of the problems that
                        concerned me when I was there, was the possibility of war with North Korea.
                        I mean, North Korea was about thirty-five miles away and in 1950, the North
                        Koreans came and captured our embassy with a lot of papers intact and we had
                        these files about people who were attached to the United States which could
                        go very ill on the assumption that the North Koreans might take over the
                        embassy. We never came up with a real solution for it. Was this sort of
                        beyond the consideration about North Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: There was an awful lot of time and effort spent thinking about North
                    Korea and its impact on the south and various possibilities, but the possible
                    destruction of consular files is not one that I ever heard of.</p>
                <p>Q: How about student visas? When I was there, it was almost all graduate students
                    and many male and they'd had to finish military service before they'd get their
                    passport.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: From, I believe, well before you arrived in Korea until around 1988 or
                    even a bit later, the number of student visa applications was relatively small.
                    This is because, as I mentioned earlier, before virtually any Korean male could
                    get a passport, he had to finish his military service. There were other
                    restrictions and limitations. As far as I know, it was virtually impossible to
                    get permission to leave the country to do undergraduate work, and graduate work
                    was not something you could just do because you wanted to. You had to have
                    government okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Women could go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: There were fewer restrictions on women, I think, but restrictions
                    existed. Again, this sort of thing eased off basically in the short period just
                    after our arrival in Seoul.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also the quality of schools these people were going to was
                        really very high. When I was there they were going to good schools; very
                        solid things, unlike when I was in Saudi Arabia and in some other places
                        where people were going to? not what I would call real educational
                        institutions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, to repeat, the Korean Government had a say about whether you
                    could go and where you could go. I wouldn't be surprised to find that the
                    Government simply would approve permission to study abroad only for very good
                    schools. The idea was that these students would come back and put what they had
                    learned to very good use. If a student wanted to go to a diploma mill, they
                    probably wanted to use the opportunity to cut and run.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, or the institutions in the United States were claiming they were going to
                    give them a good education when they really weren't.</p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I agree with that although, as I said, certainly toward the end of my
                    experience in Korea, people could just simply choose to go anif we could see
                    that they could afford to do what they proposed to dwe didn't get into the
                    question of whether they wanted to study at the ABC College or Harvard. There
                    were huge changes during that four-year period that were, I would have to say,
                    largely thanks to changes that took place during the term of President Roh Tae
                    Woo.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about GI marriages and all this? There has always
                        been a problem anywhere we are where we have military because they usually
                        end up going out with women who are prostitutes, or who often do that and
                        have liaisons and there used to be anyway a real network of organizations in
                        the United States, sort of, I think, Korean run, of getting young and
                        not-so-young women to come over as so-called brides and then they would
                        immediately be off on a range. They'd leave their husband and go off and
                        work for massage parlors.</hi>

                <p>WILKINSON: Well, all of that was going on and, I suspect, still goes on, like in
                    many other countries. Back to Taiwan a moment, my friend, Consul Lynn Curtain,
                    told me of interviewing a lady in Taipei for an immigrant visa. She, when asked,
                    could not remember the name of her husband, the man who ostensibly had filed the
                    I-130 petition on her behalf. That was unfortunately the sort of thing that you
                    dealt with all too often. Of course, there were na�ve people, too. It was a
                    mixed bag and the role of our consular officers is, among other things, to
                    decide what is reasonable and what is not. But what you describe certainly
                    existed. It probably still does.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about American citizens in jail or in trouble? Did you
                        have problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: No, we didn't have problems. We had a number of Americans in jail, of
                    course. The Koreans were relatively cooperative with us in trying to make life
                    as acceptable as possible, within limits, for Americans in jail there. I don't
                    think our American Citizens Services officers who dealt with these problems felt
                    that they had serious problems in this regard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the American business community? Did you have
                        much connection with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, yes. I might mention something here with regards to that. I
                    worked closely with the Korean-American Chamber of Commerce there on a variety
                    of issues, one of which was providing a special sort of nonimmigrant visa
                    procedure for people in which the Chamber was interested.</p>
                <p>It began like this: Soon after I got to Seoul, I went to an American Chamber
                    luncheon. By chance, I sat next to the Boeing representative in Korea who
                    explained he was having trouble getting visas for some people from Korean
                    Airlines who were going to go to Seattle to buy some airplanes. I told him,
                    “Well, it seems to me that if somebody is going to go to the U.S. to buy a
                    billion dollars worth of airplanes, or whatever, we ought to be falling all over
                    ourselves to get their paperwork in order.”</p>
                <p>So, I worked closely with the AmCham there to try to ensure expeditious
                    processing for appropriate non-immigrant visa applications. Not that we issued
                    visas at their say so, but rather we made it as easy as we possibly could for
                    those people who were of interest to the U.S. of A. to make the visa application
                    processing as convenient as we could. This is because if they were of interest
                    to American members of the Chamber, we felt it was in our collective government
                    interest to be as helpful and cooperative as we could be. We got a lot of pats
                    on the back for this, I'm pleased to say.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>In this regard, I worked closely with the Department of Commerce Trade Center
                    representative there at the time, Bill Yarmy. Bill started the Visit U.S.A.
                    group in Korea with people from the travel business, to encourage tourism to the
                    U.S.</p>
                <p>But there wasn't a huge amount of business that Koreans had with the U.S. at that
                    time. I think my Boeing example was an exception.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find life in Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I loved it for a variety of reasons. After the Korean War, Korea was,
                    of course, devastated. The United States Agency for International Development,
                    USAID, came to Korea and, as you know, built some housing for their people on
                    the U.S. Yongsan military base located in Seoul. As I understand it, Yongsan was
                    a property where the Japanese had a base during their occupation of Korea. The
                    Koreans wanted no part of the locale simply because of the bad memories of the
                    Japanese. So this became a major U.S. military base, largely because it was
                    available. Right after the Korean War, it was on the outskirts of Seoul. After
                    USAID ceased working in Korea, we embassy people acquired the housing. As the
                    embassy grew, we built and acquired some other buildings and property.</p>
                <p>Lisa and I lived out on the Yongsan base. There were some other properties down
                    closer to the embassy where people lived, too. Again, they were
                    Japanese-occupation related. One was a banking community?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I lived in Compound Two, which I think was
                        banking.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, that's right. Compound One was another one.</p>
                <p>Q: The Ambassador and the Deputy Chief of Mission and some other senior officers
                    lived there.</p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, it cost Uncle Sam relatively little money to house embassy
                    officers during the time we were there. Yongsan and the other locations were
                    clean and safe. We had some friends from other embassies and knew other
                    foreigners who lived in Seoul, and they did suffer some robberies and some other
                    problems in living in Seoul proper. We, frankly, didn't have to put up with such
                    problems, so that was very nice.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>On my way to Korea in 1988, I stopped in Portland, Oregon, and saw a retired
                    Foreign Service friend, Russ Winge. He introduced me to the head of the Korean
                    community in that city. I think he was the president of the Korean Association
                    there. Anyway, he invited Russ and me to lunch. We had a nice repast at a Korean
                    restaurant and that was my first real experience with Korean food.</p>
                <p>We got to Korea soon thereafter, and within days I got a call from for a Korean
                    Foreign Service officer who was, at the time, in charge of the passport office.
                    He was a classmate of the Korean Association man from Portland. The passport
                    officer invited me to lunch at a restaurant about a fifteen-minute walk from the
                    embassy.</p>
                <p>We had an all-Korean lunch, seated on the floor and eating from a low table in
                    Korean style. During the lunch, I noticed that there were plates around the
                    passport officer that were not around me. I asked, “What are those things over
                    there?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Oh, you wouldn't like this.” So I learned fairly quickly, that Koreans,
                    by and large (and I'll just say this without any apology), firmly believe that
                    we foreigners do not, in general, like their food. Naturally, I insisted on
                    having some plates just like he had. Even if I didn't like what was being
                    served, I was going to eat it because I didn't want people to make those
                    assumptions. Well, I have to admit, some of them were a bit of a shock; Koreans
                    like spicy food. But over the four years there, I learned to love Korean
                    food.</p>
                <p>Even today, my wife and I, under virtually every circumstance when we think about
                    going out to eat here in the Washington area almost always think first of going
                    to a Korean restaurant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were there until 1992?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes. During the late fall of 1991, I had my eye on what I thought
                    would be the perfect job for me, the Refugee Coordinator in Bangkok, Thailand.
                    By chance, I noticed that my former boss when I was in the Asylum Office,
                    Ambassador Richard Schifter, Assistant Secretary of the Bureau of Human Rights
                    and Humanitarian Affairs, was going to stop by Korea on his way to China. I sent
                    a message to Ambassador Schifter to ask that he give me a few minutes during his
                    stopover. He was gracious enough to allow me to come and breakfast with him at
                    his hotel. Essentially, I explained a bit about the job I was seeking and asked
                    him to put in a good word for me at the Bureau of Refugee Affairs.</p>
                <p>I'm not sure what he did. He may have made a phone call, he may have sent a note,
                    he may have ignored mI doubt that somehobut in any event I got the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Bangkok from '92 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: Until 1995. We were there for a three-year assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about what you were doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Being Refugee Coordinator was a two-part job. The officer dealt, on
                    the one hand, with what the U.S. Government was doing to help Cambodian, Lao and
                    Vietnamese refugees in the refugee camps in Thailand. There were a number of
                    refugee camps all along the Thai/Lao and the Thai/Cambodia borders. These were
                    places where people who had left Vietnam and Laos during and after the Vietnam
                    War, and later the Cambodian atrocities perpetrated by Pol Pot, were housed. We
                    had, in the Refugee Bureau, funding available for food and for a variety of
                    other services. In addition, our immigration colleagues went to these camps and
                    interviewed people who had applied for refugee status to go to the U.S.
                    Immigration officers did this in a manner roughly parallel to reviewing an
                    asylum claim within the United States. This is because a person abroad applies
                    for refugee status, while a person inside the U.S. or at a port of entry applies
                    for asylum status. My part of this job had to do with providing appropriate
                    funding for food, shelter and so on.</p>
                <p>The other part of the job was overseeing the Orderly Departure Program, or ODP.
                    ODP was effectively an immigration processing operation within Vietnam. A few
                    years before my arrival in Bangkok, the Vietnamese finally agreed that we
                    Americans could go to Vietnam and process applications for people who wished to
                    apply for immigration visas or, in some cases, refugee status within Vietnam.
                    Now that, it seems to me, was an amazing thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is. A country, at that time, we did not have diplomatic
                        relations with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: We had no diplomatic relations with Vietnam at the time, yet there we
                    were, together with our U.S. immigration colleagues, processing visa and refugee
                    applications within the country of Vietnam. Our officers were consular
                    personnel, like any other, looking at immigrant visa applications and
                    immigration officers looking at refugee applications. They traveled to Vietnam
                    in teams. All this had been arranged before I arrived in Bangkok.</p>
                <p>The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry dealt with these matters. We, in fact, did our
                    processing in the old Foreign Ministry building in Ho Chi Minh City, which I
                    might say, virtually everybody, except officials in the government in Vietnam,
                    calleand still calSaigon. This building was the Foreign Ministry up until 1975.
                    It was near the presidential palace, the main cathedral, not at all far from the
                    National Assembly, the Continental Palace Hotel, and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know it well.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: I had been to Saigon a couple of times during my courier days, and it
                    was very interesting to go back and see it.</p>
                <p>The teams would fly into Tan Son Nhut Airport and generally spend two weeks in
                    Saigon. As I indicated, all of this was organized through the Vietnamese Foreign
                    Ministry. There was a team of people within the Foreign Ministry who worked with
                    the non-governmental organization, the NGO, who helped us with the processing. I
                    might add we worked very closely with non-governmental organizations in Bangkok
                    and in Vietnam both in the ODP processing in Vietnam and in providing the
                    refugee services in Thailand.</p>
                <p>When I first went to Hanoi in the fall of 1992 in my role as supervisor of the
                    Orderly Departure Program, the only American office that existed there was the
                    POW-MIA operation. They were, of course, coordinating the search for remains of
                    U.S. military personnel lost during the Vietnam War. They were very helpful to
                    us and, in fact, when the State Department first sent three middle-grade
                    officers to essentially be resident in Hanoi prior to recognition, they first
                    set up shop, so to speak, in the building the POW-MIA people occupied.</p>
                <p>We had a good working relationship with the Foreign Ministry officials. We also
                    dealt with the Ministry of Interior. The Interior people, like Ministry of
                    Interior people anywhere, were a little tougher to deal with, but by and large,
                    we were well received by all.</p>
                <p>Once again, I'll have to admit that one of the reasons why I liked that job was
                    the wonderful opportunity to get to know Vietnamese of all stripes during my
                    time there.</p>
                <p>Later during my tour, an office was opened in Hanoi, the precursor to the
                    embassy. When that office opened, our lives became a little bit easier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you, in a sense, employ Foreign Service Nationals
                        under some other guy's name or something, who were working for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes we did. Actually, what happened is that we had a contract with a
                    non-governmental organization that employed a number of clerical staff and
                    interpreters. These people were, as a practical matter, our FSNs, our Foreign
                    Service Nationals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about working with the Vietnamese officials of the
                        Ministry of Foreign Affairs? Was it a fairly relaxed office?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, it was fairly relaxeat least the people we dealt with. There was
                    a young man, an interpreter, who I believe was on contract to the Foreign
                    Ministry. He had been in the U.S. as a high school student in an exchange
                    program and his English was very good. Although plenty of people at the Foreign
                    Ministry and elsewhere spoke English and we had our own interpreters, the man
                    from the Foreign Ministry who was in charge of our program did not speak
                    English, so hand wdepended very much on his interpreter. Of course, our Foreign
                    Service ODP officers were pretty fluent in Vietnamese, as well.</p>
                <p>The Vietnamese people with whom we workeMinistry people, our “FSNs”, etc. would
                    very often invite us to dine at a restaurant or we would invite them to lunch or
                    dinner. I think our easy relationship might have been something that was very
                    helpful in the opening of relations in that country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now let's talk about the people you would see in Vietnam
                        to be orderly departed. Who were they and what were their stories?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Our consular ODP officers interview those individuals who might
                    qualify for an immigrant visa, such as the spouse of an American citizen, the
                    spouse of a resident alien or the mother and father or child of an American
                    citizen in the U.S. If you fit a category of people who could get an immigrant
                    visa, and you could get a passport (generally not a problem), we would issue the
                    visa in the very same way as we did in Bangkok or Tokyo or anywhere else.</p>
                <p>We also accepted applications for immigration from “Amerasians,” of course. These
                    were offspring of GIs and Vietnamese women during the time of the war. These
                    children were not at all accepted in the close-knit Vietnamese society, so a
                    special law was passed in the U.S. to give these kids special treatment. Of
                    course, by the time I got there, they weren't “kids” anymore.</p>
                <p>And, as I indicated before, our U.S. Immigration colleagues interviewed
                    individuals who might qualify for refugee status. Essentially, these were the
                    same people who, if they had gotten out of Vietnam, might have qualified for
                    refugee status in Thailand or in one of the other refugee camps. Or, they were
                    relatives of some of these people. Effectively, the Orderly Departure Program
                    was a combined visa and refugee operation.</p>
                <p>There was also a special program for so-called Montagnards, an ethnic group of
                    people akin to the Hmong in Laos. They could fairly easily make a case that they
                    were being discriminated against within Vietnam.</p>
                <p>So this processing was parallel to things going on in other parts of the world.
                    However, I think that the incredible difference was that we were doing these
                    programs in a country with which, nearly twenty years before, we'd been at
                    war.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think in a way we still were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I think it would be awkward for somebody to come and say, “You know, I'm being
                    discriminated against by this government when you have a government interpreter
                    taking this down. I mean, how does that work?</p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, technically they weren't government interpreters, although I
                    have no doubt that they had to report. But people did make these claims, and I'm
                    not aware of endemic problems related to this.</p>
                <p>I might add here that we also worked very closely with officials from the United
                    Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) in Saigon. They and other
                    international organizations put a lot of pressure on the Vietnamese to say,
                    “Come on, let's be reasonable here. These are, in many cases, old folks who
                    aren't going to do you any harm. Let's help everybody out here.” And so, there
                    was a great deal of help given to us by the UNHCR in this regard as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Caucasian Americans; were they coming back to
                        visit at all at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, they were beginning to come back, some to help the country, some
                    to just be tourists. And I met at least one Vietnamese refugee who came back and
                    established a number of factories to make prosthetic devices rather
                    inexpensively, partly from old rubber tires. In fact, that gentleman lives here
                    in the Washington area and owns a number of restaurants.</p>
                <p>Q: This was true in Korea, too.</p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, in many parts of Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Throughout Asia. If they were coming back, particularly
                        I'm thinking of American males coming back; Vietnamese are beautiful young
                        ladies and I would imagine there would be a lot of attachments to at least
                        some of them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Oh, there were, without question. You had the usual range of this sort
                    of business going on. There were certainly people who had come back there to
                    find a bride. I mean, they were the usual deals that you see all over the world.
                    All you have to do is look in the back of the Washingtonian magazine, for
                    example. “Come over and get your lovely partner for life.”</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>There was established, before I finished my tour in Bangkok in 1995, a bar in
                    Saigon called Apocalypse Now. It was located near the National Assembly. It was
                    very popular with returnees. Also, there was a Vietnamese-American who opened a
                    first-class restaurant there also near the National Assembly. I'm sorry to say I
                    can't remember the name of it. It was a Vietnamese-style restaurant that was a
                    huge success. As I understand the story, the owner was among the first allowed
                    to come back to Vietnam in the late 1980s. He looked around, saw his
                    possibilities, went back to California, sold some of his assets and came back
                    with cash to open his restaurant. I think he has done very, very well.</p>
                <p>Little by little, lots of people came back and the Vietnamese government in that
                    side of their thinking promoted this. They wanted to have it because, like
                    tourism anywhere, it's income for the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get the feeling, being in Vietnam when you were
                        there, that the Communist rule was beginning to get quite a bit softer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, I think so. You would talk to the faceless bureaucrat about
                    something, and he or she would often give you the company line, “No, we can't do
                    this. Well, I'll have to refer this to a higher authority. Well, I'm not so
                    sure, let's see what we?” But, I got the distinct feeling that the Communistthe
                    people who firmly believed the company line, people who may have even personally
                    known Ho Chi Minh, or people who sat at his feet, as it werwere getting on in
                    years and they therefore were fewer and further between. During my time dealing
                    with the Vietnamese, the younger ones really couldn't do a great deal about the
                    situation, but I think they were just biding their time. I suspect that's going
                    on in China as we speak, as well.</p>
                <p>My belief in this regard has nothing to do with anything that anybody said to me.
                    No Vietnamese ever gave me a little elbow in the ribs, but I certainly felt it.
                    I don't mean to imply that Vietnam is going to be an American-style economy
                    tomorrow morning or next Thursday or a year from now. It is likely to be more
                    socialist, I suspect; a little like France perhaps. But, yes, the situatiothe

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you seeing signs of foreign newspapers and magazines
                        and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: These sorts of publication were available in certain areas. I'm not
                    sure what would've happened if a street sweeper from Cholon regularly went and
                    bought the New York Times in one of the hotels. I suspect if he did so, he might
                    have gotten a knock on the door. But sure, I, as a foreigner, could buy
                    virtually anything I wanted. My experience there was really before the Internet,
                    of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>

                        computer connection has probably changed everything.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I would imagine. The Internet existed, of course, but it was not
                    widespread. I personally can't address that issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to Bangkok itself, I realize you were not
                        directly involved in making the judgments of all this, but I've talked to
                        some people who have worked in Thailand at the time and were saying, “You
                        know as we looked at this, the refugees were more and more what we call
                        economic refugees and the NGOs and the others, I mean all of a sudden, if
                        you started denying this or looking too closely, you were essentially
                        breaking their rice bowl.” A bureaucracy had built up which was processing
                        refugees and you had to have refugees by hook or by crook in order to keep
                        it going. Did you see any of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Interesting observation. Yes, I would say that I would have to agree
                    with that; it did exist.</p>
                <p>I might throw in here something about the situation in Burma that resulted in
                    another refugee crisis. I refer, of course, to the bloody uprising after the
                    national election of 1988. So you had an entire new refugee business along the
                    Burma border. When I got to Bangkok in '92, there were camps run by Thai
                    authorities on the west side of the country. We weren't very involved with those
                    camps, but I did visit a number of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is when they had the election and the army led it and
                        then they basically slaughtered a number of their own countrymen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, that was what happened.</p>
                <p>I think it's instructive to note, in this conversation, that the Thai Ministry of
                    the Interiothe administrative organization that dealt with all refugee
                    issuehandled the Burma refugee situation very differently than they did on the
                    east, the Vietnam War, side. In 1975, refugees began to arrive in Thailand from
                    Vietnam and Laos, and later from Cambodia. The refugees entered along the
                    Lao-Cambodian border with Thailand. In a certain sense, wthe U.S. Governmensort
                    of ran that refugee situation. Now, that statement is a huge oversimplification,
                    but we spent a lot of money and we did a lot of things to manage the Vietnam War
                    refugee situation in Thailand. In post 1988, on the Burma side, however, the
                    Thais essentially ran it. We certainly had an input, but the Burma refugees
                    werand still armanaged by the Thais.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>While I was there, the young officer who was the Interior Ministry's man in
                    refugee issues and his deputy were transferred to different jobs without much
                    warning, at least to us. I think this was a sign that a significant part of the
                    Thai Government had decided that enough was enough, that the Thais should have
                    much greater input into the management of the refugee programs in their own
                    country.</p>
                <p>Which leads back to your question. We had processed these applicants for refugee
                    status in the camps since, essentially, 1979, and although other people did come
                    out from Vietnam, Laos and later Cambodia while the processing was going on, by
                    and large, there were very few people left in the camps who likely qualified for
                    refugee status by the time I got there. I guess it's fair to say that while
                    there were a number of Thais and NGOs who saw refugee processing as a job, I
                    think most people saw the handwriting on the wall and prepared to move on.</p>
                <p>During my three year tour in Bangkok, there were some very important valued
                    colleagues from the non-governmental side who found other work elsewhere and
                    were gone. During the time I was there, horrible things were going on in Africa
                    and if your interest in life had to do with being good to people who were
                    refugees, there were plenty of other places to go.</p>
                <p>In short, I didn't see the refugee “business” as something that would just
                    continue essentially on its own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think this is a good place to stop. We'll pick
                        this up the next time. Where did you go next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: In 1995 we got the opportunity to go back to Europe. I went to Bonn,
                    Germany, as Minister-Counselor for Consular Affairs. This was sheer good luck,
                    once again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ed, what fell apart and what came together to get you to
                        Bonn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Oh, it was just a strange series of circumstances, but the person I
                    replaced in Bonn, Michael Marine, went off to another assignment rather
                    unexpectedly, which meant that the MCCA job opened up without much warning. It
                    was rather late in the bidding season and a large number of people at our level
                    had already been assigned during the normal assignment processing. The pool of
                    people who might qualify for that job was rather small. Anyway, I applied for it
                    and got it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Bonn from '95 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: We were in Bonn for almost four yearI extended for the fourth year as
                    soon as I possibly could. My wife and I had not set foot in Europe in
                    approximately thirty years, and so the opportunity to work and play the tourist
                    on the Continent was just something that we didn't want to pass up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did your job consist of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: The August title of Minister Counselor for Consular Affairs basically
                    describes a person who is in charge of consular operations countrywide. Of
                    course, there are the chiefs of the consular sections in Frankfurt, in Berlin,
                    in Hamburg, D�sseldorf and Munich. The MCCA was responsible for coordinating
                    consular operations all over the country.</p>
                <p>The role of the minister counselor under normal circumstances, and to a degree
                    while I was there, was to ensure that there were not different policies in
                    different offices around the country. So that was the real job and, I suspect,
                    the job as it was for years.</p>
                <p>However, in Bonn, during my tour, there was a different element to the job
                    because the seat of the German government was moving from Bonn to Berlin. The
                    embassy, of course, was in the process of moving, too.</p>
                <p>Actually, quite a bit of embassy Bonn had already moved, or was in the process of
                    moving, to Berlin. So for the vast majority of the time I was there, the
                    American staff of the consular section in Bonn was just a vice consul and I. The
                    office in Bonn basically existed to provide whatever American services work that
                    needed to be done, which was very, very little, because our consular district
                    wasn't very big. It also continued to exist to provide diplomatic visas to
                    foreign embassy staff. So, as one of two people in the consular section, I must
                    say that I learned an awful lot. I did a lot of work that, quite frankly, as a
                    more senior officer, I hadn't had to do for a number of years. One minute I was
                    making what might be called “grand decisions” regarding consular work
                    countrywide, and the next minute I'm out looking at a visa application because
                    the vice consul was elsewhere. I learned a lot and I think that was very
                    useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the American consular establishment like in
                        Germany at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, there are a number of answers to that question. We had
                    relatively small consular operations in Munich, in Berlin, in Hamburg, to a
                    smaller degree in D�sseldorf, and I'll explain this element in a second. The
                    large operation was in Frankfurt. The consular operation in Stuttgart closed not
                    long after our arrival in Germany.</p>

                <p>Don't forget that the large number of American soldiers stationed in Germany,
                    had, I believe, gone down from something in the neighborhood of 300,000 to
                    100,000 (very, very rough figures) in the years since the fall of the Berlin
                    Wall. So the quantity of citizenship work for the U.S. military establishment
                    dropped off accordingly. Basically, all we did for the soldiers and civilians
                    was to issue passports. There were other operations, but mostly that was the big
                    job. The military, themselves, for example, handled all of the work that had to
                    be done whenever a GI ran afoul of the German law.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Registering births must've been a part of your
                        duties.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: That's true, of course; births and the occasional death. We did
                    different things, of course, with the civilians, i.e., spouses and civilian
                    workers, than we did with the soldier. So there was a great deal of work
                    involved with that.</p>
                <p>With regard to American Services, in general, we had a number of cases of U.S.
                    citizen civilians in jail, people who had broken German law. There also were
                    American business people in Germany who needed passport services and, again,
                    births and occasionally a death or other things. But I must say, it was a rather
                    sophisticated operation unlike other places where you have lots of backpackers
                    and so on.</p>
                <p>The Germans dealt with what I might term the “non-businessman,” i.e.,
                    backpackers, etc., in a pretty sophisticated and reasonable way, so many of the
                    type of problems we might have to deal with in other countries never even came
                    to our attention in Germany.</p>
                <p>And visas were a little different story, as well. For one thing, Germans enjoy
                    the visa waiver, which means that if a German citizen is going to the U.S. for
                    tourism or for business purposes for under 90 days, that person probably doesn't
                    need a visa. Of course, there were eleven or twelve other countries in Europe
                    that qualified for the visa waiver as well, so if you had a Frenchman or an
                    Italian or a Brit living in Germany, these people didn't need such visas either.
                    As a consequence, we didn't do very many non-immigrant visas for Germans or
                    other Europeans.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, we had applications for visas from a large number of
                    non-Germans, people from countries that didn't enjoy the visa waiver. Many of
                    these applications were from applicants who had come to Germany for the specific
                    purpose of applying for visas.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>Our biggest workload in this category was from Iranians. We had no consular
                    operation in Tehran, and so an Iranian might get up early one day in Tehran,
                    take the morning flight to Frankfurt, and the next day be in trying to get a
                    visa from us. Now that meant that the Frankfurt visa operation was rather
                    complicated. It's one thing to adjudicate a non-immigrant visa for somebody who
                    lives in your neighborhood. If he or she says, “I own a clothing store,” you can
                    check on that if you want to or you can check on things by just asking a few
                    questions. Well, that's not true with people from so far away. Language
                    difficulties, too, cause some problems. So the operation was really quite
                    different.</p>
                <p>Immigrant visas in Germany were handled solely in Frankfurt. That operation, too,
                    included a large number of applicants from other countries, so that was a
                    complicating factor, as well.</p>
                <p>But, as far as my own workload was concerned, I spent a good deal of time just
                    working with the administrative people regarding the move of our American
                    Services operation to D�sseldorf, our non-immigrant visa processing to Frankfurt
                    and the move of the MCCA office to Berlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any thought of putting a consular post in what
                        had been East Germany; in Leipzig or Dresden or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: There is a consulate in Leipzig. Sorry, I think I failed to mention
                    Leipzig when we were speaking about this a few minutes ago. The Leipzig
                    consulate opened fairly quickly after the wall came down. I think it is fair to
                    say that one of the main reasons the consulate was established there was to
                    demonstrate to Germans, and to the world in general, our support for Germany as
                    one country. The idea was to make clear that there is no East Germany or West
                    Germany anymore; there is just the Federal Republic of Germany. The consulate in
                    Leipzig did not do visas, if I remember correctly. They did passports and
                    American Services work, but people went up to Berlin or elsewhere if they needed
                    a visa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying the Germans dealt with the student; the
                        backpacker type who got into minor problems, and this “sophisticated
                        manner,” what does that mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, I think it's fair to say that the German authorities would view
                    your American or your Canadian or your British “backpacker” as simply a tourist.
                    Germans certainly are not willing to accept breaking of the rules, but they
                    would be more inclined to give “backpackers” who break the law a slap on the
                    wrist rather than throw the miscreant in jail, which was quite often the case in
                    other less developed countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself dealing with the consular side of
                        the German foreign office?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, I did. The head of consular affairs during the entire four years
                    I was there was a marvelous diplomat, Herr Born. He spoke English, of course,
                    but also Italian and Spanish. I believe his wife was Italian. We dealt with a
                    variety of issues including Hague convention issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that The Hague, capital of the Netherlands?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, the capital of the Netherlands where the Hague Convention was
                    signed. The Hague Convention pertains to the question of children who were taken
                    by one parent against the wishes of the other parent from one Hague Convention
                    country to another Hague Convention country. For example, suppose a German woman
                    is married to an American man and they move to the States to live. Then, let's
                    assume for whatever reason later on the woman is unhappy with her home life, so
                    she moves back to Germany. And let's assume they have a child and she takes the
                    child with her, without her husband or a court's permission when she goes back
                    to her family home to live.</p>
                <p>As both parents come from countries that are signatories of the Hague Convention,
                    then this convention was brought into play to deal with the situation.</p>
                <p>It was a very complicated business and it took forever to get anything done, so
                    we dealt with Hague Convention details to the degree that we could. I must say
                    that the Office of the Legal Advisor here in the State Department dealt with
                    these things much more than we did, but wand the attorneys in the Bureau of
                    Consular Affairdid have Hague Convention responsibilities, as well. So I had a
                    number of dealings with Herr Born on Hague Convention details.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is a case that was being brought up in the
                        Washington Post about a child or one or two who are, I think, the mother
                        took the children back to Germany and then she either abandoned them or was
                        put into an institution or something, and the children were given to foster
                        parents or something like this and the father was completely cut out. So
                        every time our president goes to Germany or something this case comes up.
                        Was that around during your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: No, I read about that in the Post as well, but I have no recollection
                    whatever of dealing with that particular situation while I was in Germany. The
                    problem there is that there's never any neat answer to these things. You cannot,
                    in good conscience, say, “Well, because this child is the offspring of an
                    American, the American parent has the right to the child.” The procedures, by
                    and large, are dealt with by local law authorities, and, as you might suspect,
                    the Germans tended to take the side of their own nationals. The Americans, of
                    course, took the side of their own nationals. I don't really want to suggest for
                    a minute that these people were doing this unreasonably, but it was a point of
                    view that when the question was sort of even on one side or another, then the
                    Germans sort of won the toss, if you will, if a German court was the one tasked
                    to make the Hague Convention decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was happening at the time you were there? Was Bonn
                        going to remain as a post or was it going to be completely phased out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, when Lisa and I left Bonn in late summer of 1999, there was to
                    be a portion of the embassy that was to remain under U.S. jurisdiction for use
                    of our military people. Although they were going to stay there for a time, I'd
                    be surprised if they are still there now.</p>
                <p>Also, when we closed our Bonn consular operation, our Bonn American Services
                    operation moved to D�sseldorf. D�sseldorf had been “downsized” sometime in the
                    1980s or early 1990s. It becamessentiallan operation that dealt with solely with
                    U.S. commercial issues, so there were no consular operations there during my
                    stay in Germany. But it was decided, as Bonn was closing, that because of the
                    number of American businesses in and around D�sseldorf, we should again have an
                    American Services operation there.</p>
                <p>One problem was that about this time the building where the consulate was located
                    was sold to another owner, so the consulate was going to move to another place.
                    But the Department couldn't seem to get its act together in terms of doing the
                    necessary things to finalize this move. So, just as I was leaving, the small
                    American Services operation that had moved to D�sseldorf moved back to Bonn.
                    D�sseldorf's American Services operation had to work out of our consular
                    premises in Bonn for several weeks or months until the new D�sseldorf office was
                    ready.</p>
                <p>The American Services operation finally moved back to the city of D�sseldorf. I
                    don't know whether there is any U.S. military presence in the old embassy now,
                    or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any cases or problems that caused you
                        particular concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: In fact, no. This, in a consular sense, was a very easy job. As I say,
                    I spent a great deal of time thinking about the move to other places and
                    administrative chores. But traditional consular work? No, no problems leap to
                    mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've talked to people who concern the German-American
                        Institute here and all. The head of it was telling me one time that there
                        was concern, because at one point a lot of Americans were taking German, and
                        not many do now. The number is going down, and as far as tourism goes,
                        people, if they go into Europe, it's going to be Britain, France, Italy and
                        Spain. Germany, although it's sort of the major country in Europe, has the
                        reputation of being rather expensive. American attention isn't there, as far
                        as people visiting and getting to know it, as all of us who were of a
                        certain age, did. Was this a concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, this was a concern. I know a variety of Germans from different
                    stations in life who would mention this one way or another. But, what you
                    described is true. I think it's fair to say that the average American, who looks
                    at his or her bank account and decides that this is the time to take a trip to
                    Europe, does not think about Germany as a destination, at least in the first
                    instance, if at all.</p>
                <p>That's another little issue that I might get into, by the way. Most Americans who
                    do know anything about Germany, tend to focus on Bavaria or Baden-W�rttemberg or
                    other parts of the south of Germany where U.S. military bases tend to be because
                    they or a relative was once stationed in Germany in the U.S. Army or Air Force.
                    I noted that many of these people are, in a certain sense, amazed to find that
                    there exists a huge expanse of the north part of Germany about which they know
                    nothing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see, in the time you were there, tensions;
                        problems that came to your attention about the melding of East and West
                        Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, there were lots of rather snide comments that “West” Germans
                    themselves would make at, or about, “Eastern” Germans sometimes. To be sure,
                    there were two generations, at a minimum, of people who grew up under different
                    philosophies; they were at a rather different view of life, and there was
                    tension. Now, of course, this is a huge oversimplification, but an Easterner
                    would tend to think, “It's the state's businesobligatioto take care of me.”
                    Westerners, too, might look at this in similar terms, but not nearly to the
                    extent of the Easterners. So there is tension. The result of these sorts of
                    difference in thinking was that the country was not becoming one as rapidly as,
                    I think, most Germans thought. It'll take, I would say, another generation or
                    two before this is smoothed over and even then, I don't know.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the opening up of the Stasi files create a certain
                        nightmare for the consular side, because if you've got a file and you want
                        to check it, you've got to check on somebody and it would be almost better
                        not to know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, we didn't have reason to get into these files for most people.
                    The reason why I say that is that the people we might have been interested in,
                    i.e. people who might have had some visa problems because of their World War II
                    experience, were either people who had been vetted long before I came to the
                    scene or they had died.</p>
                <p>I did have an amazing experience, though, related to this subject. One day, I got
                    a call from Herr Born, the head of the Consular Affairs Division of the Foreign
                    Ministry, about a German former ambassador who was having some visa
                    difficulties. He asked whether I could look into the matter.</p>
                <p>Well, I invited the gentleman in question to my office, and he promptly came.
                    Actually, he only lived a few blocks away from the Embassy. He was a very
                    interesting person who had an absolutely fascinating story, which I would like
                    to tell briefly.</p>
                <p>In his youth, he wanted to become a German Foreign Service officer. He did the
                    usual studies and then came, I think, to Brown University, here in the States,
                    to study and to polish his English. After some time in the U.S., around 1935 or
                    1936 he came back to Germany. Then not too long after, he moved to Japan where
                    he studied Japanese. He came back to Germany around 1938 and applied for an
                    appointment in the German Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>He was told that yes, he would qualify, but that there were no openings right
                    then. They said they would let him know, so he went to work for a Japanese
                    organization of some sort that was located in Germany. This gave him an
                    opportunity to use Japanese regularly and to polish his facility in that
                    language. It turns out that while he was there Heinrich Himmler and other
                    worthies on the German side came to him to get information about the Japanese
                    people who worked there or otherwise about people they apparently had record of
                    in their files. Thethe Germans and the Japaneswere not really allies at that
                    time, and even when they became allies, basically after the war began, there was
                    a certain amount of distrust between them. Anyway, the future ambassador didn't
                    want to, but he had to provide information to German intelligence authorities
                    about certain Japanese.</p>
                <p>Just a few months before the war began, i.e. September of 1939, he was taken into
                    the Foreign Service and was assigned to the German Embassy in Cairo where he
                    stayed for several months.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>You remember that at that time, Britain was essentially the overseer of Egypt, so
                    when Germany came into the war, which was just a few months after he was
                    assigned to Cairo, the Germans had to close their embassy. He was then assigned
                    to Tokyo. This was after the Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact had been signed, and so the
                    Germans and Russians were, at the time, great friends. He took a train all the
                    way to Vladivostok, and then a boat down into Japan. He spent the entire war in
                    Japan at the German Embassy there.</p>
                <p>By chance, at about the time the future ambassador and I were talking, I had been
                    reading a book about the famous German spy, Richard Sorge, who was in Japan
                    before and during the Second World War. Sorge was a German, although he was
                    actually a Russian spy. Sorge's mother was from Baku, Russia. He was born there
                    and grew up largely in the Soviet Union. In the '30s, Sorge went to Tokyo and
                    spied on Germany for Russia. So, I asked the ambassador whether he knew this
                    famous person, Richard Sorge?</p>
                <p>He responded, “Of course, I know him. Every German in Japan who was there wanted
                    to know him. He was such a personality.” I just found it incredible to actually
                    be gazing upon somebody who had known this person about whom at that time I was
                    reading. And that's just a little part of the story.</p>
                <p>As I said, the future ambassador spent the entire Second World War in Japan in
                    the embassy there. After the war, he stayed on as an officer in their embassy,
                    and was there, I think he said, until 1947 or 1948 when he was finally able to
                    come back to Germany.</p>
                <p>Of course, there was some question about what he had been reporting to Ribbentrop
                    in the '30s, but the new (post-war) German authorities finally decided that
                    essentially he was a diplomat and nothing more, and so he went back into the
                    Foreign Ministry. He later became the German equivalent to DCM in the U.S. and
                    later ambassador to other countries.</p>
                <p>He was an absolutely fascinating individual. I know that a book was written about
                    him and a there was a film made about his life, although I don't have details on
                    that. But because of the book and film, he needed a visa to travel to the United
                    States to provide details for the making of the film. (I wish I could give you
                    the name of the film, but I can't come up with it.) In any event, although to
                    get diplomatic visas was no problem, because of this having “reported” to
                    Ribbentrop, there was an unfavorable file on him. We were able to work that out,
                    ultimately, so he was able to obtain a regular non-immigrant visa.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>The other thing I wanted to talk about, if I may, is that one of the jobs of the
                    head of the consular operation in Germany is to be the U.S. representative to an
                    organization called the International Tracing Service, which is managed by the
                    International Red Cross. The International Tracing Service is an organization
                    that compiled all the information they could get about people who were prisoners
                    in German concentration camps. So, for example, if you had a close relative who
                    had been in a Nazi concentration camp, you could try, through this organization,
                    to find out what information was available about your relative's stay in the
                    camp.</p>
                <p>There is a huge repository of information in the town of Bad Arelson, which is in
                    the northern part of the German state of Hesse. There they have files from many
                    Nazi concentration camps. After the wall came down, they got additional
                    information from camps situated behind the Iron Curtain.</p>
                <p>The way it works here in the U.S., for example, is that if you had a close
                    relative who was in a Nazi concentration camp, you could request all available
                    information about this relative by making application to the Baltimore Chapter
                    of the American Red Cross, which is the International Tracing Service
                    representative in the U.S. Or if you're in France, you would go to the French
                    representative organization, a veteran's organization, I think, to request all
                    available information about your relative. You have to make a case that you have
                    reason to have this information: basically you have to be a close relative of
                    the person involved. My experience with the International Tracing Service was
                    fascinating, largely because of the people I dealt with.</p>
                <p>The Berlin Document Center is a repository of this sort of information, as well,
                    and the International Tracing Service also has access to those files. I had a
                    tour of the Center and it was a little frightening. Of course, this was long
                    before computers, so all of this information is hand-written in wonderful old
                    German script. It was a little frightening to think of this army of clerks
                    sitting around writing all sorts of information about you, your uncle, your
                    relative, or whatever it might be, who is Jewish, was Jewish, might have been
                    Jewish, or rumor had it was Jewish. This, unfortunately, was an important
                    activity from German standpoint at that time. Homosexuals and Gypsies were also
                    badly treated under the Nazi system.</p>
                <p>There were the representatives from the different member countries. Lisa and I
                    have kept in contact with a number of them. I thought that was one of the
                    highlights of my career in Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, you were helping close things down, weren't
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: As far as the Bonn embassy was concerned, yes. When you say it that
                    way, you remind me of a point that, perhaps, is relevant here as well. Germany
                    was unusual, in my experience. I've been in a lot of embassies and consulates,
                    but Germany was unusual simply for the following reason: the U.S. was among the
                    countries that were victorious in the Second World War.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>In 1945 we came in there and ultimately ended up all over Germany along with our
                    British, French and other colleagues. From '45 to '49, we were occupiers. The
                    Cold War, as it began to gel, gave us good reason, I think, to get on the right
                    side of the Germans and we did. In 1949, the new Chancellor Konrad Adenauer and
                    his associates ultimately put together modern Germany. That, of course, is a
                    huge oversimplification, but that's a sort of an overview.</p>
                <p>The U.S. Embassy in Bonn in 1995 was a product, to a very large degree, of our
                    having gone in to Germany in 1945 as occupiers. For example, we had assigned to
                    the embassy a Catholic priest and two Protestant pastors. I believe a rabbi
                    could have been assigned there, but none was. Just before we got to Bonn, a
                    newly assigned Catholic priest arrived there, Father Steve McNally. He waand
                    ijust a marvelous individual. He's now down in southern Virginia, by the way,
                    with his own parish.</p>
                <p>But I mention Father McNally as an example of the sorts of unique things that
                    went on in Germany, as a result of our having been there as an occupying force.
                    In 1949, the new Adenauer government gave us, for example, the location where
                    apartments and houses were built and a large number of American Embassy people
                    lived. It was a corner, if you will, of a park in Bonn, near the Rhine River.
                    The U.S. acquired a large amount of official property in Germany as a
                    consequence of our having been one of the victors of World War II. So
                    dismantling all this was a part of our job during my tour there. I didn't
                    personally get into this a great deal, but I was involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything else we should cover in Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Oh, I don't think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, in '99, what happened next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: In 1999 I was sixty-three years old, and you know in the Foreign
                    Service one must retire at the age of sixty-five. Knowing that this was cominI
                    had less than two years to go before being mandatorily retireI looked for a
                    Washington assignment. Frankly, my idea was to come here to Washington, look
                    around and see what I wanted to do next. Did I want to retire immediately? Did I
                    want to move to someplacLas Vegas for example? My wife and I simply had made no
                    decision even though we talked about it many, many times.</p>
                <p>So, I came to an agreement with the Bureau of Consular Affairs to come to the
                    Bureau's executive office and work on a special project there for a year.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>In June of 1999, this was all set, and it seemed like a good plan to me. Then out
                    of the blue, I received a phone call from Robyn Bishop, Deputy Executive
                    Director of the Executive Office, Bureau of Consular Affairs. She was the number
                    two person in that office and was essentially the chief Foreign Service
                    personnel officer, if you will, for the Consular Affairs Bureau.</p>
                <p>She said, “Ed, we have an opening as consul general in Guadalajara, Mexico, and I
                    know that you had expressed interest in that before. Are you still interested?”
                    So, after I picked myself up off the floor, I said I thought I was. She
                    explained that somebody had retired unexpectedly, etc., etc., and there were
                    some other personnel changes, so all of a sudden there was this opening. Now,
                    maybe she was just being nice to me knowing full well that I was about to
                    retire, but she finished the conversation with, “I can't guarantee it, but if
                    you are interested we'll put your name in that hat and let's see what
                    develops.”</p>
                <p>Well, I went home and spoke to my wife that evening. We agreed that there were
                    any number of reasons for us not to take that assignment. The plans for the
                    future would be far easier to make from here in Washington, rather than abroad.
                    And there's the question of locality pay, which is an issue that one doesn't
                    ignore.</p>
                <p>But Lisa and I spent roughly eight seconds discussing the matter, then we said,
                    “Let's try to get it; let's go anyway.” Sonce again, sheer good lucI was then
                    assigned to Guadalajara, Mexico, as consul general. We got there in September or
                    October of '99.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there until?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Until June of 2001, about twenty months or so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Guadalajara has got the reputation of being sort of the
                        retirement home of a great many Americans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Well, that's true. The number is a little elusive. You have to nail
                    down the definition. There are people who live there essentially permanently,
                    and some who just come only for the winter, “snowbirds.” Those people generally
                    come on tourist cards, valid for a six-month stay. So, you have a number from
                    20,000 to 50,000 or more U.S. retirees in the general neighborhood of
                    Guadalajara. My Canadian colleague there believeand I have every reason to think
                    he was right - that even more Canadians than Americans are retired there. And,
                    of course, there are many other nationalities, as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>One main reason for all these foreigners is, I think, the huge lake, Lake
                    Chapala, located about a forty-five minute drive from Guadalajara. It's the
                    largest lake in Mexico. Unfortunately, for certain reasons, it's getting smaller
                    and smaller and dirtier and dirtier, I'm sorry to say. But it is a placwhen the
                    lake was wide, clean and beautifuwhere over the years a lot of Americans and
                    other foreigners have retired.</p>
                <p>Mexico makes it very convenienas do many Central American countrieto get the
                    appropriate visa to go there. As a retiree, you can bring in certain things,
                    such as a car, duty free. You can bring in a refrigerator and other items that
                    are relatively expensive in Mexico. They make this as easy as possible to
                    attract people because it's good for the economy.</p>
                <p>As you might suspect, a very significant portion of our work in Guadalajara was
                    attending to these Americans. Because a large number were retirees are older
                    folks, we had a large number of deaths to handle. We also had a complete
                    operation with several employees funded by the Social Security Administration
                    that dealt with federal benefits; all federal benefits, not just Social
                    Security.</p>
                <p>Q: How did you find dealing with the Mexican government?</p>
                <p>WILKINSON: I found it easy. I would apologize regularly to visiting firemen,
                    Congress people and so on, because I found myself describing Mexico and Mexicans
                    in a way that made me sound like a was a member of the Guadalajara Chamber of
                    Commerce. I really, truly enjoyed working and living in Mexico. Now, I'm not
                    going to suggest that every last Mexican was just wonderful. Corruption is
                    endemic in Latin countries, I am sorry to say. It went on there, although, I
                    would say, with the election of President Fox and the ousting of the
                    Institutional Revolutionary Party, the PRI, that improved a bit. But corruption
                    was not, by and large, a problem that we had to deal with regularly. It didn't
                    cause us great problems. Quite the contrary; I would say Mexican officialdom
                    worked very hard to be as reasonable with us as they could be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about drugs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, drugs are a major issue in Mexico. They are readily available.
                    I'm not really sure whether they are more or less available than in the U.S., or
                    at least in certain parts of the U.S., but they're certainly available. And
                    cheaper, I would say. The larger concern, though, is drug trafficking -
                    something that concerned us Americans for obvious reasons. Our U.S. Drug
                    Enforcement Administration has many officers stationed at our embassies and
                    consulates around the world. They work with the local authorities in this regard
                    and yes, drugs remain a major concern to us.</p>

                        nasty case of one of our drug agents being kidnaped and killed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, there was the case, I can't remember the yeaI would say in the
                    middle '80s - when a Drug Enforcement Administration officer, Enrique Camarena,
                    stationed in Guadalajara at the time, was simply kidnaped then brutally
                    murdered. This is, I would suggest, the sort of thing that our Drug Enforcement
                    people have to contend with worldwide. It is a nasty, dangerous business. But
                    their job is to get out amongst the people, find out what's going on regarding
                    trafficking, and that's what they do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in that at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Security was always an issue, yes, but I personally did not feel in
                    the slightest that I was in danger. The state of Jalisco, where Guadalajara is
                    located, provided the American consul general a full-time bodyguard. Agustine
                    was a marvelous policeman whom I think the world of. He is the kind of
                    policemaand friend you'd want anywhere, in anyplace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about problems with Americans? I've heard reports
                        that there are parts of Mexico where the people are driving around in their
                        cars and they may be stopped either by policemen or pseudo-policemen or
                        something and robbed and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, sometimes this happens. There is a tourist police operation that
                    attempts to control that sort of thing. Insofar as I know, these people are
                    pretty clean. The tourist police travel up and down the major highways and if
                    you, as a tourist, break down or have other problems they'll help you.</p>
                <p>I might throw in here the observation that, as you may remember I was stationed
                    in Mexico from '67 to '69 and then again from 1999 to 2001. There were huge,
                    huge differences between those two tours as far as life for a foreigner in
                    Mexico is concerned. It is certainly not totally perfect, but it is much, much
                    better than it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself, on instructions from the embassy,
                        making representations to the local authorities concerning crime or
                        problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>WILKINSON: I think the answer to that, in general, is no. I do remember one case
                    that is still pending in which we worked closely with the embassy and with the
                    State Department. An American newspaper reporter, Philip True, who had spent a
                    number of years in Mexico and was married to a Mexican lady, decided to hike
                    northward from the northern part of the state of Jalisco. He walked into what is
                    essentially an indigenous Indian reservation. He was hiking through there and
                    was later found dead.</p>
                <p>He worked for the San Antonio News Express, I think it's called, and the editor
                    and the owner of the newspaper have worked very, very hard, together with Mr.
                    True's wife, to try to get satisfaction. But the case continues to drag on and
                    on. They are very unhappy that two particular indigenous people thought to have
                    perpetrated the crime have not been brought to justice. [These two were
                    recentlApril 200convicted; the case is to be appealed, I think.]</p>
                <p>I think that would be very difficult to do, quite honestly, even though there is
                    some circumstantial evidence. I really don't think that you're going to find the
                    kind of evidence that will be necessary to convict. I don't know nearly enough
                    about it to make any comment other than that this is just a gut feeling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Americans in jail? Did you have a number?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: Yes, a rather small number I think, comparatively speaking. The jails
                    were okay, I guess. If you have a little money to spend, you can make your life
                    satisfactory or even a little better. I wouldn't want to leave anybody with the
                    impression that life is a piece of cake in these jails, but our people who have
                    visited them have not come back with problems, complaints, unhappiness. I think
                    they are okay in the big scheme of things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then you left there this year, 2001?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILKINSON: We just left there last June. But before we left, Lisa and I drove up
                    to the town where we got married, Mazatl�n, Sinaloa, about five hours north of
                    Guadalajara. We went to the chapel where we were married. It hadn't changed
                    much, although the beautiful tree in the front courtyard was gone. We had a
                    chance to look around and see how Mazatl�n had changed. We even met some friends
                    that we knew thirty-odd years before.</p>
                <p>Anyway, when the time came and we had to leave, we drove northward to the town of
                    Zacatecas and later to Saltillo, then up to San Antonio where we had the good
                    fortune to have a cup of coffee with my predecessor in Guadalajara (who was also
                    with us in Korea) who happened to be in town, O.P. Garza. O.P. is now ambassador
                    to Nicaragua. Then we drove on up to Washington and that's it.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>Let me finish with my retirement story. Many people say the Foreign Service
                    doesn't treat its retirees appropriately in terms of a “good-bye.” They
                    certainly don't do anything that compares with the treatment of our military
                    colleagues.</p>
                <p>Well, when I finished everything that I needed to do in the Department of State
                    regarding my retirement, all the papers signed and doing that, I was told to go
                    over to a particular office and turn in my State Department identification. So,
                    I thought, 'Well, this is it.' I went over the office, went up to the person
                    behind the counter. I said, “I've just retired; here's my ID card.” The person
                    took it out of my hand rather abruptly, turned back to the computer screen and
                    said, “I'll take you out of the system.”</p>
                <p>That, after some 39 years, was my goodbye to the State Department.</p>
