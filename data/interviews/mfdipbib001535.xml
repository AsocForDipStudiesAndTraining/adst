                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John, let's start in the beginning. When and where were
                        you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I was born April 26, 1945 in Ithaca, New York. My father was a professor
                    at Cornell University at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the family; let's talk on your father's
                        side first. What do you know about the Cushings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: They came from the village of Hingham, England which was the same
                    village that Abraham Lincoln came from. They had some religious disagreements
                    with the church so about half the town of Hingham sold all their possessions and
                    chartered a ship in 1638 to sail to North America, where they established the
                    town of Hingham, Massachusetts, which is now a suburb of Boston. My ancestor is
                    Matthew. Matthew sailed over and I think John was also born in England so it is
                    Matthew, John, Matthew, Matthew, Leavitt, Leavitt, Leavitt, Francis Marion,
                    Marion Jay, and Robert Leavitt Cushing, my father. I am the eleventh
                    generation.</p>
                <p>Farther back than that, they were Vikings, descended from Hrolf, or Rollo. They
                    were Norsemen, they came into northern France and converted to Christianity and
                    got some land there. One of my ancestors was a half brother to William the
                    Conqueror so the family got a fairly large tract of land in England, southwest
                    of Norwich.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>My great grandfather was too young for the Civil War but two of his three elder
                    brothers fought. The eldest brother was impressed into the Emergency
                    Pennsylvania Reserves during the invasion of 1863 but didn't see any combat, but
                    the two others, Benjamin Jay and Leavitt Wilson Cushing both fought with the
                    Army Potomac throughout most of the war. They were both wounded at
                    Fredericksburg. Leavitt was wounded again at Gettysburg so he was put into a
                    hospital in Philadelphia. He got out just in time for the battles of the
                    Wilderness and Spotsylvania and then fought at Petersburg in June of 1864. They
                    were both with Company G of the 53rd Pennsylvania Volunteer Infantry. Some
                    foolish officer sent them out on a large-scale reconnaissance without any
                    support or skirmishers or anything so 1,600 Union soldiers were rounded up by
                    the Confederates and were kept on Belle Isle near Richmond for a while, and then
                    they were put on a rickety old train to go to Andersonville, but between
                    Lynchburg and Danville there was a break in the rail lines so they were marched
                    and they stopped one night in a field.The guards told them they could go down to
                    the stream by the field and get a cup of water whenever they wanted. They didn't
                    have to check in or anything so Leavitt was down there during the daytime
                    getting a cup of water. He noticed sort of a shallow, natural depression in the
                    bank so he went down there about three in the morning. I think he mentioned
                    briefly to the Confederate guard that he was going to get a drink of water and
                    scooped out the hole a little more with his tin cup, hiding the dirt and then
                    crawled in backwards pulling in a bunch of brush in over himself. When they
                    marched away that morning they couldn't find him and they didn't have time to
                    wait around so they just left without him.</p>
                <p>Two little boys were looking for souvenirs from where all these Union soldiers
                    had been held prisoner and so one of them actually fell through the hole and
                    landed on him. He said, “Don't worry. I won't hurt you,” brushed himself off,
                    and took off into the woods.</p>
                <p>It took him about five or six weeks to get back to the Union lines in West
                    Virginia. He would sometimes stop at a house and ask for food and they would
                    give him something or occasionally he would dig up some potatoes, milk a cow,
                    pick some berries or something, but he managed. He had to outrun and evade
                    groups of pursuers at least twice, but he finally found an old farmer who told
                    him where the Union lines were and allowed him to stay at his house, although
                    they were going to have a religious meeting there. He told him he'd better take
                    a couple of books and go into the woods because there were some Confederate
                    sympathizers who would be coming to the meeting and he didn't want his house
                    burned down.</p>
                <p>At any rate, he made it back to the Union lines in West Virginia, got some new
                    clothes, and hitched rides on various trains back to northern Pennsylvania. He
                    had lost about 25 pounds by then. He was down to about say, 5' 8” and 125. He
                    weighed 150 before he was captured.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>He went back to his hometown of Ulysses, Pennsylvania and took some time off. He
                    wrote to the captain that he had escaped and he wanted some time off. He was
                    there until about January, 1865 at which point he decided to rejoin his regiment
                    so he caught a series of trains and a boat and got all the way back down to
                    Petersburg. He was there when the Confederate lines collapsed in early April so
                    he was at Appomattox with his brother when Lee surrendered. He was mustered out
                    June 30.</p>
                <p>Leavitt's brother Benjamin actually rose from private to brevet second
                    lieutenant, was put in charge of the commissary so he escaped some of the severe
                    fighting of the later part of the war because he was bringing up supplies and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>My great grandfather, Francis Marion Cushing was 18 when the war ended. The farm
                    where they lived grew timothy hay which was for the draft horses of Philadelphia
                    and New York City. They just shipped the hay on the rail lines to the cities to
                    feed all the horses that were in use at the time.</p>
                <p>It was concluded the farm was too small to support all of them so in 1872 he went
                    out to Nebraska with a few other people, got to the end of the railway and then
                    walked north until he found a good place, a slight hill overlooking the Loup
                    River and became a homesteader, sod buster, dug a little a hill and proved up
                    his claim. He had 640 acres. As soon as he had it fenced off and got title to
                    the land, he went off up to the Black Hills and found work digging sluices for
                    gold mining companies.He then became a bridge carpenter for a railroad company,
                    not the original transcontinental railway but one of the other ones. I have some
                    letters from him because I was in Ulysses Pennsylvania to visit the graves of
                    Leavitt and Benjamin, and a librarian there gave me the name and number of a
                    relative descended from Benjamin. I got in touch with her and she had saved four
                    of my great grandfather's letters that he had written; two from Nebraska, one
                    from Idaho and one from eastern Oregon as he was building bridges for the
                    railways.</p>
                <p>He also hunted sometimes. If he got tired of building a bridge or if there wasn't
                    any work that day, he would get an advance on his pay, buy ammunition and hunt
                    antelope and buffalo and then sell the meat to the railway to feed to the work
                    crews.</p>
                <p>My grandfather was born in 1887 and was a very promising baseball pitcher as a
                    young man. He was scouted by the St. Louis Browns but his mother was a very
                    devout Christian and said, “You cannot become a baseball player because you will
                    be forced to associate with men of low character,” so he was scouted but did not
                    sign up. He was offered a position on one of their farm teams but his mother
                    would not allow him to go.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>So my father was raised on a farm in Nebraska. My grandfather died in 1935 due to
                    an accident on the farm while my father was at University of Nebraska. My
                    grandmother leased the farm out and moved to Lincoln, Nebraska and became a
                    housemother at a sorority while my father went to school. My father met my
                    mother at the University of Nebraska. They married in 1938. He got a Masters
                    Degree at the University of Minnesota, then was a professor at Cornell at the
                    time I was born but he then got an offer to work for Hawaiian Pineapple Company,
                    Dole Pineapple, so we were out there from '47 to '49. Then he decided he would
                    go back to Cornell for awhile and resume teaching so we moved back to Ithaca for
                    two years. He then got an offer to be the assistant director of the Pineapple
                    Research Institute in Honolulu because the director had Lou Gehrig's disease and
                    needed someone to help him, so he was the assistant director for two years, from
                    1951 to '53, when the director died. After that he became the director. He did
                    that for about eleven years and then he became the director of the Hawaiian
                    Sugar Planter's Association Experiment Station. He did that until his retirement
                    and then he worked for AID on various contracts. He went over to China and did a
                    bunch of agricultural research projects for them in China and at one point,
                    working with the Chinese government, he designed a multiyear program for all the
                    agricultural research to take place in China. He traveled to Laos and South
                    Africa and China and various places, on contract, and then he eventually
                    retired.</p>
                <p>My mother passed away in 1990 as a result of injuries suffered due to a fall. My
                    father moved up to Raft Island near Tacoma a few years later to live near my
                    brother and then he died in 2001 at the age of 87.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about your mother's side of the family. What do
                        you know about them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I know very little except they were Loyalists during the Revolutionary
                    War and so after the war their house was burned down and they fled to Canada and
                    so for a number of generations they lived in Canada. My mother was born in
                    Greenland, Michigan which no longer exists, but went to school either in Lauriam
                    or Calumet. Her father was sort of ne'er do well, I guess, never really held a
                    steady job and I don't know if he drank or what but I know my mother's family
                    kind of fell apart and she was placed under the care of an older sister who
                    lived in Nebraska and was able to offer her a place to live, and she was
                    admitted to the University of Nebraska and worked her way through. I know she
                    worked in the library. I have never met either of my grandfathers. My paternal
                    grandfather was killed in an accident in 1935. My maternal grandfather
                    disappeared. I was shown one photograph of him by my father and asked if I
                    wanted a copy of the photograph and I said, “No, I don't think so.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it you mention your mother's side, they were
                        Loyalists in the Revolutionary War. On your father's side with a Francis
                        Marion name of the Swamp Fox there must have been, they must have been on
                        the Revolutionary side.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>CUSHING: That's true. One or two of them served in the militia. I don't know if
                    they were in the regular Continental Army but they were I think around Hingham,
                    Massachusetts at the time and if a local military emergency came up, they served
                    on the side of the revolutionaries.</p>
                <p>The family moved from Hingham to southern New York at the time of my great, great
                    grandfather, and then my great grandfather was born along with most of his
                    siblings in very southern New York but then they settled in Ulysses,
                    Pennsylvania in Potter County, just south of the state line, and that's where
                    Company G of the 53rd Pennsylvania was raised.</p>
                <p>Within the same family we have one Cushing who was minister to China, we have
                    Harvey Cushing, the brain surgeon and Alonzo Hereford Cushing who was the young
                    artillery officer who was manning the last Union cannon during Pickett's Charge,
                    who was killed at his post, his brother William Barker Cushing who commanded a
                    federal gunboat that sank the Confederate ram Albemarle in 1864 and subsequently
                    was on patrol on Cuba when an American citizen was captured and detained. He
                    told the Spanish if they didn't let this American go, he would shell the city of
                    Havana so they allowed the American to go free.</p>
                <p>That's pretty much it. My mother was never very enthusiastic about talking about
                    her family. She was considerably younger than her siblings so she alluded to the
                    fact that she was probably an accident. At any rate, she studied very hard. She
                    got good grades, she got into the University of Nebraska and so forth but I
                    don't think she had a particularly easy life. She said when the Depression came,
                    they didn't notice because they were already so poor that the Depression made
                    very little difference in how they were living.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your mother graduate from college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Yes, they both graduated. My mother graduated in 1938, my father in
                    1936. He then did some graduate work at the University of Minnesota but in 1944
                    was offered a teaching position at Cornell University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what subject?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: In agronomy and plant genetics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were born in 1945 in Ithaca?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: That's correct.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in Ithaca?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I was there from '45 to '47, then moved over to Wahiawa on the island of
                    Oahu from '47 to '49 and then moved back from '49 to '51 so I was there from
                    birth until two years of age and then from four to six. I have some memories of
                    the time around 1950, 1951.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were your real memories sort of kicking in after '51?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I remember bits about Ithaca. We lived near the Morse Chain Company and
                    the Allen-Wales Adding Machine Company. You could hear the boom of the
                    industrial machinery at night and there were parking lots for those two
                    companies so I used to sit by the side of the exit road that led onto South
                    Aurora Street and watch all the workers driving home from work. There was a hill
                    we used to sled down in the winter. I went to kindergarten and part of first
                    grade at South Hill Elementary School. My teacher was Mrs. Elsie Hanes. I left
                    there around Thanksgiving in '51 and my dad took us to Philadelphia to see the
                    Liberty Bell and to the Gettysburg Battlefield. For some reason he thought we
                    should see it, so the first time I saw the Gettysburg Battlefield was in 1951
                    when I was six years old. I still remember the tabletop map with the colored
                    lights. They built a new museum and that map is now gone, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I saw it just about a year or two ago.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>By about '51 where were you, was there a place where you stayed a good portion of
                    your childhood?</p>
                <p>CUSHING: Yes. We rented a house up on St. Louis Heights on the island of Oahu,
                    which looked down on Palolo Valley and also looked over Waikiki, Diamond Head
                    and Kaimuki. It had a view of that part of the city. My dad bought a house in
                    Manoa Valley in 1953 so I did most of first grade, all of second grade and part
                    of third grade at Aliiolani Elementary School in Kaimuki. After that I
                    transferred to Manoa Elementary School in Manoa Valley.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about your various memories of growing up as a
                        kid in Hawaii. What was it like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: We were staying at a temporary house on St. Louis Heights until we could
                    move into the rental and a bunch of kids approached and began speaking to me in
                    pidgin English and they asked if I were from the mainland. “You from mainland?”
                    I said, “No, I'm from Ithaca.” “Hey, you from mainland?” I said, “I just told
                    you, I'm from Ithaca. What's the matter with you people?”</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>So my parents said, “John, John. 'Mainland' means all of the United States so you
                    are from the mainland, so tell them you are from the mainland.” Gradually I
                    learned if I did not learn pidgin, I would not get beaten up regularly at school
                    for being a snob, so I learned how to speak pidgin.</p>
                <p>They had what they called the English standard schools there. My parents sent us
                    to public schools but there were certain schools where in order to be admitted,
                    the student had to be able to speak and understand standard English so they were
                    called 'English standard schools' and then at one point after the war when a lot
                    of the Nisei soldiers came back and got into the territorial legislature, they
                    said, “Oh, this is racist. We can't have that.” So they abolished that system
                    but I think my older sister was the last one to get into that system. The
                    quality was still fairly good, we went to schools that had only recently been
                    English standard schools so a lot of the better teachers were there. My parents
                    could have sent us to private schools but said it was better to go to a public
                    school because we would be associating with many different kinds of people as we
                    grew older so it was better to go to a public school and get accustomed to it.
                    There was a great deal of racial diversity; Japanese American, Chinese American,
                    Korean American, Filipino American and lots of Portuguese. Interestingly,
                    Portuguese were considered a separate group. You could have any number of
                    Europeans, especially from northern Europe who would all be termed 'haole,' and
                    as Paul Theroux noted, the world “haole' is seldom uttered without a
                    modifier.</p>
                <p>Gradually I figured out that if I spoke pidgin at school I would not get beaten
                    up regularly for being a snob, so I learned to speak pidgin.</p>
                <p>At the time pineapple and sugar were still dominant industries. The military was
                    also fairly important there during the Cold War. Tourism was just starting to
                    develop. When I was really small, there were really only five major hotels in
                    Waikiki and you could go down there on Sunday and find a place to park and go to
                    Waikiki Beach. Plenty of open space.</p>
                <p>The tourists all came over on one of the Matson Liners, either the Matsonia or
                    the Lurline, which was how we came over in '51, a four day voyage from San
                    Francisco. It kept a lot of the riff raff out because it would take 14 hours on
                    a propeller plane, so very few people came by plane. A couple of things that
                    really changed Hawaii were statehood and the Boeing 707, because once people
                    could come over on a jet, pretty much anybody could come over. Let's just say it
                    lowered the tone of the islands, according to the viewpoint of many people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a kid, how did you find elementary school?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>CUSHING: It was OK. I learned to read in kindergarten. I taught myself to read by
                    reading billboards and signs and menus and things. When I was a kid I used to
                    spread out the Ithaca Journal and crawl all over it reading it on the living
                    room floor. My grandmother was visiting once and said, “Isn't that cute? He's
                    pretending he can read the paper.” My dad said, “He's not pretending. He's
                    reading the paper.”</p>
                <p>When I got into first grade, Mrs. Hanes, the first grade teacher, sent a rather
                    curt note to my parents saying, “We prefer to teach the children how to read
                    using our own methodology and we do not appreciate the fact that you have
                    already taught your child to read.” My father wrote back a note that said, “We
                    didn't teach him. He taught himself.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a kid in elementary school, do you recall were there
                        any sort of books that you particularly enjoyed reading?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: We had a series of books called My Book House and they had different
                    fairy tales in them and we read a lot of Little Golden Books. We read The Little
                    Engine That Could and the Little Toot the Tugboat and my parents got us some
                    books by Holling Clancy Holling, who was a very good illustrator. Paddle to the
                    Sea was about this wooden canoe that went down the river from Canada. Pagoo was
                    about a hermit crab and Minn of the Mississippi was about a turtle and The Tree
                    in the Trail was about a cottonwood tree on the Santa Fe Trail and what happened
                    to it over many generations.</p>
                <p>My father also got a set of The World Book Encyclopedia so I would often pull
                    down a copy of the World Book and read an article that caught my attention and
                    it would say see also this or this so I'd put that volume back and get out
                    another volume and start reading that. So I sort of read my way through The
                    World Book Encyclopedias. I read some Jules Verne, read Tom Sawyer and
                    Huckleberry Finn. I guess that's pretty much it for the time I was pretty
                    small.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find school? Were you a good student? Were
                        there some subjects you had problems with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>CUSHING: When I transferred from Aliiolani to Manoa Elementary, they originally
                    put me in a mid-level third grade class and they gave me a book to read and I
                    read, at natural speed, “Wow. Look at Spot run. That dog surely can run fast.
                    Sally said, “Come back, Spot. You are running too fast.” And the kids would say,
                    “Slow down, slow down. We don't know what you are reading.” Then some other kid
                    would read, “Run, (pause) Spot, (pause) run. My, (pause) that (pause) dog
                    (pause) certainly (pause) can (pause) run (pause) fast.” So I was transferred to
                    the best third class but they had already formed their own clique going back to
                    kindergarten so I was a new white kid coming in, in the middle of the school
                    year as I recall. I had already developed a crush on this Portuguese girl name
                    Stephanie Teves who was in the original third grade class into which I was put
                    and the kids in the best third grade class were really mean. One day I wrote a
                    note to the teacher saying, “Everybody is mean to me in this particular class. I
                    want to go back to the class where I was before.” So I gave her the note and ran
                    away.</p>
                <p>The next day I was sent up to the principal's office and told to sit and wait but
                    I never actually saw the principal. I was then told I could go back to class, so
                    I presume that while I was away the teacher told all the other kids in the class
                    that they had to start to make more of an effort to bring me into the class and
                    stop being mean. Things gradually got smoothed over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a little about in these early times. Was this a
                        particularly Hawaiian neighborhood or was this a mixed neighborhood or
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Manoa Valley, no. The traditional Hawaiians had been decimated by
                    disease and had been pushed out to the fringes. They had public housing where a
                    number of Hawaiian or part Hawaiian families lived, but in that particular
                    neighborhood, one neighbor was Mrs. Randall and the other house was Mr. and Mrs.
                    Tavares. They were of Portuguese descent but he was a judge and very well
                    respected. There was Mrs. Randall, a divorced woman with two sons on the other
                    side and then Tim Togikawa, whose father, Japanese American, his father was an
                    optometrist. Below that was Mr. Carlson who was a veteran of the Navy in the
                    Second World War. It was mixed white and Asian American, Japanese and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>At the northern end of the valley, near the mountains, there were still truck
                    farmers. There were some Filipinos who would grow lettuce and vegetables and
                    things and bring them down to the markets. That is long gone but when I was
                    young, the paved road ended at Manoa Elementary School and that continued as a
                    dirt road for some several miles and there were lots of truck farms up there,
                    and some horse stables near the big Chinese Cemetery.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you fit in the class structure? Your father
                        working for the Institute, did this put him up a little higher up in the
                        pecking order or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>CUSHING: Yes, he eventually became a member of the Board of Regents of the
                    University of Hawaii and then was chairman of the Board of Regents. He was
                    active in the Hawaii Historical Society. I didn't know it at the time but the
                    house we bought in 1953 was built in 1910. It had very high ceilings and had
                    very nice architecture. It was originally built for a minister. It was a very
                    spacious house, a nice big yard with an elephant ear tree, monkey pod tree, a
                    mango tree, a papaya tree, breadfruit tree, hibiscus bushes, a couple of
                    plumeria trees. I didn't realize it at the time but I expect we were upper
                    middle class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You as a kid, there was a change. I grew up in the period
                        where when school was over, mother would say, “OK, we have dinner at such
                        and such a time and just go out and play and don't come back until 6:30” or
                        something like that and the other kids were doing the same.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: We did the same thing. After I had finally learned to ride a bike, I'd
                    just say, “I'm going up the valley” and just tool around here and there and
                    maybe stop in at one of the stores and read comic books or buy some bubble gum
                    or something. No, there wasn't anything, no strict supervision at all. It was
                    just like, they wanted to have a rough idea where we were but it was just like,
                    be back at this time. There was not a lot of nervousness about where kids
                    were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or the scheduling of Little League and that sort of
                        stuff.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Nothing like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then middle school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Junior high school, seventh, eighth and ninth, Robert Louis Stevenson
                    Junior High School.</p>
                <p>That school drew from various other elementary school districts so it was a
                    little bit tougher crowd because some of the other elementary schools that fed
                    that school came from Pauoa Valley which was kind of a slightly lower class,
                    kind of the farther west you got in Honolulu, the lower class the people were,
                    and there was a public housing settlement near the school. Pauoa Valley was to a
                    certain extent a Japanese American neighborhood but when you got west of
                    downtown, then you started to get a lot of Samoans and Portuguese and so forth.
                    The middle class Portuguese all went to St. Louis, which was a Catholic private
                    high school. So junior high school was a little bit tougher, yes.</p>
                <p>

                <p>CUSHING: I tried to keep a low profile, which was hard because I was the tallest
                    kid in the class. I stuck around with the kids from the same elementary school,
                    Manoa, and I was in the highest level of all the classes so as I recall, it was
                    neither pleasant nor unpleasant; I just kind of put in my time. I had a seventh
                    grade teacher whom I didn't like very much and unfortunately, I had her for
                    three periods of the day. My parents told me to stop talking back to her and
                    just do whatever she said. She was mean, she was a real bitch, but I
                    survived.</p>

                <p>CUSHING: I had a sister three years older, born in 1942 and a younger brother
                    born in 1947. My sister had her own room and then when she went away to college
                    I finally got to have that room. Even though it was a spacious house, the way it
                    was laid out, my brother and I had to share a room so we'd get into
                    disagreements about this and that. At one point my dad came in with a roll of
                    masking tape and he put a line of masking tape right down the middle of the room
                    and he said, “John, this is your half. You may cross Jim's half on your way to
                    your half but you may not linger there. Jim, put your stuff here. John, put your
                    stuff here. Leave each other's stuff alone.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a kid growing up how was family time? Did you sit
                        around and talk about things at the dinner table or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Yes, we all talked. My father subscribed to the Saturday Review and the
                    Reporter and Life and the Saturday Evening Post and so he would occasionally
                    bring an article to the dinner table and read it and we'd be asked to comment on
                    it. We talked about current events and things like that. My mother had a rule
                    that we could not talk about physiological functions at the dinner table and if
                    we strayed into that area she would say, “I thought we had an understanding that
                    physiology was not to be brought up at the dinner table.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did your family fit politically?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>CUSHING: I expect they probably voted for Eisenhower and I suspect my dad
                    probably voted for Nixon in 1960, not very enthusiastically. He just said he was
                    not quite as bad as Kennedy. My mom, whenever she came back from voting and I'd
                    say, “Who'd you vote for?” She'd say, “None of your business.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about religion? How religious was your family or was
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: We started out going to Central Union Congregational Church and my
                    sister finished up there through high school mostly because she had friends
                    there but when the Unitarian Church came to the Islands and was established, we
                    gravitated to the Unitarian Church although my mother lost her faith when she
                    was on the verge of death back in 1951. She lost a fourth child due to eclampsia
                    and the doctor asked my dad what do you want to do? If we abort this fetus that
                    is almost full term, we might save your wife. If we wait we are probably going
                    to lose them both, so she survived but later had epilepsy related to the
                    eclampsia. I asked her about religion and she said, “Well, at the time that I
                    was pretty sure I was going to die, I found religion to be of no comfort
                    whatsoever.” My father was a rationalist and so he had no belief in God or an
                    afterlife as far as I can tell. They went to church mostly because there were a
                    lot like minded people there who were either extremely liberal Unitarians or
                    agnostics who went there for the intellectual discussion and friendship and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember the definition of a Unitarian is they believe
                        in one god at most.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>We are moving up through the end of junior high. Were there any other sort of
                    forces playing on you and your family at the time, either in Hawaii or interests
                    or news?</p>
                <p>CUSHING: I guess statehood was a big deal in 1959. They let us all out of school
                    early when Congress voted to admit Hawaii as a state and had celebrations and
                    this, that and the other because prior to that, if I had a pen pal from the
                    mainland, he would write, “Do you live in a grass hut? Do you dance the hula? Do
                    you have cars? How is it that you are able to write to me in English?” Often I
                    would send away a coupon from a comic book for the flash Gordon decoder ring or
                    the Buck Rogers ray gun or something and it would come back and say, “We do not
                    accept orders from outside the continental United States.” They would bounce it
                    back. It was Honolulu, TH, Territory of Hawaii. We had no representative to
                    Congress, I guess we had a delegate to Congress but he couldn't vote or say much
                    of anything. It was sort of a feeling of second class citizenship that statehood
                    helped to alleviate. Statehood was a big deal. Other than that, I honestly can't
                    recall.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you pick up any feeling at the time towards the
                        Japanese American because they were the one major, rather large group,
                        weren't they? They were distinct in a way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How stood things that you picked up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: The Nisei veterans that came back from war got into politics. They kind
                    of got a lock on the teaching profession. They got into the educational
                    administration so large numbers of the women became elementary school
                    teachers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Parallel to the New York Jewish experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I guess. They really did get a lock on it. There were a few, very few,
                    haoles and a few Chinese Americans but a large number of the teachers were
                    Japanese American. They were middle class. The barbers were all Japanese
                    American women. They ran these small noodle shops. There is a type of noodle
                    called saimin which is very popular there. There used to be a lot of little
                    neighborhood restaurants that would serve saimin and barbecued beef or pork and
                    macaroni salad, rice, the typical Hawaiian lunch.</p>
                <p>They got into politics, they got into legislature. I think after statehood our
                    first senators were Hiram Fong who was Chinese, and war veteran Daniel
                    Inouye.</p>
                <p>The Chinese were a smaller group but I think were generally considered to be more
                    astute at business, more aggressive, tighter family structure and so forth but
                    the Japanese Americans were seen as middle class strivers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the American missionaries a group that had any power
                        by that time or was that pretty much over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: No, that was done. I guess their descendants have done pretty well.
                    There was a fellow named Bishop who married a Hawaiian princess and got a huge
                    parcel of land, Bishop Estate. The income from those lands funded a school. It
                    said in the bequeathal, “a school for the children of Hawaii,” so there's this
                    big discussion of what it meant, who the children of Hawaii were and so I think
                    you had to be of at least one quarter Hawaiian by blood to go there. The
                    Kamehameha School was private schools for children of at least partial Hawaiian
                    ancestry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One hears a lot about Punahou. Was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>CUSHING: Punahou, which President Obama attended, was the arch rival of Roosevelt
                    High School. It began as a school for missionaries' kids, I guess. I was in a
                    rather anomalous position at Roosevelt because there were very few white kids in
                    the public schools who were not military, who were from local families, “local”
                    being a term for established in the islands, although actually local often means
                    not haole. Local could mean Samoan or Portuguese or Hawaiian.</p>
                <p>At any rate, Punahou was virtually all white kids unless someone was a very
                    gifted athlete, at which point he would be poached from whatever other school he
                    went to and given an athletic scholarship. Their football team and their other
                    sports teams had kids of all different ethnicities but the regular student body
                    was pretty much white.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to high school where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I went to Theodore Roosevelt High School which was about six blocks west
                    of Punahou.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went there for a full four years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Junior high school was seventh, eighth and ninth so I did tenth,
                    eleventh and twelfth grades there. We had compulsory ROTC in tenth and eleventh
                    grade. We had to wear a uniform and drill every Tuesday and have a parade. Once
                    a month we had a dress parade and we had to wear a long sleeved khaki shirt with
                    a black tie and creased khaki pants and our shoes had to be spit shined and our
                    brass buckle and collar tabs had to be shined. If we loosened our tie or
                    loosened our collar during any one of the classes during the day, the teachers
                    were required to report us to the ROTC instructors and we would get demerits. If
                    we got a certain number of demerits, we could not pass the class and if you had
                    not passed two years of ROTC, you couldn't graduate. We were taught either by
                    veterans of the Pacific War or the Korean War and we learned how to drill, we
                    learned the manual of arms, using M-1 Garand rifles, with no firing pins and we
                    watched old training films from the Second World War on bayonet fighting and
                    tactical maneuvering and all sorts of stuff like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did many of the kids go into the military?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>CUSHING: They did go into the army, just about the time of the Vietnam War, yes.
                    Hawaii was quite pro military. I think there was the stigma of, potential
                    disloyalty because Pearl Harbor happened there. There were so many Japanese
                    Americans that they could not be interned or anything although a number of them
                    were arrested and interrogated and so forth. But of course, they had the 442nd
                    regiment and the 100th battalion that served with distinction in the European
                    Theater. It was pro military in the abstract, but at the same time the white
                    soldiers, sailors and Marines from the Marine Airbase could not get a date to
                    save their lives because all of the local families said, “You will not under any
                    circumstances date a white, military person from the mainland. You simply will
                    not do this.” White servicemen were looked upon with disdain but in the
                    abstract, Hawaii was pro military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had three years of high school. What subjects were you
                        particularly concentrating on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I had the first year of Latin in ninth grade. I had second year Latin in
                    tenth grade and also started French. I went to summer school the summer of 1960
                    before tenth grade to take world history so I could take French and Latin at the
                    same time. I had first year algebra in ninth grade. Algebra, geometry, physics
                    and chemistry, I didn't do particularly well in. I had difficulty with them. I
                    always did well in English, French, Latin, and history. In the summer school
                    American history class in 1961 I'd take an exam, I'd get it back and if
                    something were marked wrong, I'd go up to the teacher's desk and argue the point
                    that she had not considered this and that and she would change my grade. I was
                    not very good in math and science. I passed them but not with any flying
                    colors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about extracurricular activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Ran track and cross country.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was sort of the spirit getting towards the end of
                        high school? Get the hell out of Hawaii, see the rest of the world or how
                        did you feel about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I was a little bit apprehensive. I was kind of reluctant to apply to
                    schools up on the mainland. I thought, “Gee, I don't know. It's awfully big.
                    Maybe I'll just go to the University of Hawaii” but my parents empathically said
                    no. The University of Hawaii is a second rate school. You are not going to go
                    there so I eventually applied to Reed College and was accepted there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I was originally a little apprehensive about leaving but as an ultimatum
                    my folks said, “You will go to school up on the mainland. You are not going to
                    stick around here.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One thing you haven't mentioned at all. You are on this
                        island. What about surfing and swimming and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I enjoyed skin diving at Hanauma Bay; before it became a protected wild
                    life resort you could go and spear fish if you wanted to and you could pitch a
                    tent on the beach, go out and spear a fish and then cook it up on a wood fire or
                    charcoal fire for dinner. We used to picnic on the beach. My father had a little
                    charcoal stove called a hibachi and so we would grill up something for a picnic
                    lunch or picnic dinner. I didn't do a lot of big board surfing but I did a lot
                    of body board surfing with a short board, a board about two thirds the length of
                    this table.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at Reed from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I was at Reed from September, '63 to May of '67 and in the summers I
                    came back and worked in a pineapple cannery.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about Reed. This was '63 to '67? Was either of
                        two movements going around sort of the rebellion of youth and free speech?
                        Was that taking root? And then the Vietnam War. Were those movements going
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Not initially, no. The first big shock was when John Kennedy was
                    assassinated in November of '63. I was just a couple of months into my freshman
                    year. The free speech movement, I guess started at Berkeley in '64 but Reed
                    already had a tradition of open academic inquiry and so forth. All behavior at
                    Reed between faculty and students was based on what they called the honor
                    principle which as the typical honor system; you wouldn't cheat on an exam, you
                    wouldn't lie, you wouldn't steal. Don't lie, don't cheat, don't steal and also
                    part of the honor system was you were not to say or do anything that offended
                    anyone else. If someone else felt offended he could go to the honor board and
                    bring an honor case against you and this would be heard and either upheld or
                    dismissed. I never served on the honor board.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>I had one honor case brought against me along with about 400 other people because
                    the day the old commons closed down, there was an enormous food fight. They
                    decided that to celebrate the closing of the commons, there would be a food
                    fight and so everybody who didn't want to be in the food fight ate early because
                    commons was open from 4:30 until 6:00, but sometime between 5:30 and 6:00,
                    people started throwing food. I was working in the dish room at the time so from
                    the dish room I was spraying people with the dishwashing hose. Other people were
                    spooning mayonnaise from the salad bar on people and one fellow was shooting
                    milk out of a cardboard milk dispenser. So it was an unholy mess and then at the
                    end of it, we began cleaning up. We got out mops and brooms and things but the
                    manager of the commons came and screamed at all of us to get out. She had it
                    professionally cleaned and somehow got the names of all 400 people that had been
                    involved in the food fight and we were all listed as honor violators and were
                    assessed $3.00 each toward the cost of the professional cleaning. That was my
                    one violation there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Reed, it has a reputation of high academic standards.
                        Did you find that you were sort of in a different league?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Oh, yes. It didn't take long before I concluded that I had been admitted
                    by mistake. The first year was humanities. We started out with the Odyssey and
                    went through Plato and Aristotle and Lucretius and Seneca and on into
                    Christianity and so forth. And then we went from the Enlightenment to
                    Shakespeare and Milton and just all the way on up through Sartre so I guess so
                    we had a very comprehensive survey of western civilization, starting form Homer
                    and going all the way through the 20th Century. We had humanities lectures three
                    days a week and we had conferences a couple of days a week also, small group
                    conferences and very combative discussions about the material. We had to write
                    numerous papers also, humanities papers on a certain topic. It was extremely
                    rigorous. I had humanities, I had beginning French and I had biology and I had a
                    music course, history of music.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So many universities and colleges had sort of a Marxist
                        tinge to some of the courses. Was that at Reed at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: No, there were a lot of red diaper babies from the big cities in the
                    East, Jewish kids whose parents had been what they called 'parlor pinks' so
                    there was a lot of Marxist mindset among the students there but I don't think it
                    seeped into the curriculum all that much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Cold War? How much were you getting? Was
                        the Cold War something of consideration while you were at Reed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>CUSHING: No, the main thing I remember about that was the Cuban missile crisis in
                    October of '62 when we were seniors in high school. That was a big deal. Reed
                    existed in sort of an intellectual bubble. There was a lot of work on civil
                    rights a bit later. The summer between my freshman and sophomore years the
                    Student Non Violent Coordinating Committee was active; a lot of the students
                    went down to Mississippi in the summer of '64 to register voters and we did a
                    lot of marching for civil rights and meetings and rallies and so forth. We
                    marched against the McCarran Act in the spring of '64. Everybody worked very
                    enthusiastically for Lyndon Johnson's election in November of '64 because the
                    alternative was Goldwater but then within a few months they were condemning him
                    for escalating the war in Vietnam.</p>
                <p>I think there were three people on the entire campus who were Republicans and
                    they would have Goldwater bumper stickers on their bicycles and their bicycles
                    would be vandalized because they had Goldwater stickers on them. It was pretty
                    much faux left wing. I don't think there was much thought behind it; it was sort
                    of the default position to be what was considered liberal just because it was
                    socially unacceptable to be much of anything else.</p>
                <p>The Vietnam War became a big topic from the fall of '64 the Gulf of Tonkin
                    Resolution and so forth, right after Johnson was elected and then all the rest
                    of the time I was there, there were demonstrations against the Vietnam War;
                    marches and teach-ins and things like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you looking at studies in any particular area of the
                        world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I majored in English and French literature and as part of Humanities 110
                    and 210, we studied European civilization and history and then I took a couple
                    of courses in American intellectual history so we started with the Puritans and
                    worked our way all the way through Emerson, Thoreau, but it was more
                    intellectual history than political or sociological history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were at Reed, did the Foreign Service ever come
                        across your radar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: No, not in the slightest. I knew that Dean Rusk was the secretary of
                    state. When I was a kid I knew that John Foster Dulles was the secretary of
                    state and then he died of cancer and Christian Herter was the secretary of
                    state. No, not in the slightest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you pointed towards? Professor like your

                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I had no idea. I joined the Peace Corps out of college because I had no
                    idea what I wanted to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the dating habits, practices at Reed in that
                        era?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Folk dancing was big I guess because a lot of the kids were Jewish.
                    Israeli folk dancing was really big. They would have folk dances in the student
                    union and play all these records and there was homebrew; some people brewed
                    homebrew.</p>
                <p>The dorms had visiting hours. I think on week nights between 4:30 and 7:30 guys
                    and girls could go into each other's dorm rooms. During the weekend I think it
                    was from 2 pm to 9 pm or something. There were dorm mothers that sort of kept an
                    eye on the upper class women.</p>
                <p>Years later I learned at a reunion that the girls would make these charts on
                    butcher paper with markers about who had slept with whom and like how everybody
                    was related in terms of with whom they had had sexual relations and so forth. I
                    was either studying or listening to blues records or playing touch football.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you graduated in '67?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Joined the Peace Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What made you do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Didn't want to go to graduate school. I was exhausted. I had a very long
                    year writing my senior thesis and I also played in a rock band when I was at
                    Reed. We used to play at dances at the student union and sometimes we'd play
                    gigs downtown Portland also.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What instrument?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I played the harmonica and tambourine, sometimes the upright piano,
                    sometimes a rhythm guitar.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the draft status? What was the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>CUSHING: I was 2-S and then at one point they had this rule that in order to keep
                    your 2-S status you had to pass an intelligence exam and I and a number of other
                    people decided that was classist because only upper class kids would be able to
                    pass the intelligence exam to maintain our student deferment so instead of
                    taking the exam, in protest I went over to another college where they were
                    giving the exam and attempted to hand out very turgid and poorly written
                    propaganda material that someone had given us and the people to whom we handed
                    it out ripped it up and threw it at us because they had taken the exam very
                    seriously. Yes, it was a student deferment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you go into the Peace Corps without getting
                        drafted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I had just started Peace Corps training in the summer of 1967 when I got
                    a notice to report for my pre-induction physical but the Peace Corps wrote a
                    letter to them and said this fellow is already in Peace Corps so they gave me a
                    deferral for Peace Corps service and then, by the end of my second year in Peace
                    Corps they had instituted the lottery and my number was 331 and they never got
                    to that number so I was fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Peace Corps; when you signed up for it could you name
                        where you wanted to go or how did it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Somebody actually came to the Reed campus and gave the Modern Language
                    Aptitude Test. Because I had a high score, they sent me a pack of material
                    asking me if I wanted to go to South Korea and I said, “Yeah, sure” so I did. We
                    trained at this ski resort up in Pennsylvania, Blue Knob. Trained from July of
                    '67 to early October and then went off to Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Korea from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I was in Korea from October 13th, 1967 to about July 30th of 1970. I
                    extended for a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go in Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I was in the town of Wonju which was southeast of Seoul, about 80 miles
                    or so. It was just at the beginning of a fairly extensive mountain range that
                    ran down the entire spine of the peninsula.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>CUSHING: I was teaching English at a junior high school. I taught English classes
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Korea and the Koreans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Very cold, freezing winters. The Koreans were quite interested in the
                    United States. I think there was some residual bitterness about the fact they
                    had been divided and the war and so forth but also there was gratitude that the
                    United States had saved them from being entirely communized. They were very
                    ambivalent, very ambivalent but I lived with a very nice family. The husband was
                    a teacher at the same school where I was and he rented me a separate little
                    one-room house.</p>
                <p>I almost died of carbon monoxide poisoning after I had been there a little while.
                    I bought a charcoal burning stove to keep the place a little warmer than the
                    ondol floor but one night I went out to a Chinese restaurant with a bunch of
                    other teachers and drank a whole bunch of pegal, very strong alcohol, came back
                    and left the stove on all night as usual and about 2 in the morning had a
                    splitting headache so I pushed open the door and pushed my head out of the door
                    and through to the courtyard and decided this is kind of nice, this cold air so
                    I think I will just leave my head out here in the cold air and then next morning
                    took apart the stove and found out the pipe had been completely gunked up so if
                    I had not awoken with a splitting headache, and had not pushed my head outside,
                    I would have probably just expired from the carbon monoxide.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That killed a lot of people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: It did, about 2,000 people a year died because of cracks in the ondol
                    floors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the educational system there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Very rigorous. Education was in high demand. The junior highs had an
                    entrance exam and not everyone got in. The kids all wore black uniforms, student
                    uniforms, sort of military style, modeled after the Japanese school uniform with
                    the caps. In the summer they wore lighter trousers and a white short sleeved
                    shirt. They were not allowed to do anything except go to school and go home and
                    study. They were not allowed into movie theaters while wearing their uniforms
                    unless it was a school approved movie. Then they could all go. It was a very
                    rigid hierarchy. The principal was sort of the god of the school and the vice
                    principal was the enforcer and then there was a department chairman for
                    mathematics and social studies and English and so forth.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>I recall they had a specific class in anti-Communism at the time. They taught
                    anti-Communism as a subject and they would have anti-Communist speech contests
                    and anti-Communist poster contests and anti-Communist essay contests and any
                    number of things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for Park Chung Hee and his rule
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: The thing about Park Chung Hee was what I encountered later with the
                    Shah of Iran; hang the photograph of him on your wall and don't bring him up at
                    all. Make sure you have his photograph prominently displayed somewhere and don't
                    talk about him. Just do not talk about him, period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a period where they were making quite an effort
                        to allow people coming from more agricultural communities which I assume
                        yours was, to benefit whereas so often governments will make the farmers
                        bring their produce in and give them a low rate so let the city populace
                        have cheap bread and Park Chung Hee was not doing that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: No. I think he wanted Korea to work toward self sufficiency in
                    agriculture. Actually the first family I lived with, the father took an
                    examination and was able to get a position in Seoul, so I lived with them from
                    October to about January of '68 and they moved away to Seoul so then I lived in
                    sort of a boarding house from February to about July and then in July of '68 I
                    moved to a farming village about five miles outside out of town. I lived with
                    Korean farmers in a mud walled, thatch roofed farmhouse. We got water from the
                    well, had no electricity. It was a very interesting way to live. All the food
                    came from the farm. They had rice fields, they had vegetable gardens. We had
                    kimchi and tofu and in the summer we had corn and potatoes and fresh vegetables.
                    It was excellent food.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about kimchi?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Oh, I liked it, still like it.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>We had a conference up in Seoul in January of '68 and about two days prior to the
                    seizure of the Pueblo a team of North Korean commandos came down to assassinate
                    Park Chung Hee. I happened to be hiking on the same mountain ridge as these 31
                    North Korean commandos so I was hiking along and was on my way back down when
                    this ROK helicopter came by at a very low level bristling with guns and they
                    motioned for me to go back up to the top of the ridge so I did. They had rounded
                    up all the hikers and had them all in a group surrounded by these gun packing
                    soldiers and they screened each person and they saw that I was obviously an
                    American so they said, “Get off the mountain.” I said, “Sir. That's exactly what
                    I am going to do. Goodbye,” and I left. That night we were at Academy House in
                    Su Yu Li, which was on the outskirts of Seoul at the time and there was a gun
                    battle in the mountains up above so we all got up on the roof and watched the
                    tracers and the flares and the mortar rounds and what not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Korea, they had a curfew every night.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: They did. It was a good excuse to stop drinking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was consul general there from '76 to '79 and we loved
                        the curfew because it meant our kids had to be home and we didn't have to
                        stay too long at parties.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Exactly. There's always this big scramble about 11:30 at night.
                    Everybody's jamming to get into a taxicab and the cab driver would say, “I can't
                    take you, it's too far. I can't get back to my garage before curfew.” Sometimes
                    the hardcore drinkers would just sleep under the tables at the bars.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find teaching?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: It was good. The kids were very diligent. There were an awful lot of
                    them. They didn't light the stove until November 1 and they took the stove out
                    on March 15th. It got plenty cold before November 1st and it was still pretty
                    cold after March 15th. I would wear long underwear and a wool shirt and sweater
                    just to try to keep warm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you teaching only boys or girls?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I was at Wonju Middle School from '67 to '69, which was a boys' middle
                    school and then I did one more year at a small Catholic school that was
                    coeducational. It was about 45 boys in a class and 15 girls. They sat the girls
                    up front so the boys wouldn't pester them, I guess.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know this from Seoul. The students would come to class
                        and then they would, particularly by the time they got around to high school
                        and then they would be expected to go home and study for another three or
                        four hours with their parents helping them. They didn't fool around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: That was pretty much it. Once kids got out of school, it was take your
                    books and go home and study. Some of the teachers made extra money by doing
                    private tutoring at night. They would go to different kid's houses and study,
                    help them study.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much social life with your fellow
                        teachers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I'd go out drinking from time to time. I wasn't much of a drinker. I
                    would go out and drink with them from time to time but sometimes we'd go on
                    hikes together. We'd have a school hike. On Arbor Day all the kids would have to
                    go up in the mountains and plant a tree. During school vacations I did a lot of
                    traveling around on my own. I liked to just get on a bus and go; the roads were
                    almost all dirt and the buses were converted army trucks. They just hammered
                    some sheet metal over the bed of an army truck and threw in some benches and
                    that would be a bus. The trains were very slow but that was pretty much the only
                    way around, by train or very primitive bus. The road from Seoul to Chunchon was
                    paved because it was considered a military road and from Chunchon to Wonju it
                    was paved. From Wonju to Seoul through Yeoju was all dirt and everything south
                    of Seoul was all dirt and east of Wonju was dirt.</p>
                <p>It is kind of ironic because now, because of the traffic jams if you are on a bus
                    trying to get back to Seoul on Sunday night it can take you five hours. I would
                    be telling the younger people in Wonju, “You know, when I was your age, it would
                    take you five hours to get from Wonju to Seoul on a bus.” They'd say, “Yes, it
                    still takes five hours on a bus.” If the highway is clear it is about an hour
                    and twenty minutes.</p>
                <p>In the summer of '68 one of my students had an older brother who was a Buddhist
                    monk so he asked if I would like to travel around with him. So in the summer of
                    '68 this Buddhist monk and I traveled to a whole bunch of different temples all
                    over Korea and stayed at temples, which was nice. Traveled with him on the train
                    and bus and went to He In Sa, which is where they have all the woodblock prints
                    that we saw, went to temples in Chinju and in Masan and Pusan, a number of
                    places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>CUSHING: They tried to keep a very strict wall between Peace Crops and the
                    embassy, although every time a new Peace Corps group arrived, the North Korean
                    radio would say, “Another group of nefarious American spies has just landed in
                    occupied Korea” and then they'd read all our names, so somehow the North Koreans
                    got a list of all the names of the Peace Corps volunteers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you at all interested in the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: We'd go to the USOM (US Overseas Mission) cafeteria, which was near
                    Kyung Bok Palace. It used to be the Overseas Mission; it is now the embassy
                    building. We'd go to the cafeteria because we could get grilled cheese
                    sandwiches and hamburgers there.</p>
                <p>I took the Foreign Service exam for the first time in the cafeteria of the U.S.
                    Overseas Mission in late 1969, I believe. One of the other Peace Corps
                    volunteers had already been accepted into the Foreign Service and got a deferral
                    to do Peace Corps for a couple of years before he went in.</p>
                <p>From my Peace Corps group there were five who went in, I think before me. There
                    is Leroy Norton who eventually ended up in economics and the Foreign Commercial
                    Service, mostly in Australia and New Zealand. Doug McNeal, Leroy Norton, Russ
                    Sveda, Mark Mohr and Dick Christenson. I joined considerably later than
                    everybody else. Mark had already gotten in in '67 but he didn't have actually
                    start until '69. Dick got in I think in '73, Doug McNeal maybe in '70 or '71 and
                    Leroy Norton about that time too and Russ Sveda probably not much later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Korean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: The language?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I wasn't a particularly good student during the training but once,
                    especially once I was out living on the farm and there was nobody for miles who
                    spoke English, my Korean got quite a bit better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find sort of the class structure of Korean, you
                        use a different form depending on whom you are talking to. I suppose in a
                        farm community you don't get involved in as many of the you might say, the
                        niceties, did you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: No, they just spoke low form the whole time.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>One of the things that was extremely striking was that virtually all the young
                    men were in uniform and carrying a weapon so it was not uncommon to be riding on
                    a bus with a soldier who was carrying an M-1 rifle or an M-1 carbine or
                    something. The same thing with the train; they had their weapons and helmets
                    with them at all times. I guess it was standard procedure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They took the whole thing very seriously and rightly so.
                        This was not a minor exercise.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Following the assassination attempt on Park Chung Hee the Pueblo was
                    seized two days later and then in either late '68 or early '69 there were 120
                    North Korean commandos landed on the east coast and it took months to hunt all
                    of them down. As a matter of fact, they originally estimated they had 120
                    commandos but they ended up with more than 120 bodies because if they caught a
                    South Korean out after curfew, they would shoot him and count him as one of the
                    commandos.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Koreans are rough.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Yes. The other thing they had was the Ye Bi Gun, which was sort of like
                    National Guard, composed of army veterans. They had these uniforms and they'd
                    keep all the carbines locked up at the police station or the local armory or
                    something and if there were a rumor of a spy or guerrillas in the mountains or
                    something, they'd call out the Ye Bi Gun from that village and arm them and send
                    them all up into the hills.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any news or was there much talk about the
                        Korean division in Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: We were told not to talk about that. Occasionally we would go to a bar
                    and we would meet a Korean soldier who had served in Vietnam. They would talk a
                    little bit about it. They would talk about how much tougher the Korean soldiers
                    were than the Americans, how it took more bullets to kill a Korean than an
                    American and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Koreans had quite a reputation in Vietnam for not
                        taking any crap. I think the Viet Cong particularly left them alone.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Pretty much, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What had inspired you to take the Foreign Service
                        exam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>CUSHING: One of the people I roomed with during Peace Corps training had already
                    taken the Foreign Service exam and had been admitted. That was Mark Mohr and I
                    thought, well, living overseas here in Korea is pretty interesting and if I were
                    to get into the Foreign Service eventually I would be able to live in lots of
                    different countries and learn different languages and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you got out in '69, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I extended until July of '70.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Then I got a master's of arts in teaching form the School for
                    International Training in Brattleboro, Vermont. It was an offshoot of the
                    Experiment in International Living so I did a one year's master's program which
                    included a home stay and teaching in Mexico. At that point I learned
                    Spanish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Compare and contrast Mexico and Korea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Mexico was a little more laid back. The thing I noticed there was they
                    had a very balanced view of how much you should work and how much you should
                    relax. Korea was striving to catch up or to, well, at first just to rebuild from
                    the war, I suppose. It was a very hard scrabble society when I was there in
                    Peace Corps so I guess the central unit was the family and you know, maybe your
                    classmates or something but essentially it was every man for himself. You had to
                    work really hard. You had to study hard. The farmers worked hard, the people in
                    the factories worked hard, the soldiers trained hard. There is something about
                    having a cold winter that keeps your mind focused on your work whereas in
                    Mexico, they were nice people. They were pretty laid back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was your school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I did a home stay in San Luis Potosi and then I taught for a couple of
                    months in Orizaba. San Luis Potosi is north of Mexico City. Orizaba is southeast
                    of Mexico City, between Puebla and Veracruz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the students?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>CUSHING: Pretty good. I was teaching at a private academy, an English academy so
                    the students were all motivated to study. They had all paid their own money to
                    go and study there. It was OK.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing with the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Well, at that point I passed the written exam and I eventually ended up
                    coming down to Rosslyn, I think it was January of '71 and I failed the oral. At
                    that time it wasn't the group exercise. It was just one guy with a board of
                    inquisitors and they asked me a whole bunch of stuff. I didn't know very much of
                    it and so at the end of it there was one guy sitting there who said, “I am
                    astounded at how poorly you did” and then he left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any of the questions?</hi>

                <p>CUSHING: It was January, 1971. They said, “Name the major geopolitical trouble
                    spots of the next decade.” And they asked how I thought the war in Vietnam was
                    going and that's pretty much all I remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that turn you off?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Well, shoot. I didn't pass the oral. I put it out of my mind, I guess. I
                    took it again, took the written in December of '73 in Tokyo and I passed it but
                    I never got around to taking the orals because I would have had to go back to
                    the States. I was living in Japan and working then. I took it Tehran in the fall
                    of '75 and I missed passing the written exam by one point. I failed by one
                    point. There was one question. There was a photograph of an urn and it said, is
                    this a Greek, Roman or Etruscan urn? I guessed wrong so I failed the written by
                    one point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get yourself to these various places? What did
                        you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: After I got my master's of arts in teaching which included a home stay
                    and practice teaching in Mexico, I went to work for a private English school in
                    Japan in Chiba, which is kind of around the peninsula from Tokyo. Chiba is a
                    port city and it has refineries and steel and this, that and the other, sort of
                    industrial commercial city. It's all part of a big urban belt that goes all the
                    way from Kawasaki to Tokyo and around to Chiba.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>I lived in a little farming village. The director of one of the schools where I
                    worked had a daughter who was married to the son of the village postmaster and
                    they lived in the house connected to the post office in the village and they had
                    an empty house up on the hill that was 350 years old, an enormous house with a
                    thatched roof and tatami mats. He asked if I would be interested in renting that
                    so I had an enormous old farmhouse that had about five or six large rooms to it.
                    It had a crank telephone, had a well, and had a wood burning bathtub.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did you do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I was there from August of '71 to about August of '74.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the school like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: There actually were a couple of schools. There was one building in
                    Inage, which was sort of a little suburb of Chiba, and then two stops down the
                    rail line there was a rented space in a commercial building that had and office
                    and a classroom and then on the next floor it had another classroom, so there
                    were about three or four teachers there.</p>
                <p>The students were mostly adults. They'd come in and study in the evening so the
                    working hours were from 6 to 9 at night so you had the rest of the day off, not
                    too shabby. I spent a lot of time during the day either reading or riding my
                    motorcycle around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was your Japanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Knowing Korean made it a lot easier to learn Japanese because the
                    grammatical structure was quite similar and all the loan words from Chinese were
                    exactly the same. You just had to learn how they pronounced them differently. Of
                    course, in Japanese the Chinese character would also be used as the base of the
                    verb but all the compound nouns and compound verbs were exactly the same. If one
                    knew, especially if you knew the Chinese characters in Korean for the compound
                    nouns and verbs that were loan words from Chinese, it was pretty easy to plug in
                    the Japanese. I had a tutor. I'd stay after from 9 to 10 a couple of nights a
                    week. I would study with a tutor in the office of the school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you received by the Japanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>CUSHING: Whenever possible they tend to just politely ignore foreigners, pretend
                    they aren't there. I got to know the folks in the village a bit. There was just
                    one little store there and one little gasoline station with two pumps so I'd
                    fill up the motorcycle there. There was a little general store that sold basic
                    groceries and so forth, a very old, pre-war building and there was a barbershop
                    and one little restaurant and a fish monger, the guy sold fish and that was it.
                    They were OK. I didn't get to know a great number of Japanese people actually at
                    the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel you were having an interesting time but were
                        you going anywhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: One of fellow teachers was from my Peace Corps group, Korea III. He
                    taught at the main school up in Tokyo and so I met one of his students and
                    married her in the spring of 1973 and then our son was born very late in 1973.
                    There was a fellow who had been there at the Inage school who was pushing 40. He
                    said, “I've got to get out of here because otherwise I will be an English
                    conversation teacher in Japan for the rest of my life” and there are people who
                    do that. He said, “I've got to get out and do something else” so after our son
                    was born, I also thought I really cannot stick around here forever. For one year
                    I found work at a school in New Mexico. I taught in a Navajo community school.
                    It was not a BIA school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bureau of Indian Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Right. It was not a Bureau of Indian Affairs school. It wasn't on the
                    reservation. It was on Navajo land but it was a community school. The school
                    board was all parents of the kids and so we were there for a year and then went
                    off to Iran to work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the background of your wife?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: She came from a small town in the Japan Alps called Omachi. She had come
                    to Tokyo to study English and she worked in a large night club as a pager. She
                    was in charge of paging all the different hostesses when the customers came in
                    so she had to memorize the call numbers of all the different hostesses. When a
                    particular customer came in and wanted Cherry Blossom or Chrysanthemum or Rose
                    or Peach Tree or whatever, she would have to page that person. Go to table five
                    because your customer is here. She was a pager and a receptionist and during the
                    day she studied English. So I met her that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Tehran from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>CUSHING: I wasn't in Tehran; I was up in Rasht. I did a year at the Navajo school
                    from August of '74 to July of '75. That was extremely isolated and very
                    difficult for my wife, a very difficult introduction to the United States and so
                    we heard that the School for International Training had a contract to teach the
                    Iranian navy. This is rather convoluted. The Shah of Iran had bought these four
                    Fletcher class destroyers from the U.S. Navy and in order for the Iranian crews
                    to be trained to run them, they had to know English. The Shah, never doing
                    anything halfway decided that every new recruit in the navy would learn English.
                    So there was a navy language school in Rasht.</p>
                <p>So the U.S. navy got the contract and then subcontracted it to the U.S. Army and
                    the U.S. Army subcontracted it to the Defense Language Institute and the Defense
                    Language Institute subcontracted it to the School for International
                    Training.</p>
                <p>So I heard about that and I signed up and we got accepted so we went off to Iran.
                    After some ridiculous training at the Defense Language Institute at Lackland Air
                    Force Base in San Antonio, which was compulsory so we just suffered through that
                    as best we could. I did get to see the Alamo anyway.</p>
                <p>Then we were over in Rasht, Iran which is not too far from the Caspian Sea.
                    That's where the main navy language school was.</p>
                <p>The Shah had this idea you should teach every single kid coming into the navy
                    English for three months, find the best students, send them to another school,
                    up in Bandar Pahlavi (as it was called then) which was up the coast and then the
                    best of those would be sent to Lackland Air Force Base near San Antonio Texas to
                    take advanced language training, after which he would have enough crews to run
                    the four destroyers and they would all know English and then they would be
                    trained. So that was his idea. He never did anything halfway.</p>
                <p>A similar story was he decided that every child in Iran should have a glass of
                    milk once a day so he bought this enormous herd of cows from New Zealand. His
                    advisors said, “Why don't we buy ten cows and bring them to Iran and see how
                    they do?” He said, “No, no. Every kid in Iran needs to have a glass of milk once
                    a day” so he bought these thousands of milk cows and they all died. He said,
                    “These cows are no good. I'm not paying for them.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were teaching navy people from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: From August of '75 to the end of July, '77.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from this? You certainly had enough
                        experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>CUSHING: It was interesting to live in Iran. We traveled a bit, saw Isfahan, saw
                    the ruins of Persepolis near Shiraz. It was quite interesting, actually.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were getting very close to the revolution there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up any indicators of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Yes. Three contractors in Tehran were killed by the mujaheddin.
                    Actually, earlier I think they tried to kill the deputy chief of mission at the
                    embassy. He was supposed to go somewhere but he didn't feel well so he sent an
                    Iranian employee in his place so the Iranian got killed. Up in Rasht the police
                    raided a house of a terrorist cell and got into a big gun battle with them and
                    captured a number of them.</p>
                <p>Also there was a hotel in Iran where we used to go to the lobby to drink beer and
                    play chess. I wasn't there at the time but a terrorist came to the door with a
                    hand grenade. He was going to throw it into the lobby but there was an off duty
                    policeman who shot him just as he pulled the pin so the fellow dropped the
                    primed grenade after being shot and blew himself up.</p>
                <p>One of the Iranian teachers at the school was buying a pair of shoes and had just
                    come out with this new pair of shoes and there was a gun fight right in front of
                    the shoe store so as he was coming out of the door, this dead terrorist fell
                    into his arms. So yes, things were popping.</p>
                <p>The big riots in Tabriz began in March of '78 and we were already out of there by
                    then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left in '77 did you have the feeling you wanted
                        to get the hell out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I thought two years was enough. The School for International Training
                    contract ran only the first year and then there was a different group of sort of
                    fly by nighters who took over the contract for the second year and they left, so
                    it was going to be very extremely haphazardly run and I was going to be under
                    the direct supervision of an extremely obnoxious and arrogant Iranian navy
                    admiral, Admiral Faroktollah, and I thought, “I don't want to do this.” He was a
                    real shmuck. The Iranians tend to be very whiny and defensive and feel
                    persecuted. I didn't want to be any part of that so I left.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>They actually asked me to stay. They liked the work I was doing. I was a teacher
                    the first year and then I was director the second year so I scheduled all the
                    classes, assigned the teachers, supervised the exams, sent in the reports to the
                    navy headquarters and so forth. They liked the work I was doing and they asked
                    if I would stay but then this particular admiral said, “God damn it. Who asked
                    Cushing to stay?” I was on my way out by then and I thought, no, I don't want to
                    work for this guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what did you do? This is '77?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: In '77 I got a job in the Tacoma public schools teaching in the
                    bilingual education program. The friend who had introduced me to my wife in
                    Japan had done a two year program in the writer's program at the University of
                    Iowa and then ended up in Tacoma and then was the coordinator of the bilingual
                    education program for southeastern Asian refugees. So we taught Vietnamese,
                    Cambodian, Laotian refugee kids. He got me a position with the Tacoma public
                    schools. So I did that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you work it when you get all these kids from
                        Southeast Asia? Was there a common language you could start with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: We hired adult refugees who spoke English and Vietnamese or Cambodian or
                    Laotian. One of the fellows I worked with was in the Vietnamese air force as a
                    helicopter pilot. His English was pretty good. He was one of the
                    paraprofessionals.</p>
                <p>For the older kids we had a welcome center for kids I guess between the ages of
                    15 and 21 so we would start out with classes mostly in their languages and would
                    gradually transition them into the regular mainstream curriculum.</p>
                <p>The smaller kids they put them in the regular classroom a lot of the day and they
                    picked up English pretty fast but we would have some classes with them during
                    the day also.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Foreign Service, was it still out there as an
                        option?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>CUSHING: Sort of. What happened was I worked from '77 to '82 as a teacher and
                    then the coordinator of the program, my Peace Corps friend, went off to work at
                    the American International School in Lagos, Nigeria and so I became the acting
                    coordinator while he was away. I did that for three years and I got involved in
                    a very messy lawsuit. There was an extremely arrogant, incompetent,
                    Latvian-American teacher who had been bounced out of the German department. He
                    was teaching German but at the request of many parents, he was bounced out of
                    there and so they sloughed him off into the bilingual program. I attempted to
                    have him non-renewed for non performance. An arbitrator ruled that he was
                    entitled to keep his job and so he then sued me for the intentional infliction
                    of emotional distress. The Tacoma school board and I were codefendants in that.
                    That trial lasted for months and months. They tried to buy out his contract and
                    get him to drop the suit and so forth.</p>
                <p>Eventually, the jury awarded him $20,000 but concluded that because he had been
                    uncooperative during the probation process, he was entitled only to 50% of that.
                    They had offered him as much as $500,000 to walk away but he ended up with
                    $10,000.</p>
                <p>My favorite part was that the two attorneys on his side had made less that month
                    than I did because they got one third of it, they got $3,333 which they had to
                    split. But that left a bad taste in my mouth.</p>
                <p>I was back in the classroom because I was in the bad graces of Tacoma Public
                    Schools, and was getting tired of what I had been doing and so my friend said,
                    “Why don't you take the Foreign Service exam again?” So I thought, why not?</p>
                <p>So I went up to Seattle to Pacific University in December of '86, took the
                    written exam. It was a Saturday, no heat in the building. It was about 50
                    degrees, took the written exam, and passed it. Took the oral up in Seattle in
                    May of '87, did the background check and medical and then early December of '87
                    got a call asking if I wanted to be in an A-100 class that would be forming up
                    in February of 1988 so I said, “Sure.” So I had to get the house organized, get
                    the house ready to rent, pull our son out of school, quit my job, find homes for
                    the cats, get the dog ready to go to Washington with us, gave away most of our
                    furniture, sold the cars. All of this within the space of six weeks. It was a
                    real crash program.</p>
                <p>I got the news on December 5th. I had been out each time they called. The
                    classroom had a phone but I had been elsewhere each time they called so finally
                    about the third time they left a number, so I called the number back and a
                    secretary at FSI who said, “Well, we were about ready to give up on you because
                    you never answered the calls but would you like to be part of an A-100 class
                    forming in February?” I said, “Sure.”</p>
                <p>So my wife quit her job, we gave away the cats, go the house ready to rent, sold
                    the cars, gave away the furniture, shipped a few things to Washington and away
                    we went.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John, you say you have a couple of things you remembered
                        about the oral and the written exam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Yes. I took the written exam up in Seattle in December of 1986 at
                    Seattle Pacific University in an unheated room. It was on a Saturday and the
                    university turned the heat off for the weekend. It was about 50 degrees in
                    there. I did the written exam as quickly as I could and I finished with about an
                    hour to spare and walked up to the proctor to hand it in and she said, “You
                    can't leave yet. There's still an hour left.” I said, “Take it, I'm freezing,
                    goodbye” and I walked out.</p>
                <p>Well, I guess they graded it because I passed it and I got a notice to appear for
                    the oral exam in May of 1987 and so I arrived, I believe it was at a hotel up in
                    Seattle where they had set aside some rooms and there were two other young men
                    and I and three women.</p>
                <p>Prior to the exam I went to Nordstrom's and bought a very expensive tie and I
                    took a suit up and wore it the morning of the exam. I was staying at a friend's
                    house the night before the exam so I could get there fairly early. His wife saw
                    me that morning wearing a suit and the expensive necktie and I had shined my
                    shoes and she said, “You are going to pass the exam.” I thought that was nice of
                    her to say so I showed up at the exam and one of the other men had corduroy
                    trousers and loafers and a tweed sport jacket and the other young man had a pair
                    of blue jeans and a short sleeved shirt and a sweater vest and a leather jacket.
                    The young women all had fairly informal clothes on too. I thought, “ I guess I
                    am a little bit ahead of the game.”</p>
                <p>I passed the oral exam. I assume it was because I was the only person who showed
                    up dressed appropriately. I think they thought well, we need one person out of
                    Seattle. Let's pick the guy who was wearing the suit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember any of the questions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: We had that inbox exercise. One of the fellows said OK, how is it we are
                    running a current account deficit when we have a big trade deficit with Japan?
                    The deficit with Japan was more than with China at that time. That was 1987 but
                    inflation was not really that bad. So I cobbled together some sort of half baked
                    explanation for that and we had the inbox exercise where you are in this
                    provincial town where the consul general has just died of yellow fever so you
                    have one hour to go through the inbox and write recommendations before the plane
                    back to the capital leaves.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>I did the inbox exercise and then we had the negotiation exercise and I
                    volunteered to be the note taker for that and do the final report so I guess
                    that got me extra points. I did notice that on a scale of one to ten, what they
                    now call my emotional intelligence or EQ was 2.7, in other words willingness to
                    notice other people's views and take them into account so that was probably the
                    thing I scored lowest on. I scored fairly high on writing ability and
                    articulateness and so forth.</p>
                <p>One of the questions for American citizen services was well, you are in a town in
                    Mexico and an elderly American woman has not paid her bill in several months and
                    the owner of the hotel is going to evict her on the street but she insists that
                    her Social Security check will be arriving any day now. What do you tell the
                    owner of the hotel? So we had that question. That's pretty much all I
                    remember.</p>
                <p>They asked a question about trends in American literature in the 1980s and so I
                    discussed Raymond Carver and minimalism and things like that. I think the main
                    thing that got me through was shining my shoes and getting a good necktie and
                    putting on a suit.</p>
                <p>I got a notice that I passed the oral and then I did medical examinations and
                    background check and filled in this enormous form and then heard nothing until
                    early December of '87. I was working in a large high school. There was a phone
                    in the classroom but I kept missing calls there because I was also teaching
                    classes in other rooms in the building. They kept saying, “Well, you got this
                    call and they said they'd call back.” Then the next day, “Somebody called and
                    said they'd call back.” So finally I said, “Look, when they call will you get
                    the number?”</p>
                <p>I called that number from home and I called about 7 in the morning from Tacoma so
                    it was already 10 in Washington, DC and they said, “We are forming an A-100
                    class that begins February 1st of 1988. Are you interested?” I said, “Sure, I'll
                    be there.”</p>
                <p>It was early December so I had less than two months. I got the house ready to
                    rent, I quit my job, I found homes for the cats, gave away most of our
                    furniture, sold two cars. I had a great deal of work done on the house to make
                    it ready to rent and then I found a rental agent. We pulled our son out of
                    school and my wife quit her job and January 22nd of 1988 we got on a plane and
                    came to Washington, DC.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>It was a big change. It was quite stressful for our son because he had been
                    living in Tacoma from kindergarten all the way through the start of eighth grade
                    but I was really looking forward to leaving the Tacoma public schools. They had
                    treated me very shabbily so it gave me great satisfaction to sign my resignation
                    letter. We stayed over in Rosslyn for a while and then found an apartment near
                    the Woodley Park metro stop We got there about a week early to take care of
                    various things so I took my son to Alice Deal Junior High School and enrolled
                    him in a Washington, DC public school and he did reasonably well. He brought
                    home his English textbook, this was in 1988 and I noticed that it was the same
                    textbook and the same edition that I had used in junior high school in Honolulu,
                    Hawaii in about 1960. At any rate, he was there for only half a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem with the Tacoma high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I had been an administrator for the bilingual education program for
                    three years. I was the acting coordinator while the coordinator was off in
                    Lagos, Nigeria at the international school and I got the district embroiled in a
                    nasty lawsuit because I attempted to have one of the teachers in the program
                    fired from the district for incompetence. He had previously been a German
                    teacher and then so many parents of students had complained that he was foisted
                    off onto the bilingual program. He was a very rigid, arrogant, dogmatic person
                    and he was spending most of his time in the teachers' lounge smoking cigarettes
                    and drinking coffee while he left the class up to a Cambodian paraprofessional.
                    Things came to a head. I tried to have him dismissed but the standard procedure
                    in a school district is to write up a good evaluation for a teacher and then
                    just transfer him to another school if he's a problem and so that is what had
                    been happening to this fellow.</p>
                <p>He retained his job. There was an arbitrator from the government who said that
                    there were not grounds for his dismissal and he in turn sued the Tacoma public
                    school district and me for the intentional infliction of emotional distress. So
                    I became a pariah in the district. They sent me back down into the classroom.
                    They hired a totally incompetent person to be the new coordinator who was
                    constantly calling me on the telephone and asking me what to do. I thought,
                    well, this is pretty shabby. I think I have had enough of that so that was one
                    of my motivations for taking the Foreign Service exam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your A-100 class. Could you sort of characterize it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>CUSHING: There were only two people in the class older than I was; I was almost
                    43 when I went in and there were a lot of people in their 20s, maybe a few in
                    their early 30s. I didn't socialize with them a great deal mostly because I was
                    had a wife and child already and was older than most of them. It was pretty
                    good. I was very excited to be in an entering class. I don't remember a great
                    deal about the exercises now except that it was exciting, it was stressful on my
                    family. We put our son into a new school. I took placement exams in French,
                    Spanish, Japanese, Korean and Persian and I do recall that even in A-100, people
                    were playing favorites. We had this off site exercise down at Harper's Ferry in
                    a hotel and there was an imaginary crisis involving a mythical country called Al
                    Jazeera and they had two separate groups. Two separate American embassies, one
                    here and one there and they named a person to be the Deputy Chief of Mission,
                    there were retired ambassadors serving as ambassadors for the role play but they
                    named this very attractive woman to be the Deputy Chief of Mission and I was a
                    low-level officer, did some interviews with people playing the natives and
                    discovered what the cause of the crisis was and how to solve it but the woman
                    playing the DCM did not have time to meet with me. I said, “Hey, I've got the
                    answer here.” She said, “No, I'm busy. I'm in a meeting. Don't bother me.”</p>
                <p>So I thought, “Well, I wonder if the real Foreign Service is going to be like
                    this.” I finally said, “Listen, I would really like you to listen to me” and she
                    said, “Stop interrupting me. I am serious” and she began screaming. I thought,
                    “Well, is this what real work will be like?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was one of the, as they call it, professionals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: She was a member of our class also. The two ambassadors were real
                    retired ambassadors who were there for the role play and everyone else had been
                    appointed so they said, “OK, you are now the DCM” and I was just a lowly junior
                    officer but the crisis involved demanding payment for a debt and reducing the
                    subsidies on flour and gas, which is exactly what happened in Egypt. I said,
                    “Listen, I know what the answer is here” but she would not listen to me. We were
                    in a group meeting and so I said, “Listen, I have something really important”
                    and she said, “Shut up. I haven't got time for you.” So I thought, “Well,
                    OK.”</p>
                <p>She was posted to a consulate in New Zealand and even New Zealanders complained
                    about her behavior and attitude when she was working in the consular section.
                    She eventually married a New Zealander and dropped out of the Foreign Service.
                    That was the end of that. I was a little bit disillusioned by that.</p>
                <p>It was sort of the end game of the Cold War. Reagan and Gorbachev. Gorbachev came
                    to Washington, DC and there was a great deal of excitement. There was a boom in
                    Soviet things. The Secret Service and the Soviet guards were trading pins and
                    there was a great deal of excitement about that.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>My first assignment was Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic in the consular
                    section. So I then took the ConGen course and my scores in that were 91, 95 and
                    98. I think they had a section on passports and citizenship and they had one on
                    immigrant and non-immigrant visas and one on American citizen services. My
                    average was just short of 95 for those courses so I did reasonably well in
                    those.</p>
                <p>We had come to Washington in late December or late January of '88 and just before
                    July 4th we flew off to the Dominican Republic. I had done the A-100 class and
                    the ConGen course and a little bit of area studies and Spanish and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say you were in your 40s when you took the A-100 and
                        many of the class were in their 20s or early 30s. Did you get the feeling
                        from taking and all that you were coming that you were going to be because
                        of the time factor somewhat limited in where you could have all the fun in
                        the Foreign Service but you were are unlikely to reach significant rank or
                        something? Was that almost a given?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I assumed that. I never had any expectation that I was going to rise
                    very high. For one thing, except for the Dominican Republic, every supervisor I
                    had was quite a bit younger than I was and so I was not in a position to get a
                    mentor of any kind. No matter where I was, there was often a certain level of I
                    don't know if you would call it discomfort but I was always older than my
                    supervisors and in many cases, more articulate or more intelligent or a better
                    writer or something but I just tried to downplay that. It made for some limited
                    expectations; I knew I wasn't going to rise very high and I didn't much care
                    because it was such a relief to get out of my dead-end job in the Tacoma public
                    schools and to get into something where I would have an opportunity to travel. I
                    thought, well, this is already my second career so it's really not that
                    important.</p>
                <p>So we got to the Dominican Republic. We took our dog along. It was a very high
                    stress environment in terms of visas because there were long lines, lots of
                    people, and lots of interviews every day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in the Dominican Republic? You were
                        there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I was there from July of '88 to January of '90.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what was the situation in the Dominican Republic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: The president was Joaquin Balaguer of the Social Christian
                    Democrats.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was pretty old, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Balaguer was in the government under Trujillo, who was killed in '61 and
                    then Balaguer was out of the country for a while and then he came back. He and
                    his rival Juan Bosch were both extremely old. Balaguer must have been in his
                    late 70s or early 80s by then and completely blind. The joke was he never knew
                    when the electricity went out because he was blind.</p>
                <p>It was definitely a third world country. What I thought was at the time the
                    electricity went out all the time because there was a great deal of corruption
                    in the electric company and there were problems with the union. The union at
                    night would come and cut down the transformers from the poles and sell them for
                    scrap metal and so there were constant brownouts and blackouts. We would have
                    two or three hours of electricity a day. Of course, with no stop lights the
                    traffic was constantly in chaos. There was always gridlock because when you came
                    to an intersection that had stoplights, each person assumed that well, if there
                    had been electricity, I would have had the green light so they'd just get all
                    jammed up together.</p>
                <p>I never really expressed this to anybody there but I thought either get the
                    electricity squared away or just throw all these computers and air conditioners
                    into the sea because they are worthless. You pretend you are this modern society
                    with computers and television stations and air conditioning and so forth but you
                    never have any electricity so you might as well go back to spearing fish and
                    living in grass huts.</p>
                <p>We had four auto accidents there just because the driving was so bad. Sometimes
                    the water was off.</p>
                <p>We started off renting a house and it turned out to be a big mistake. It was
                    extremely noisy and very stressful because of the noise and also at one point we
                    had hired a maid and an intruder came over the wall with an ice pick while none
                    of us were there and raped the maid by holding an ice pick in her ear and
                    saying, “I will have my way with you or I will stab you in the ear with my ice
                    pick.” That was extremely unpleasant.</p>
                <p>We were in this house, especially my wife really not liking it. She liked it a
                    lot at the beginning and then it was noisy, noisy, noisy so eventually, in
                    January of '89 we were able to move to an apartment and were at the back side of
                    the building away from traffic so that was quite a bit better. That was an
                    improvement although the apartment had a generator but it could run only the
                    elevators and a few lights in the hallways in the stairs so people would get a
                    long extension cord and plug it in to one of the outlets in the hallway where
                    there was electricity and try to run things off of that. We had a very small
                    generator that could run the freezer.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>I remember once watching the football game on city power and it was a very
                    dramatic end to the game and there was a hail Mary pass and the quarterback
                    threw and it was in the air and then poof, nothing. Everything went dead. By the
                    time I got the generator on, the announcer said, “Wow. That was the most amazing
                    play I've ever seen.”The filter for the swimming pool would only run on city
                    power. The generators did not have the capacity to run the filter so the pool
                    would get green and slimy. When the water was off, my shower in the morning
                    would be to go down to the pool with a bar of soap and a plastic garbage can and
                    just get a plastic garbage can of this slimy water and douse it over myself and
                    get soaped up and then put another plastic bucket of slimy water over myself and
                    then towel off and then take a smaller bucket of slimy water upstairs to shave
                    with in the dark. I'd often come into work kind of cut up and people would say,
                    “What happened to you? And I'd say, “A cold water shave in the dark. What do you
                    expect?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I had pretty good supervisors. I started out with immigrant visas and I
                    did immigrant visas for a while. They were remodeling the consulate at the time.
                    First we had a little cubicle or office and people came in, right into the
                    consulate and saw us and we had a stack of cases on our desk and we'd do those
                    and we had no time off for lunch so I'd just take in a can of tuna and some
                    crackers and eat the tuna and crackers while I was working. We didn't have a
                    lunch break; it was a very high volume place.</p>
                <p>There was a considerable amount of fraud; a woman would say she'd have, so many
                    children, she would claim people on her immigrant visa who were not hers, there
                    would be one baby born in say, September of '69 and then there would be another
                    kid born in March of '70 and then another kid born in January of '71 or
                    something. I'd say, “These can't possibly be all your children.” “No, look each
                    one is in a different year, look at that. '68, '69, '70. There's no problem
                    whatsoever. I don't know why you are bothering about this,” and so forth. We had
                    a lot of fake marriages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were they going? Mostly New York or was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Mostly to New York, some to Miami, some to New York. There would be an
                    entire package; there'd be phony wedding pictures and a phony marriage license
                    and we'd have all these cases where a 55 year old Puerto Rican woman came to the
                    Dominican Republic and fell in love with a 20 year old cab driver on the way
                    from the airport to the hotel and they got married three days later.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>I still remember one. This fellow claimed that his fianc�e, I guess his fianc�e
                    had a green card in the U.S. and was petitioning for him. I said, “Do you have
                    any letters that would show proof of a continuing relationship?” So he took a
                    letter off the top of the stack and handed it to me and it said, 'Jos�, I am
                    sending back the ring. Send me my clothes. I know what you have been doing. If I
                    ever see you again I am going to cut your heart out and feed it to you.'</p>
                <p>I said, “Wow. This doesn't look like she is ready to get married to you.” He
                    said, “Oh, can I see that letter? Uhh, women get emotional sometimes.”</p>
                <p>I tried to give people the benefit of the doubt. At one point there was a woman
                    who had a bunch of kids and there was one girl and I said, “This is a little
                    fishy here. Would you tell me what is going on?” And she said, “Well, listen.
                    This is our niece; both her parents were killed in a car crash when she was an
                    infant. We have raised her as our own child. We registered her as our own child.
                    She is not my biological daughter but I love her just the same as my regular
                    children.” I said, “Well, OK. Look, we'll include her in the visa package but
                    don't ever tell anybody else this.”</p>
                <p>We had one guy who was deaf, dumb and blind and tested positive for venereal
                    disease. Occasionally we'd get someone who was HIV positive and didn't know it.
                    I didn't want to be the one to tell him so I'd say, “Listen. We've got a little
                    problem with the process here. I think you need to go see your physician and
                    talk to him about this.”</p>
                <p>So the immigrant visas were fairly routine. They would try to fraudulently
                    include children. There would be fraudulent marriages and so forth.</p>
                <p>When I worked on non immigrant visas, I probably should have refused more people.
                    I had kind of a soft heart so other people were refusing nine out of ten and I
                    was refusing maybe six out of ten. I expect there are a lot of people who
                    overstayed their visas because I didn't want to turn them down.</p>
                <p>There was this one girl who needed medical treatment. She had a brain tumor. She
                    came in with a shaved head. I started looking at the papers and she burst out
                    crying. I said, “Que paso (What is it?)” She said, “No quiero morir (I don't
                    want to die).” So I said, “OK, if you stop crying by the time I count to ten,
                    I'll give you a visa.” So she did.</p>
                <p>There was a Haitian gentleman who was both a medical doctor and a minister and he
                    had a letter that he was going to a conference of Methodist ministers in
                    Illinois somewhere. I thought well, he looks like a high class gentleman. So I
                    gave him a visa and about three or four weeks later my supervisor called me
                    over. At that time we had no computerized name checks. We had microfiches with
                    names of people on a watch list but they were always months out of date. There
                    was no way to telephone from the Dominican Republic to Haiti. So I gave this
                    fellow a visa. I thought, medical doctor, minister going to a religious
                    conference in the U.S., fine.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>About four weeks later my supervisor called me to his office and he said, “Did
                    you give a visa to a Haitian named Roger Lafontant?” I said, “Yes.” He said,
                    “Oh. Well, he's the head of the Ton-ton Macoutes.” “Oh?” “He went to Miami,
                    bought a boatload of guns and came back and was involved in an aborted coup.” I
                    said, “Oh.” He said, “The next time you get a Haitian applicant, would you check
                    with me first?” I said, “Sure, I can do that.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For someone reading the Ton-ton Macoutes is the sort of
                        the mafia and enforcers of the Duvalier regime and all that, a pretty scary
                        bunch of guys.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: One time there was another Haitian there and I refused him so he reached
                    into a pocket and put a whole bunch of dust on the window. There was a window of
                    bulletproof glass and there was a little slot through which you could pass
                    documents. So he threw this whole bunch of dust down on his side and he cupped
                    up his hands and blew it, so this enormous cloud of powder came all over me and
                    he said, “You refused me for a visa. This is magic ju-ju dust and you are going
                    to die.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you are still here.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Yeah. So I dusted myself off and said, “Next.”</p>
                <p>We had a fellow who wanted to take his grandson to Disney World in Orlando and he
                    was a dentist. He had a couple of suitcases with him. I said, “How do I know
                    that you are a dentist?” He said, “Wait a minute.” He brought up one of the
                    valises to the window and opened it up and it was full of all the teeth that he
                    had pulled. I said, “Oh, OK. How do I know that you have enough money for your
                    trip to Disneyland?” He said, “Oh, wait a minute.” He opened up the other valise
                    and it was jammed with these wads of one and five dollar American dollar bills.
                    I said, “OK” and gave him a visa.</p>
                <p>Some of the younger guys were trading visas for the favors of young ladies. If
                    they saw an attractive young woman...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are talking about vice consuls.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sex has always been a big problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>CUSHING: Yes. I was married so I never got into that but what they'd do is they
                    would grant the visa and they'd leave their name card inside and say, “Let's
                    discuss your visa case further” or something. Sometimes they would append the
                    visa and say, “Well, we've got a couple of little details that need to be worked
                    out” and then they'd write their name and number on the card and slip it in the
                    passport.</p>
                <p>There was a woman once who said she'd like to meet me privately. I refused her
                    and she said, “I'd like to meet you privately to discuss this case” and I said,
                    “I don't think that would be appropriate, thank you.” I got a passport once with
                    a hundred dollar bill in it. When I flipped it open there was a U.S. hundred
                    dollar bill and so I immediately called the consular officer in the next booth.
                    I said, “Would you come over here, witness that this passport contains a hundred
                    dollar bill which I have not touched?” Then I called my supervisor over and
                    said, “My neighboring vice consul is willing to testify that this passport
                    contains a one hundred dollar bill that I have not touched.”</p>
                <p>The applicant was saying, “Oh, my goodness. How did that get in there? I must
                    have forgotten it when I was sorting through my papers.” So we gave him back his
                    hundred dollar bill and his passport and told him to get lost.</p>
                <p>There were a lot of fraudulent documents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a history of special investigations of vice
                        consuls or consuls who were selling visas there or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: We had one FSN, Foreign Service national, a very nice older woman who
                    every year bought another stretch of beachfront property up on the north coast
                    but apparently they could never pin anything on her.</p>
                <p>There was another woman from Puerto Rico who was a working spouse, PIT, part
                    time, intermediate, temporary or something who was selling visas but instead of
                    being prosecuted, she was just fired. Then she was hired by the Dominican
                    telephone company, interesting.</p>
                <p>I think there was some kind of investigation after I had left. I honestly don't
                    know what came of it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your ambassador while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Paul Taylor.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: He was a veteran of the navy and the embassy was quite a ways from the
                    consulate, about three or four blocks. I didn't see him often all that often but
                    I did hear a few stories.</p>
                <p>One of them was that one of the economic officers took a survey among embassy
                    people, are you satisfied with the provision of electricity? Everybody else said
                    no. We have to use the generator a lot and the electricity goes out a lot. The
                    problem with using the generator was it was very noisy and very smoky; it made a
                    big racket so a lot of people had them out in their yard in a little house. If
                    none of your neighbors had generators, you were the only guy there running a
                    generator so there were cases where people had a generator and if they turned it
                    on and none of their neighbors had any electricity there was bad feeling; in one
                    case the family had a swimming pool. The neighbors were in apartments all around
                    them they would throw garbage from their balcony into the guy's swimming pool to
                    express their discontent that he had a generator and they didn't.</p>
                <p>Getting back to the ambassador; they had a survey, are you satisfied with your
                    electricity or not? So the economic officer took it to the ambassador and said,
                    “Well, I've never had any problems with my electricity. I don't understand what
                    this is all about. So you are going to have to put me down as saying yes, I am
                    satisfied. I don't know why all these people are complaining like this. I always
                    have electricity.” So it was like 99% no, I am not satisfied and 1% which was
                    the ambassador, yes, I am satisfied with my electricity.</p>
                <p>A couple of other stories I heard; he had this Lincoln town car as his
                    ambassadorial vehicle and he had it repainted three times until it got to the
                    exact shade of midnight blue that he liked. He was dissatisfied that the
                    bookshelves in his library in the ambassador's residence were not level so he
                    would put a ball bearing on each shelf and see if it rolled one way or the other
                    and then ask the carpenters to reposition the bookshelves.</p>
                <p>At one point there was a town hall meeting. A lot of the embassy wives were
                    saying, “Well, we can't buy any meat because our freezers keep going off.
                    There's no electricity so we can't buy any meat because it will spoil and so the
                    ambassador's wife said, “Well, why don't you all come in and use the freezer at
                    the residence. You'd be welcome to label your meat and put it in there and why
                    don't we say every Wednesday from 1 to 3 you can either put meat in or take it
                    out.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much social contact with the Dominicans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: My wife got into a dance class with a very interesting fellow who was a
                    very good dancer and a very good teacher and so we met various dancers and
                    artists through him. So we did have some contact with Dominican people.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in what? 1990, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Yes.</p>
                <p>Actually, I have one more story from there.</p>
                <p>One other thing that happened was when we arrived in the Dominican Republic, our
                    air freight got sent to Dakar, Senegal and the administrative counselor, Lucille
                    Thomas, was not seized with any sense of urgency at all about that. We got there
                    with no air freight because it had been sent to Dakar, Senegal so it took us
                    another two months to get our air freight. She was not highly thought of, the
                    person, the administrative counselor there.</p>
                <p>I was bidding on my next post while in the Dominican Republic. This would have
                    been about June of 1989. I had lived in Japan so I already spoke Japanese and
                    had tested at 3-2, and there was a position open at the consulate in Osaka-Kobe
                    for a political-economic rotation so I bid on that and my career development
                    officer, CDO, called and said, “Well, things are looking pretty good” and then
                    she called and said, “Congratulations, you've been paneled.” So my wife who was
                    from Japan was very excited. She called up her mother in Japan and her family
                    and said, “Hey, guess what? Our next assignment will be in Japan” and everyone
                    is congratulating me.</p>
                <p>Then I got a TM-1, which was a cable form Tokyo saying 'Welcome to Embassy Tokyo'
                    and this, that and the other and then about three weeks later my career
                    development officer called me up and she said, “Well, it seems as if that
                    position in Osaka-Kobe was listed by mistake. There is already someone else in
                    the pipeline that is going there. Everything else that you bid on has already
                    been taken and Friday is my last day as your career development officer. Goodbye
                    and good luck.”</p>
                <p>So I was suddenly stuck. I had no onward assignment. We had already told my
                    wife's family that we were going to Japan and I was dumbstruck because I
                    thought, “Wow. This is so bizarre. I was told I was paneled, I got a TM-1 from
                    Tokyo and suddenly this thing is jerked away from me and no one ever gave me a
                    satisfactory explanation for what had happened.” I have no idea what happened
                    but it made me realize that the entire bidding system was rigged. If you didn't
                    know somebody, if you didn't have connections then it was entirely possible to
                    get screwed out of something even after you had been told that you had it. That
                    was a rather disillusioning experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>Fortunately, the DCM in Santo Domingo, a woman named Pat Langford, was very
                    sympathetic. She talked to the ambassador and she wrote a letter to Ed Perkins
                    who I think was director general at the time and explained what had happened. Ed
                    Perkins was apparently quite embarrassed by the whole thing so he sent down a
                    directive that I should get something fairly good and so they gave me The Hague
                    in the Netherlands as my second post.</p>
                <p>My wife was not very happy because she didn't like cold places. What she said
                    was, “Look, we are originally scheduled to rotate out of there in January. Why
                    don't we extend until June and bid on the summer cycle?” I said, “Look, if we go
                    to The Hague, I'll have language, we will be back on the summer cycle” so she
                    finally grudgingly accepted that.</p>
                <p>My new career development officer was Joe Ruth. There's also something in the
                    middle here. After I had gotten screwed out of the position in Osaka Kobe he
                    said, “Look, I understand what happened and we are going to try and make it
                    right for you. There's an economic position at the embassy in Tokyo. I will put
                    you in for that.” I said, “Well, OK. That's fine.” “That's really outrageous
                    what happened to you,” he said. We all feel very badly about it and we don't
                    know how it happened.” So I said, “OK, could you send me the position
                    description?” He said, “Oh, sure. I'll get right on that.”</p>
                <p>So weeks went by and I got no position description for the economic position in
                    Tokyo. Then I called up my new CDO and said, “What happened to the economic
                    position in Tokyo?” “Oh, somebody else got it.”</p>
                <p>By this time my deputy chief of mission, Pat Langford, and the ambassador had
                    both talked to Ed Perkins who apparently talked to my CDO and said “Get this
                    fellow something halfway decent” and so I got The Hague.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in The Hague from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I was there from the summer of 1990, got there just after Saddam Hussein
                    invaded Kuwait. Had a Dutch language course the first half of 1990. I finished a
                    24 week course in 19 weeks. I got a 3/3plus. We lived in an apartment in
                    Ballston so I'd walk down the hill to Rosslyn for my classes. I had Dutch
                    language from late January for about 19 weeks and then we eventually ended up in
                    The Hague in August.</p>
                <p>It was at the time of the first Iraq war. The ambassador was a political
                    appointee of George H. W. Bush who had donated $200,000 to his campaign. He was
                    53 years old, divorced with five children and spent most of his time dating 20
                    year old Dutch girls. He made his fortune in the pizza business. His parents,
                    when he graduated from Harvard had given him a bunch of Pizza Huts and he had
                    expanded those and so he was extremely wealthy and had been a generous donor to
                    the Bush campaign and so was made ambassador to the Netherlands.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>We got to The Hague during the time of the first Iraq war. The political section
                    had a political counselor, an external political officer, a pol/mil officer and
                    an internal political officer. It was way overstaffed. There was work for two
                    people and there were four people there so I had a very thin portfolio and very
                    little to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the political section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Yes, I was in the political section there. I did as much as I could. I
                    was in charge of overseeing Dutch relations with Suriname and the Dutch
                    Antilles. It was a fairly low profile thing and I wrote the human rights report
                    and went out and spoke to student groups and so forth.</p>
                <p>My first EER was</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the employee efficiency report.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: My first employee evaluation report was not very well done, although I
                    guess my boss thought it was OK, but I got a notice in October of '91 that I had
                    been denied tenure and was going to be given a fifth year. I called my CDO and
                    said, “What's going on there?” He said, “Well, you got very good employee
                    evaluation reports all the time you were in Santo Domingo. It talked about what
                    a diligent officer you were and how enthusiastic you were and so forth but it
                    did mention that you got really upset when you were screwed out of your position
                    in Osaka Kobe and then your employee efficiency report from The Hague was very
                    mediocre and so what it looks like, what the committee said was 'well, we can't
                    give this guy tenure because he started off like a rocket and then he leveled
                    off,' so if you had gotten a mediocre series of evaluations in the Dominican
                    Republic followed by a mediocre evaluation in the Hague, you would have gotten
                    tenure because they would have said, 'Well, here's a mediocre guy and he's still
                    mediocre and let's give him tenure' but because you showed so much potential in
                    the Dominican Republic and you did not realize it in the Hague, that's why they
                    denied you tenure.”</p>
                <p>I said, “OK, let me get this straight. If I had gotten nothing but mediocre
                    evaluations I would have been tenured by now but because I got excellent
                    evaluations in my first post and a mediocre evaluation in my second post, I am
                    now being denied tenure.”</p>
                <p>“Yes, that's right.”</p>
                <p>So here I am, 46 years old with a son about to go into college and I had been
                    denied tenure. That made a very stressful situation.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Coupled with that, between Santo Domingo and The Hague I got, I had talked to
                    Mark Minton, the deputy director of the Japan desk who said, “Well, I don't know
                    what happened to your assignment but if anything ever comes up, if I can ever be
                    of any help to you, just give me a call.” So I called him from The Hague because
                    the position in Osaka Kobe was becoming open again, I called him. He said, “Yes,
                    what can I do for you?” I said, “Well, I am calling about the position in Osaka
                    Kobe and he said, “Jesus Christ. We are in the middle of the Iraq war. We are
                    trying to get Japan to help pay for the war. They won't send any troops. I am
                    really busy. Who the hell do you think you are to be calling me like this?” He
                    screamed at me for about two minutes. And then he said, “If you want something,
                    send me a letter.” This is the same guy who had previously said, to call him if
                    he could be of any help, and I guess later I found out he was known as what they
                    call a 'screamer'. He had previously said, “Well, I am sorry stuff didn't work
                    out for you but if I can ever be of any help to you, give me a call.” So I
                    called him up and he screamed at me for wasting his time in the middle of the
                    Iraq war. Mark Minton. Now the ambassador to Mongolia.</p>
                <p>Virtually my entire second year in The Hague was kind of under a cloud. I could
                    not bid on another foreign post because I had been denied tenure and given a
                    fifth year. I thought it an extremely unpleasant saturation.</p>
                <p>So they shipped us back to Washington. Our son was about to leave for college, I
                    guess so we didn't have to worry about high school for him but for about the
                    first three months, September, October and November they had me in the ARA, the
                    American Republic Affairs front office as a staff assistant. The shifts were
                    from 6 in the morning until 3 in the afternoon, 7 in the morning until 5 in the
                    afternoon or 3 in the afternoon to about 11:30 at night. I had a chronic sinus
                    infection, couldn't shake it. Our son went off to college. Our dog that had been
                    with us for 12 years had to be euthanized a few days later because she had an
                    inoperable tumor, so suddenly our son was away and our dog had died and I still
                    had no idea whether I was going to get tenure or not.</p>
                <p>The fellow who was in charge of the front office at ARA, American Republic
                    Affairs said, “Well, look. This job is kind of too difficult for you” or “This
                    is no job for an old man” or something, so I got moved to Andean Affairs. Andean
                    Affairs included Venezuela, Columbia, Ecuador, Peru and Bolivia. At the
                    Department of State they have what are called 'Pullmans'. It was a formerly
                    normal sized office that had been cut in half to put in a corridor so it was a
                    very narrow office. I was down the hall from the regular room that had all the
                    other Andean Affairs offices in it. I sat in a Pullman with nothing to do for
                    two years. I just sat in the Pullman. Very occasionally if one of the desk
                    officers was traveling or was on leave, I would fill in there. I did my best to
                    get educated on everything that was happening. I was extremely underutilized so
                    essentially I would just sit in there and stare out the window at the park
                    across the street.</p>
                <p>My final review, I finally got tenure which was a great relief.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am surprised you got tenure because you say you didn't
                        really have a job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I got tenure based on my final evaluation from The Hague because my boss
                    in the political section was extremely defensive. My CDO sent something back and
                    said, “Well, the writing is flat. It is not a very good evaluation.” My boss in
                    The Hague got very defensive and said, “This is outrageous.” He made an effort
                    to write a very good evaluation for my final evaluation in The Hague so based on
                    that I squeaked through and got tenure. So after I was back in the U.S. with no
                    possibility of a foreign assignment, the head of Andean Affairs came and said,
                    “Well, John, I would just like you to know you finally got tenure.”</p>
                <p>So after that I sat in a Pullman, a very narrow office for two years with nothing
                    to do, just sat around there.</p>
                <p>After that I went to Guatemala. Guatemala was good. I was the labor attach� and
                    there was a very chaotic situation there. I worked on labor rights. Every now
                    and then the workers would occupy a farm or ranch and they would be shot up by
                    the army or the police or something. There were abductions of labor activists,
                    there were murders.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Guatemala. After getting up really early to catch the plane I arrived
                    totally exhausted on the first day and the ambassador said, “Oh, we have a
                    delegation here from USTR so I want you to come to this lunch.” I was totally
                    exhausted but she said, “You must come to this lunch,” so I started working the
                    first day. The ambassador...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Marilyn McAfee, a nice lady, very sharp. Marilyn McAfee had been in
                    Guatemala many years before with USIA and she was now the ambassador and so she
                    put me to work the very first day, which I thought, after two years of sitting
                    in a Pullman doing nothing, was good.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>I was extremely busy there. The assistant secretary of labor came down. I was in
                    charge of labor rights. I was not the human rights officer but I was the refugee
                    officer so I covered refugees returning from the insurgency who were being
                    resettled in various places in Guatemala. There was a massacre of returned
                    Guatemala refugees by an army patrol. I got very involved in that and I worked
                    with the UN High Commission for Refugees and also with MINUGUA, which is the
                    United Nations Verification Mission to Guatemala. I had a lot of work with them.
                    Every now and then a refugee would be killed in a camp and I would have to go
                    and investigate that. There was a great deal of pressure from human rights
                    groups, church groups, labor groups in the United States that had a knee jerk
                    reaction that because of the 1954 coup, anything that had happened since then in
                    Guatemala was the fault of the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the Arbenz coup.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: The coup where Jacobo Arbenz was thrown out. That was the United Fruit
                    Company coup, by John Foster and Allen Dulles.</p>
                <p>Once I got a human rights group down there and I gave them what I thought was an
                    objective assessment of the situation and one of them later wrote a letter to
                    the assistant secretary of the American Republic Affairs complaining that I was
                    unsympathetic to human rights concerns. I was obviously unqualified to be a
                    Foreign Service officer and I should be fired immediately.</p>
                <p>The other big thing down here was the Jennifer Harbury case. Jennifer Harbury
                    claimed she had married Eduardo who was a guerrilla in the insurrection and that
                    he had disappeared so she demanded since she was an American citizen and he was
                    her husband, she demanded that we help find him. We went around and around and
                    around with that.</p>
                <p>There was also Dianna Ortiz who claimed to have been abducted and tortured by the
                    Guatemalan military including being thrown in a pit with decaying bodies and all
                    this other stuff. There was never a dull moment down there.</p>
                <p>I was there for three years. It's a beautiful country. The only problems down
                    there were allergies and crime. Because it was the land of eternal spring, it
                    was the land of eternal pollen so I had a chronic series of ear infections and
                    sinus infections. Finally the doctor punched open my eardrum with a little
                    needle and he had a little vacuum cleaner and he sucked all the fluid out of
                    there and put in a drain, so I could blow smoke through my ear back when I used
                    to smoke.</p>
                <p>It was a beautiful country. I drove all over the country, went on a lot of back
                    roads, and had a really good time there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You alluded to a number of things but what was the basic
                        political situation at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>CUSHING: There was the democratically elected president, of Ramiro de Leon
                    Carpio. He was under a great deal of pressure from the military. The public
                    prosecutor's office was also kind of under the sway of the military so Myrna
                    Mack, an anthropologist who was working on human rights cases had been stabbed
                    to death not too long before and labor activists were taken away and beaten and
                    so forth.</p>
                <p>There was another case where there was a woman who claimed she had been abducted
                    and assaulted for her union activities but she turned out to be mentally ill.
                    There was a labor rights group in the United States that was pushing her case
                    and I found out that her stories were made up of whole cloth but I did not feel
                    like telling everybody, “Look, she's mentally ill and she has made all this up
                    and her husband is also mentally ill and they are both HIV positive. I have
                    checked her story and it doesn't add up.”</p>
                <p>Among other things that happened, one night she claimed that her son had been
                    kidnapped. Her son had disappeared so the legal attach�, who was an FBI agent,
                    he with a firearm and I with nothing went out to the toughest neighborhood in
                    Guatemala City and spent the entire night looking around, asking people if they
                    had seen this boy. It was one of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the whole
                    city. He turned up in the morning and claimed that he had been held and tied up
                    and this, that and the other but eventually it turned out he just spent the
                    night at a friend's house and had come back the next morning. So that whole
                    story was a fabrication too.</p>
                <p>This woman's claim to be persecuted was very thin but this labor rights group
                    from the U.S. with union officials and so forth came down and they said, “Why
                    are you not pursuing this more vigorously?” I knew already knew the entire
                    background of it and that it was all made up but I said, “Well, I am not able to
                    comment on that.” “You don't care. You just don't care. I'm going to go back and
                    tell everybody in my union the very poor service we are getting from the United
                    States Embassy.”</p>
                <p>I said, “I'm sorry. That's all I can do.”</p>
                <p>This woman was eventually granted asylum in the United States but was such a
                    difficult person that two or three different organizations asked her to leave.
                    She was in these group houses for refugees and they would throw her out.</p>
                <p>At any rate, Guatemala was a good post; interesting, a lot of work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I was there from the summer of '94 to the summer of '97.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any significant developments in the political
                        scene or was it sort of the same the whole time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: There was a peace accord signed in '96 so the different guerrilla
                    factions, which all combined probably numbered no more than 1,000 in different
                    parts of the country, eventually did sign a peace treaty. What they did was they
                    turned in their old weapons and kept their good weapons and became highway
                    robbers. Instead of holding up people for contributions to the insurrection,
                    they signed a peace treaty and kept their best weapons and they just became
                    gangs that held up people for their own personal profit. That was the level of
                    development there.</p>
                <p>In '97 we went off to Papua New Guinea, Port Moresby. That was a very tough
                    post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have heard that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: The thing about Port Moresby everywhere there was critical threat crime.
                    There were no safe parts of town. The Japanese ambassador was carjacked in the
                    driveway of his own residence. The wife of the New Zealand high commissioner was
                    driving and someone dropped a chunk of concrete off an overpass, shattered the
                    windshield so she got an eyeful of broken glass. There was a fellow about to go
                    into the Australian high commission and they had this little keypad that you had
                    to punch the code for the gate to open so he rolled down his window and was
                    punching in the code and somebody jumped out of a bush with a machete and
                    chopped his arm off and then hauled him out of the car and drove away in the
                    car. Gang rape was a big problem.</p>
                <p>At any rate, we did not do well there at all. My wife had problems with herniated
                    discs and so we went down to Brisbane for consultations. She decided not to have
                    surgery and she came back and eventually it got so bad she couldn't walk so we
                    went back and had surgery for the herniated discs.</p>
                <p>The one good thing about the time in Papua New Guinea was that we did have one
                    trip to Guadalcanal and Vanuatu so I was able to visit the battlefields of
                    Guadalcanal and also drive around in Vanuatu. That was very nice.</p>
                <p>We got there in August of '97. In June of '98 my wife was attacked by a gang of
                    bandits. I never sufficiently impressed on her the need to have the windows
                    rolled up and the air conditioner on. She hated air conditioning so she would
                    drive with the windows down and no air conditioning. She was coming back from
                    dropping off a Japanese friend at her (the friend's) apartment. She was coming
                    back to our compound which was on top of a hill. Every time I took the turn off
                    the main road to the road leading to our compound, I would take the turn very
                    fast and drive very fast and I never apparently impressed on her the necessity
                    of driving fast.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>She came upon a roadblock and they had these gangs of what they called 'rascals'
                    who are people who make their living by crime. They have no skills and there's
                    no work so they make their living by robbing people. Often they are sent from
                    villages in the mountains. If there is a young man in the village that is
                    creating problems, they will take up a collection and buy him a one way plane
                    ticket; an airplane plane was the only way out, a one way plane ticket to Port
                    Moresby and say, “Don't come back.” So you get the dregs of the whole island
                    ending up in Port Moresby. They find people who speak their same language which
                    is called “wontok”, one talk. They will live in a group house and they will all
                    pay part of the rent but they are responsible for getting their own food so they
                    live by crime.</p>
                <p>They had put up a roadblock and my wife saw this roadblock and a fellow standing
                    in the middle of the road and didn't know quite what to do so she slowed down
                    and then she thought well, I might get abducted and raped so then she thought
                    she would try to drive through the roadblock and had the windows down and so
                    this fellow smashed her on the head with a big rock, fractured her skull so she
                    was driving the car while unconscious. She rolled it up the side of the hill and
                    then it rolled. So after the car stopped rolling they reached in and took her
                    purse and radio and so forth.</p>
                <p>She was able to climb out of the demolished car and start staggering up the hill.
                    There was another housing compound where there people who worked for a bank.
                    There was a young man there who worked for the bank so he and his wife took her
                    into their apartment and got her cleaned up a little bit and then took her to a
                    clinic and then our deputy chief of mission decided that she should be medically
                    evacuated to Brisbane. She was put on an air ambulance to Brisbane that same
                    day. Her blood pressure when they put her on the plane was 82 over 50 because
                    she had lost so much blood.</p>
                <p>They put her on this air ambulance. There was someone else who had been injured
                    in an automobile accident so he was on the same flight. She was in the hospital
                    in Brisbane for about two weeks. Her face got all swollen up and she had
                    internal bleeding in the brain and she had a fractured skull and as a result of
                    the brain injury caused by the rock, she lost a significant part of her hearing.
                    She had 10% hearing in one ear and maybe 40% hearing in the other because of
                    brain damage from the rock. I concluded we were not going to serve out our tour
                    in Port Moresby. She needed specialized attention so I told the ambassador we
                    were going to curtail and we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Arma Jane Karaer, a very nice woman.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>Another thing that happened in Port Moresby was the consular officer got sick so
                    he was down in Australia for several months so in addition to doing the
                    political stuff, I also was doing consular. I'd do consular half day and then do
                    political.</p>
                <p>One extremely interesting experience I had in Papua New Guinea was when I
                    accompanied a U.S. army team, CILHI, they are based in Hawaii and their mission
                    is to recover the remains of war dead. They concentrated on Vietnam but if they
                    had a little extra time, they'd try to get remains out of Korea, North Korea and
                    if they still had a little extra time and money, they would look for World War
                    II remains. The pressure from families was all from the Vietnam people, the
                    missing from Vietnam but occasionally they'd do World War II so they came
                    down.</p>
                <p>I went with them to some very remote crash sites. We had records of a bomber that
                    had crashed on top of a mountain; a B-24 bomber so we hiked to that. We hiked
                    about waist deep in a stream for about two hours and then we climbed up a cliff
                    for two hours and the natives in the area had all decided to serve as guides so
                    everybody in the village turned out because they all wanted to get their $20 a
                    day for being a guide and so they said, “When we get to the crash site, we will
                    bang on something so you can hear the noise and you will know which part of the
                    cliff to climb.” Of course, they were much faster than we were. So we are
                    climbing the cliff and we hear bang, bang, bang, bang. We get there and this guy
                    has got a metal rod and he's banging on a live 500 pound bomb with this piece of
                    metal. So we said, “OK, you can stop banging.”</p>
                <p>So we went through there and there were also a couple of fighter planes that had
                    gone down in different areas. There was a P-38 and a P-47 that had gone down.
                    This fellow took a nurse for a ride in his P-47 but he forgot to check the fuel
                    tank so they got up to about 10,000 feet, ran out of fuel and went straight in.
                    We were able to get their remains out. They were both buried in Arlington
                    Cemetery, one grave for him, one for her, one comingled.</p>
                <p>There was a Corsair that had crashed and gone into a hill so we were able find
                    the engine and part of the tail assembly and wheel. We got a serial number and
                    called Michael Claringbould, an Australian with detailed knowledge of the Fifth
                    Air Force, and he identified the aircraft for us.</p>
                <p>In several cases the villagers had sold the wreckage of the aircraft for scrap
                    metal and had simply kept the remains off to the side. One person did very good
                    job. He got a box and lined it with fabric and dusted it with insecticide and
                    put all the bones in there. So he wanted $500 for that so I think they paid
                    him.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>There was another case where they had all the remains somewhere and so there was
                    a Papua New Guinea policeman along and said, “Look, you can be prosecuted for
                    pulling these remains out and selling the plane but we don't want to take the
                    whole village to jail so what would you like?” So they worked out a deal if they
                    could spend an afternoon at a hotel in the city of Lae with all the beer they
                    could drink and all the French fries they could eat, they would give us the
                    bones of this pilot.</p>
                <p>So they got a van and took everybody into town and got several cases of beer. All
                    the men in the village drank enormous quantities of beer and ate enormous
                    quantities of French fries and then they got in the van and were driven back to
                    the village.</p>
                <p>There was another related case where a wealthy fellow from the U.S. decided to do
                    everything by himself. He did not consult with the U.S. government or the
                    government of Papua New Guinea. He was looking for his uncle's B-24. He just
                    contracted a private helicopter and native guides and what he found instead was
                    a B-25 which had gone into a cliff and then had kind of slid down the cliff and
                    so he thought he would pick up whatever remains were there. It started to rain
                    and so all the villagers said, “Well, we're going home now” and they each had a
                    collection of bones that they had picked up so they were going off in all
                    different directions with all the bones. He said, “Hold it, hold it. Give me all
                    the bones.” So they ripped fabric from the interior of the wreckage and wrapped
                    up the bones in that. So they had all these packets of bones wrapped up in
                    canvas so he put them all in an enormous knapsack. On a Sunday morning his
                    flight out of there back to Australia was at noon so he knocked on the
                    ambassador's door and said, “Here” and gave her this knapsack with comingled
                    skeletal remains of different crew members.</p>
                <p>She came to me later and said, “John, I've got these bones. I don't want them at
                    my house. Will you take them?” I said, “Oh, sure” so I went over and got this
                    knapsack full of bones and they sat in my house but then when the CILHI team
                    came over, they had a forensic pathologist and so we took this knapsack full of
                    human skeletal remains to the embassy and we went into the meeting room, got
                    this big conference room table and spread out some newspaper and he had somebody
                    taking notes and he'd say, “Right femur” and then he'd put it there. Then he'd
                    say, “Left tibia, no, not the same guy. Put that over there.” We were
                    reassembling these sets of skeletal remains from this jumble that we got. He put
                    together as much as he could and then contacted the government of Papua New
                    Guinea and got permission to export human remains and so they were able to
                    export them to Hawaii. I think they were continuing to work with the dental work
                    from the teeth that they had. That was probably one of the best ways. This
                    fellow was very good. To me they were all just a bunch of bones. He was able to
                    get at least three sets of distinct remains. He'd say, “Look, this is a femur
                    and this is one, but they are not from the same man. This one goes over here.
                    These are different people.” He was extremely good at that.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>One other thing that happened was the building that housed the Papua New Guinea
                    ministry of foreign affairs burned down and they did not bother to inform us so
                    I went out to the ministry of foreign affairs to deliver a demarche and found
                    this charred shell of a building with a fence around it. I asked the watchman,
                    “Where have they gone?” He said, “Dunno.”</p>
                <p>Three weeks went by and we got a fax from one of the business centers of one of
                    the hotels in Port Moresby. It said, 'The ministry of foreign affairs presents
                    its compliments and has the honor to inform the embassy of the United States of
                    America that we are temporarily operating out of the business center of the
                    Hilton Hotel.'</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a bit about the political situation there
                        and what was our interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: The prime minister was Bill Skate, who was essentially a gang leader who
                    had worked his way up. There was a connection between the gangs of Rascals and
                    the government. They would hire these Rascals on make-work contracts and pay
                    them government money. For example, they had a lawn care contract but there
                    wasn't a blade of grass in the whole city. Maybe some of the ambassadorial
                    residences would have a small lawn but that was about it. They would get these
                    lawn care contracts for government buildings where there as nothing but bare
                    dirt around the building.</p>
                <p>Another thing that happened was when the Australians turned Papua New Guinea over
                    and it became an independent country a lot of Australians stayed around. They
                    were hired by the government but there were a lot of natives who thought they
                    should get those jobs so they contracted with these gangs of Rascals to harass,
                    abduct and rape the Australian wives of these civil servants who were still
                    there so that they would leave. Or an Australian civil servant contracted to the
                    government of Papua New Guinea would come home and find 20 Rascals sitting in
                    his front yard with cutlasses and revolvers and what have you. He would conclude
                    that it was time for him to go back to Australia. They were used for
                    intimidation; they were used to harass political enemies and so forth.</p>
                <p>Bill Skate was essentially a gangster who had worked his way up to be prime
                    minister. He was suspected of several murders but never charged. His father was
                    an unknown Australian and his mother was from Papua New Guinea. I went to a few
                    sittings of parliament.</p>
                <p>There were some government officials playing golf on a golf course once and they
                    were held up by a gang of Rascals. One of the guys told the Rascals, “You can't
                    hold me up. I am a high government official. I'm the minister of finance.” Not
                    only did they hold him up, they took his pants and shoes.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>The national interest we had was there was oil there and gold, so Chevron had a
                    big outfit there and there was a huge missionary community, the New Tribes
                    missionaries because their mission was to translate the Bible into every known
                    language so they would send out researchers. If they found a tribe that still
                    had enough people speaking the language so they were convinced that the language
                    would not die out, they would live with those people and study the language and
                    figure out a way to transcribe the language, teach the people to read their own
                    language and then print the Bible in that language because it was their mission
                    to make sure that every person on earth had the ability to read the Bible in his
                    or her own language. Since Papua New Guinea has 2,000 languages, they were a
                    busy group.</p>
                <p>Our main missions were providing consular support to Chevron and its employees
                    and doing the same for this very large group of American missionaries there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they, given the crime, was crime pretty well
                        confined to Port Moresby so that the missionaries and Chevron were off
                        somewhere else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Chevron had its headquarters there but they had a pretty well guarded
                    compound and the missionaries were off in a compound all by itself, kind of off
                    away from the towns. The bigger towns like, OK, Moresby was bad, Lae had a lot
                    of crime, and Mount Hagen had crime, a gold mining town. Regarding some of the
                    oil operations, I talked to various people who worked there and they were off in
                    remote locations. They didn't have too much trouble with crime at all.</p>
                <p>The main thing was, we had a Peace Corps program there also and they were out in
                    the small villages but the people of Papua New Guinea had developed sort of an
                    entitlement mentality. They got a lot of money from the Australians and we had
                    very little money to give them so we were not taken seriously. It was not
                    uncommon for the prime minister to make an appointment to see the ambassador and
                    then stand her up at the last minute. The ambassador would arrive at the prime
                    minister's office and the secretary would say, “He went somewhere else.” We were
                    not taken seriously because we did not have these hundreds of thousands of
                    dollars to shovel at them the way the Australians did.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of illegal logging by Indonesian timber companies and once again,
                    an Australian aid organization would come in and say, “We are going to build a
                    clinic and a school. We are going to use this land.” “Well, OK, it's all very
                    well you are going to build a free school and a free clinic, but you have to
                    compensate us for the land on which you are going to build it.” So not only are
                    they getting a free school and a clinic, they are getting extra money for the
                    land.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>The Indonesian loggers, Indonesia is not too far from there, they would come in
                    and some local guy would say, “I'm the chief, I own the forest and I am in
                    charge of it so just pay me X amount of dollars and you can log this land.” So
                    they'd start logging and some other guy would say, “No, I am the chief. This guy
                    is an imposter. You've got to pay me Y amount of dollars” and so there were a
                    lot of fights there.</p>
                <p>There were wars between the tribes up in the mountains. They'd fight each other
                    with spears and slingshots. There was one case where there was a van of workers
                    from one village and a fellow in a car from a different village hit this van and
                    killed three of the workers. Now this one village owed the other village the
                    lives of three people so what they did was one night they got this old woman who
                    had tuberculosis who was about to die and the town drunk and this mentally
                    retarded guy and they tied them all up and left them in the middle of the
                    village and then everybody else took off for the jungle. So the other tribe came
                    in and killed the old woman who was about to die and the mentally retarded guy
                    and the town drunk so that that was cleared because they had killed three people
                    from that village. Then everybody else came back into the village.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Japanese active there because the Japanese lost
                        maybe 100,000 people at New Guinea but also they were left to starve. An
                        awful lot were by passed during the war. I am just wondering about trying to
                        recover the remains.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I don't recall. There was a Japanese embassy there but I don't recall
                    that they were actively involved in remains recovery.</p>
                <p>There was also Irian Jaya which is the western half of the island which is part
                    of Indonesia. There was a small guerrilla movement there because the people
                    there, the natives were treated very badly by the Freeport Mining Company. They
                    were chased out of their mountain area and sent down to the swamps where they
                    got malaria and died and so forth. So there was some violence at the border area
                    also.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you work as sort of a political officer? Was there
                        any politics going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: All we ever got were these instructions for demarches, “Ask Papua New
                    Guinea to vote with us on some resolution in the UN” and we never got a
                    response. We'd go over and make the demarche and so forth.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>The other thing I had to do was send faxes to the Solomon Islands government in
                    Honiara in Guadalcanal and the government of Vanuatu in Port Vila. Their
                    ministry of foreign affairs in Vanuatu was one room in a shopping center in the
                    town that sold souvenirs. They had one little room in the back of a shop that
                    sold souvenirs with a telephone and a fax and that was their ministry of foreign
                    affairs.</p>
                <p>They surely lost money on us there because not only was my wife medically
                    evacuated to Brisbane for surgery on herniated discs, but then she was evacuated
                    again for a fractured skull and head injuries. That wasn't a good post.</p>
                <p>While my wife was in the hospital in Brisbane, I was in a hotel. I was on the
                    telephone to the Department of State trying to get another assignment. It turned
                    out that this was just at the start of the Asian financial crisis. They did have
                    something available in the department of Korean Affairs of the Bureau of East
                    Asian and Pacific Affairs. The Korea desk had something as an economic officer.
                    I went to that department.</p>
                <p>We moved back to the DC area. We were in a series of temporary apartments. My
                    wife had an extremely difficult time because she was suffering from hyperacusis.
                    She was sensitive to the slightest noise. Her auditory system lost the ability
                    to modulate sounds so it would be sort of like you had your stereo on full blast
                    and then turned it off but you didn't turn down the volume so the next time you
                    turned it on, immediately you'd get this full blast of volume. So anytime a
                    refrigerator motor went on or running water in the sink or rustling a newspaper,
                    it was agonizing for her. She spent the first couple of weeks in this temporary
                    apartment. She was in the linen closet with a bunch of pillows wrapped around
                    her head trying to avoid every possible noise.</p>
                <p>Our son quite his job in Portland and came to live with us so that he could take
                    her from one doctor to the next to see if there was anybody who could help.
                    Ultimately, there wasn't.</p>
                <p>Suddenly we were back in the United States with a broken assignment and
                    eventually found a good apartment up at McLean Gardens on Wisconsin Avenue, a
                    little bit south of Tenleytown. I worked in the economic section of the Korea
                    desk and I became active in automobile market access negotiations. We had
                    marathon negotiating sessions with the Koreans, run by the U. S. trade
                    representative's office. I also got involved in negotiations on market access
                    for beef and negotiations on a bilateral investment treaty. I was fairly active
                    there.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of emphasis on North Korea at the time so I also filled in for
                    various other desk officers in the department of Korean affairs as needed. It
                    was good. I was able to keep busy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>CUSHING: Well, monitoring North Korean compliance with the Agreed Framework.
                    There was this deal where they would ostensibly shut down their nuclear reactors
                    and put the fuel rods in cans and put the cans under water and in exchange KEDO,
                    the Korean Economic Development Organization which was a consortium of South
                    Korea and Japan would build them light water reactors in North Korea to provide
                    them with safe nuclear energy but there was not going to be any way they could
                    reprocess it the fuel rods and so forth. So it was a very complicated agreement
                    that was worked out under Bill Clinton. So that was still going on so we would
                    be sending people to North Korea to work on that.</p>
                <p>We did a lot with the Republic of Korea on their economic recovery, monitoring
                    how well they were recovering from the Asian financial crisis and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: They did very well. It was unfortunate that the International Monetary
                    Fund had this sort of Procrustean Bed arrangement with all countries. A lot of
                    small companies in South Korea went out of business because they couldn't get
                    access to credit. It was a very draconian approach and it didn't have to be that
                    draconian in Korea but the new president, Kim Dae Jung handled the crisis fairly
                    well and so they were out of the worst of it within about 18 months. There were
                    a lot of problems but they did OK.</p>
                <p>Interestingly, during the beef market access negotiations the Koreans had a
                    number of very discriminatory practices against imported beef from the United
                    States. They would put it in racks in the back of the store next to the bathroom
                    or they would put it way down on the bottom shelf where it wasn't visible or
                    tell people they didn't have any and so forth.</p>
                <p>The Korean delegation had this young woman who was the interpreter but the
                    terminology got too complicated for her so I ended up as the de facto
                    interpreter for the Korean side during the beef negotiations. This girl got more
                    and more flustered and so I would speak to them in Korean, “Now is this what you
                    are trying to say?” and then I would tell our side in English, “Well, that's not
                    what they meant. They meant this.” That was interesting because I became the
                    interpreter for the Korean side and the U.S. side during the beef
                    negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they come out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>CUSHING: Right after that we had mad cow disease and so they shut all that down
                    again. It was mostly cultural because for Korean beef, there are a lot of small
                    ranchers. They have maybe three or four head of cattle on a farm and they feed
                    them and slaughter them. They simply can't compete with the massive feedlots
                    that are in the U.S. so they could not compete on price and probably not on
                    quality although they said, “No, Korean beef tastes better because it is raised
                    in Korea.” The Japanese had the argument that Japanese intestines can't digest
                    American beef. You can't use American skis in Japan because the snow is
                    different, stuff like that. The Koreans came up with all sorts of similar things
                    like, well, under Confucian tradition, a butcher is the lowest of the low so we
                    feel uncomfortable bringing in meat that was butchered by Americans because we
                    don't know what kind of sanitary conditions were used. They were just pulling
                    stuff out of a hat. It was interesting. It was a good year.</p>
                <p>I did one year there and then I went up to intelligence and research, INR and I
                    did a lot of work on the policies of the Republic of Korea toward the Democratic
                    People's Republic of Korea, North Korea. I ended up doing a lot of research on
                    the northern limit line in the Yellow Sea because there was a line established
                    as part of the armistice but it was not officially included in the agreement. It
                    was an informal understanding that that was what the line was going to be. There
                    is a very lucrative crab fishery in that part of the Yellow Sea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that near Kanghwa? There is an island off the coast.
                        During the Korean War I spent a month sitting there monitoring Soviet
                        airplanes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I am not entirely sure but I know that it, there are a bunch of islands
                    that are still occupied by South Korea just off the coast of North Korea and the
                    line is supposed to go above them but the North Koreans were crossing the line
                    to fish for blue crab and so there was a skirmish there in 1999 between North
                    Korean and South Korean naval craft which ended with the sinking of a North
                    Korean gunboat and several casualties. So that was a big issue.</p>
                <p>I got involved in a lot of research on law of the sea and maritime boundaries and
                    the status of the northern limit line because that was a fairly important issue
                    while I was there.</p>
                <p>I had a fellow there who rewrote virtually everything I ever wrote. I would write
                    something and he would rewrite it entirely and then he would rewrite his own
                    rewrite again. He was constantly rewriting and then when it got into the
                    secretary's morning summary he would say, “That was a good piece you wrote” and
                    I'd just bite my lip because he had rewritten it not only once but twice. I just
                    thought oh, the hell with it. It was interesting and it was good practice in
                    learning how to condense something complicated down to a very short report.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>Then I went to Korean language school in Seoul from August of 2000 to June of
                    2001. It was a very rigorous program. There were a couple of Australians and a
                    fellow from New Zealand. The Korean language school in Seoul had one supervisor
                    and three language teachers and we had an agreement where we would take students
                    from the embassies of the United Kingdom, New Zealand and Australia, anyplace
                    that also spoke English. So we had a couple of Australians, a fellow from New
                    Zealand, it was a pretty small group. I think there were eight students for
                    three teachers so it was very intense. We'd have four hours of class every day
                    and at least four hours of homework. I studied hard every day.</p>
                <p>The Australian woman ended up getting a Korean boyfriend and so she learned her
                    Korean that way. She eventually married the fellow.</p>
                <p>One of the other Americans had a series of Korean girlfriends so he learned
                    Korean that way. I was dropped into the second year. They waived the first year
                    because I had already had Korean language in the Peace Corps so they dropped me
                    into the second year. We had to read newspaper articles everyday and then report
                    on the articles and discuss them in Korean and it was very rigorous. We'd have
                    class from 9 to 3 and then I'd come back and study from 3 until about 9 at night
                    so it was tough.</p>
                <p>We took a study trip in the fall. We were supposed to go off and do an
                    independent study trip so I took a trip to a number of coal mining towns in the
                    northernmost province on the east coast, Kang Won Do, which is where I had been
                    in Peace Corps so I toured the coal mines. I went deep underground at one coal
                    mine and went along with the miners to the end of the seam. We all had these
                    coveralls and helmets with flashlights on the helmets and so forth and got
                    completely coated in coal dust.</p>
                <p>The coal mining industry in Korea was moribund. It was about to close down. It
                    was interesting because it had been very active when I was there in Peace
                    Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The north had coal, didn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: The north has coal; the south has a lot of coal too. They've got more
                    than they know what to do with. They just don't need it as much anymore. They've
                    got nuclear reactors; all their locomotives are diesel, and very little charcoal
                    is used for heating houses or cooking, so I think they pretty much closed down
                    their coal industry. They were running on government subsidies for a while. I
                    think at one point they were thinking of donating coal to North Korea simply
                    because they had more than they could use. A lot of coal mining towns up in the
                    mountains are ghost towns. The whole town has moved away.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>The one thing they did try to do was they built a casino there which was the one
                    place in the whole peninsula where Koreans could go to gamble. So they were
                    getting a lot of people from Seoul coming up there to gamble and so forth. A lot
                    of times they gave the coal miners early retirement and bought their houses and
                    encouraged them to try to find something else to do.</p>
                <p>I took another study trip in April of 2001 to Ulleungdo which is an island off
                    the east coast. They have had a significant loss of population there now. There
                    used to be 30,000 people and now there are 12,000. They grow pumpkins and do a
                    lot of squid fishing and other fishing. They are not too far from the Liancourt
                    Rocks, which they call Dokdo and the Japanese call Takeshima, which are these
                    rocks that are under dispute about who owns them. That was interesting too. I
                    spent a week there, traveled around there. I hiked up to the highest mountain; I
                    took a boat trip around the island and so forth. Also during my year of language
                    study I took music lessons on the Korean flute. I had a good year studying
                    language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: That was August of 2000 to June of 2001. We had various visitors; we had
                    General Pak Sun Yup who had been the youngest Korean general in the Korean War
                    who was sort of an elder statesman. We visited the Korean national cemetery, we
                    visited the graves of Syngman Rhee and Park Chung Hee and so forth, did various
                    museum trips too. I studied really hard. Being in language school there wasn't
                    any such thing as taking a day off. You had the assignment and you had the
                    homework and sometimes I would be the only student with the teacher so you
                    couldn't just come in and say “I didn't do the assignment” because that's what
                    you had to be doing. You couldn't just sit there and struggle through it making
                    stuff up because the assignment had been given the night before so you had to do
                    it so there I was.</p>
                <p>I came into the embassy and the very first thing we encountered was a crisis
                    related to the trafficking in persons report because there was a mandated report
                    that had to cover every country, there was mandated legislation by Congress. You
                    had to do a report on trafficking of persons in each country. In Korea there
                    were a lot of Filipina and Russian girls working near the U.S. military bases,
                    working at the nightclubs right outside the military bases. There were not many
                    Korean girls still working there so they brought in girls from the Philippines,
                    girls from Russia and so forth and they were being kept in abusive conditions.
                    They were recruited in the Philippines and they were told they would be singers
                    and dancers and so forth and then they were forced into prostitution.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>The political officer just before me had attempted to work with the Korean
                    government to get information for the report and all they said was, “We don't
                    have this situation. We don't have a problem. I don't know why you keep
                    bothering us. We have nothing to say to you.” He was forced to say, “The problem
                    exists, but the Korean government denies it exists.” So they were ranked in the
                    lowest possible category. They were in tier three of three tiers which is
                    'Refuses to acknowledge the problem and is not taking any steps to correct it'
                    and so my first day there I was getting these frantic calls from Washington, DC
                    asking, “Can you find out anything the Koreans have done to address the problem
                    of trafficking in persons because otherwise they will end up in tier three and
                    the assistant secretary doesn't want them to be in tier three. It's a big
                    crisis.” There was nothing I could do.</p>
                <p>The next day the report came out and Korea was listed in tier three. They were
                    outraged. I was getting all these outraged telephone calls from the Korean
                    government saying why did you put us in tier three? It later came out that China
                    and Japan had been informally warned a year before that they had to take some
                    steps to correct the problem or they would end up in tier three. So the Chinese
                    were warned, the Japanese were warned, 'Look, there is a TIP report coming out,
                    trafficking in persons, TIP. If you don't do something, you will end up in the
                    lowest level.'</p>
                <p>The Koreans were never warned so when they found out that the governments of
                    China and Japan had been warned and had been given a year to take some steps,
                    they were outraged. Since I was the political officer who had that portfolio, I
                    was getting these outraged calls from all these Korean government officials
                    saying, “Why did you do this?” It was my second day on the job.</p>
                <p>So I formed an interagency task force with the Korean government; the minister of
                    justice, the minister of immigration, human rights council and so forth and so
                    within a year, I was able to get them promoted from tier three to tier one. I
                    said, “Look, you've got to start prosecuting these people.”</p>
                <p>I also worked with the labor attach� of the Filipino government. He was working
                    with his own government. He had a problem there, because to get a working visa,
                    an entertainer's visa from the government of the Philippines, these girls had to
                    take an exam where they would sing a song or dance or something. They were
                    sending in ringers to sing a song for them under a false name. They would send
                    in someone to sing a song and then a little money would change hands and they
                    would get the entertainer's visa.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>We would visit these different entertainment areas around the military camps and
                    talk with the girls. The owner of the establishment would say, “This is
                    outrageous. I treat them very well. Yes, I have all their passports in my safe
                    because they might lose them. You know how Filipinos are with money so I am
                    keeping all their wages in one savings account under my name and when it is
                    time, I will pay them. No, I am not starving them. They have instant noodles
                    whenever they want. I give them an hour every Sunday to go to Mass. These girls
                    aren't unhappy. Someone has been lying to you.”</p>
                <p>I worked together with a young fellow from the Russian embassy and we'd go out
                    and talk to the girls from the former Soviet Union, find out what they were
                    doing. A lot of Russian girls ended up marrying American soldiers and going to
                    live in the United States so that was a pretty good deal for them</p>
                <p>Within one year working with different ministries of the Korean government I was
                    able to get them turned around and up into tier one in the next TIP report and
                    so Secretary Powell sighted cited Korea as a success story.</p>
                <p>Then we had the 2002 presidential elections, which started out with about 20
                    candidates. We had the Grand National Party of Lee Hoi Chang and we had the
                    Millennium Democratic Party of Kim Dae Jung so I covered that extensively. I
                    interviewed all the candidates. The ambassador invited the major candidates to
                    his residence for breakfast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: The ambassador was Thomas Hubbard. Steven Bosworth was the ambassador
                    during my year in language school but he left just as I came in. Ambassador
                    Hubbard arrived in Seoul on the night of September 11, 2001. Just as he got off
                    the plane, the twin towers were attacked. That was his introduction to Seoul. He
                    was a good ambassador, very nice guy, patient, very good guy.</p>
                <p>I covered the 2002 presidential elections. I wrote about 100 cables all told and
                    got a nice cable from Assistant Secretary Kelly praising me for my work. That
                    summer two school girls were run over by an American armored vehicle during
                    maneuvers. They were walking along a road and there was this armored vehicle
                    where the observer and the driver were two different people. The driver couldn't
                    see anything and the observer had to be on the lookout and somebody missed these
                    two girls. They were about 13, 14 years old so these two girls were crushed to
                    death under the treads of this vehicle. At the time it was the World Cup and
                    Korea was doing very well in the World Cup so this kind of got pushed to the
                    background.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>After the World Cup was over, the Korean government said, “We want to try these
                    two American soldiers in our court system” and the American government said,
                    “No. Under the Status of Forces Agreement we will try them.” They were both
                    tried and the defense of the observer was “the intercom was working, I saw the
                    girls, I screamed 'stop, stop' and the driver didn't stop. The defense of the
                    driver was “the intercom wasn't working and I didn't hear anything and so I ran
                    over the girls.” Here are these two completely contradictory defenses and yet
                    they were both acquitted. So they were both acquitted and left the country and
                    the Koreans were outraged.</p>
                <p>There were massive demonstrations that went from August all the way through
                    December of 2002. There were candlelight vigils, they would have to ring the
                    American embassy with police buses, bumper to bumper and they'd have riot police
                    outside of them. There were huge, huge demonstrations.</p>
                <p>I went out and covered them by pretending to be a foreigner who didn't speak
                    English. I would work my way through the police lines and kind of stand in the
                    back during the speeches and memorize the speeches and collect the leaflets and
                    the posters and so forth. The DCM said, “Well, I don't really like what you are
                    doing. If I ever see you on TV you will be out of the country. If I ever see you
                    on television or I hear that you said anything, you will be finished in this
                    embassy” but I continued to do it and never got caught. I'd go to these
                    candlelight vigils at night.</p>
                <p>I also observed a number of strikes, scuffles between workers and the police and
                    so forth. There were issues with foreign workers because a number of Korean
                    industries that technologically just should have been shut down because China
                    was already more competitive, were being kept alive by bringing in foreign
                    workers from say Mongolia or Sri Lanka or just any number of, countries, also
                    the Philippines. They would bring in these foreign workers as trainees. The
                    theory was they were there as trainees so they didn't have to be paid the
                    minimum wage and so there were a number of small industries in plastics and
                    various other little factories that were being kept alive by using foreign
                    workers. Human rights groups were saying, “Oh, these workers are being abused”
                    and so forth. I got involved in that issue also.</p>
                <p>Under the new government of Roh Moo Hyun they were reforming labor laws because
                    after the economic crisis a lot of workers had been brought back in as part time
                    contract workers, did not have the same rights as regularly employed workers and
                    so there was a lot of tension there between the unions and the government.</p>
                <p>The unions had assumed that Roh Moo Hyun was going to be on their side because he
                    ran on a platform of moderate anti Americanism. This was right during the whole
                    brouhaha about the two girls being crushed to death. He said, “By God, when I am
                    president, no American is going to run over two Korean citizens and get away
                    with it.”</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>So he was elected and not too long after that he was impeached in the National
                    Assembly for supposedly speaking out in favor of his political party, because
                    the president is not allowed to make political commentary so he was suspended
                    from office and impeached and so I covered that also.</p>
                <p>I was also the control officer for Dr. Kissinger when he visited to commemorate
                    the 50th anniversary of the end of the Korean War. It was an active time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How stood relations? There had been earlier a new
                        generation had come along and no longer as, you might say grateful or
                        appreciative of what the United States had done.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: When I was there, there was this radical Catholic priest, Father Moon,
                    who held demonstrations in a small park about a block away from the Korean
                    embassy and their complaint was that the United States had conspired with the
                    Soviet Union to divide Korea so it was the United States' fault that Korea had
                    been divided.</p>
                <p>Also in Bush's State of the Union address he named North Korea along with Iraq
                    and Iran as part of an “axis of evil.” No one had bothered to check with the
                    State Department on that. We were listening to the State of the Union address
                    and he referred to North Korea as part of the 'axis of evil' and so our jaws
                    kind of dropped there and the Koreans were miffed because they were trying to
                    get all warm and fuzzy with North Korea and they said, “Oh, look. Now you hurt
                    their feelings. It's going to make it harder for us.”</p>
                <p>There was a lot of sympathy for North Korea as sort of a misunderstood family
                    member who if treated with loving kindness would come around. Kim Dae Jung had
                    the sunshine policy. He had a summit meeting with Kim Jong Il in summer 2000. It
                    turned out the administration of Kim Dae Jung transferred secretly about 100
                    million dollars to Kim Jong Il in order to have the summit meeting so
                    essentially Kim Dae Jung was paying Kim Jong Il 100 million dollars to allow the
                    south to send them free rice and free fertilizer which is sort of the same thing
                    that I saw in New Guinea. OK, you can build us a free school and a clinic but
                    you have to compensate us for loss of use of the land. Same kind of thing.</p>
                <p>There were older Koreans who remembered the war and often when there was a large,
                    anti-American demonstration at one point there would be a pro American
                    demonstration several blocks away with Korean War veterans, Koreans who had
                    served in the South Korean army during the war and were grateful to the
                    Americans, and they would be waving American flags and saying God bless
                    President Bush and so forth.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>There is a statue of MacArthur on top of a hill in Inchon and there was a
                    movement to remove the statue. People were saying “This is an anachronism of the
                    Cold War, we're going to take it down, and we don't need it.” These Korean War
                    veterans formed a ring around the statue, saying, “We love General MacArthur and
                    if you are going to take the statue down, you are going to have to kill us
                    first.”</p>
                <p>The older generation was dying out. The younger generation was resentful of the
                    military presence which has since been scaled back and also they are moving out
                    of that huge base in Yongsan in the heart of Seoul, moving farther south and
                    they are pulling a lot of people off the demilitarized zone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the North Koreans doing? Were they doing
                        anything to sort of play up to this? One has the feeling they are not the
                        most subtle people in the world.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: They were allowing family visits. People would send in applications to
                    the Red Cross. The North and South Korean Red Cross would work together so they
                    had these, limited reunions; there was a resort area in the north just north of
                    the demilitarized zone with this really famous mountain, Kum Kang San, and
                    Hyundai Corporation set up a resort there with hotels and had these very tightly
                    restricted tours where they'd come in by ship and stay on the ship and tour the
                    mountain and go back to the ship and later they started allowing them in by bus
                    but all the workers at the resort were Koreans from China. They wouldn't allow
                    North Koreans to work there. They held family reunions at this resort at Kum
                    Kang San. Families from the south would be allowed to go up there and selected
                    families from the north that had been divided would go there so they had these
                    very dramatic reunions but on a very limited scale. The north sent a few family
                    groups down to the south to meet, but took pains too to make sure they didn't
                    get a look at Seoul or anything. They would be bused to these rather isolated
                    resorts where that would meet family members from the south but there was
                    absolutely no political discussion whatsoever and they were not allowed to
                    exchange any presents of real value or anything. That was kind of the one
                    concession the north made. They allowed these very tightly restricted groups of
                    tourists into a small part of North Korea.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>They started an industrial zone near the North Korean town of Kaesong where the
                    South Koreans would bring in the raw materials and the supervisory staff and
                    they would employ North Koreans who would be paid three or four hundred dollars
                    a month and the North Korean government would keep all but $50 of that. The
                    North Korean worker would end up with $50 a month and the North Korean
                    government would get $350 of his wages. There was this joint cooperative
                    industrial area, there was limited tourism and there were limited family
                    reunions. There was a sunshine policy under Kim Dae Jung based on Aesop's fable
                    of trying to get the winter coat off a man. The sun and the wind saw a man
                    wearing a really heavy coat and so they made a bet. The wind said, “I bet I can
                    get that coat off him.” So the cold wind blew harder and harder and the harder
                    it blew, the tighter the man clutched his overcoat. The sun said, “OK, now it's
                    my turn.” So the sun shone on the man, he got hotter and hotter and finally he
                    took off the overcoat.</p>
                <p>So President Kim Dae Jung said, “My sunshine policy is based on the philosophy
                    that if you are nice to these people they will come around. All you have to do
                    is be warm and fuzzy and send them rice and fertilizer and they will appreciate
                    it and they'll help us.” Finally, in 2007, Korea elected a president that said,
                    “This is bullshit.”</p>
                <p>I finished at the embassy in Seoul in May of 2004 and the person who was my wife
                    at the time had an aversion to cold weather, being rather thin and sensitive to
                    cold so I had an opportunity to study two years of Chinese language and then go
                    to a posting in Chengdu but when she read the post report, she read that it was
                    often cloudy and gloomy. The winter days were short and cold and cloudy and the
                    winter nights were long and cold and cloudy so she said, “I'm not going there”
                    so</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Chengdu Harbin or Mukden?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: No, Chengdu is down in the southwest of China. That is where the rioting
                    mob trashed the principal officer's residence after the bombing in Belgrade
                    where the three Chinese “reporters” were killed.</p>
                <p>At any rate once again misfortune struck. Back before we went to Port Moresby we
                    had a chance to go to Costa Rica but she said, “Oh, we've already been to
                    Guatemala. Let's not get stuck in a rut in Central America” so we went to Port
                    Moresby where she was attacked and almost killed. So once again she said, “Oh, I
                    don't want you to study Chinese for two years and then go to Chengdu because it
                    is dark and cold.”</p>
                <p>So I bid on a public affairs position in Cotonou, Benin in West Africa. So we
                    went over there. I had public diplomacy training in Washington, DC from July to
                    December, 2004. We had an apartment in Ballston and I walked over the Foreign
                    Affairs Training Center every day for that. So we were in the States for the
                    2004 election.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>Some of the things I did in Cotonou were, we set up an awards program for
                    outstanding journalists and the ambassador awarded awards to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cotonou is the capital of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Actually Porto Novo is the capital but most of the government ministries
                    and the presidential mansion and so forth are in Cotonou so it is kind of an
                    unusual situation because Porto Novo is about an hour's drive to the east, not
                    too far from the border. Benin is a little country just west of Nigeria.</p>
                <p>Mathieu Kerekou, the president, originally took over in a military coup and
                    eventually was elected in a presidential election; there were hangers-on who
                    were encouraging him to change the constitution so that he could run again but
                    the ambassador made a few speeches suggesting that the constitution be adhered
                    to as it was written and not amended and so the president very indignantly said
                    he never had any intention of attempting to run again. He stepped down and there
                    were presidential elections.</p>
                <p>The ambassador had an extensive art collection so I worked on the art in embassy
                    brochures, took a bunch of photographs of those and worked them up in
                    brochures.</p>
                <p>We had a fair amount of staff turnover at the American Cultural Center. I hired a
                    new librarian, a new student adviser and a new cultural officer. We had a bare
                    bones budget so it was a fairly difficult post because there was rarely enough
                    money to do any of the things I would have liked. I worked entirely in
                    French.</p>
                <p>The roof was repaired with tar paper but they forgot to overlap the seams so one
                    rainy season I had about four inches of water in most of my office. I had a
                    carpet so they brought in some plastic sheeting so I just, I had a pool of about
                    four inches of water in most of my office for several months, maybe about six
                    months and I had mushrooms growing there and stuff like that. There just wasn't
                    enough money for anything.</p>
                <p>We got completely blown away by the French because the French were the former
                    colonial power there. They had a military mission and they had an enormous
                    embassy and they had an enormous cultural center with two performance spaces,
                    one partially indoors and one out and they gave performances really often, and
                    also had a big library.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>We were tucked away in kind of an out of the way location, off of the beach front
                    road and we got a fair number of people who wanted to study in the United States
                    because we had a student adviser. We were also able to institute a program where
                    students could take the test of English as a foreign language on the computer in
                    Cotonou. We got that set up finally. Prior to that they had to go to Lagos,
                    Nigeria or to Accra, Ghana to take the test so this helped a good bit. We had a
                    fair number of students who went to the United States to study. We tried to help
                    them get scholarships.</p>
                <p>It was a very difficult post. There wasn't a heck of a lot to do. That is where
                    my marriage finally came unglued. My wife left so I finished that post by
                    myself.</p>
                <p>We had an English school and we had a lot of problems with that but rather than
                    cast disparaging remarks on the fellow who was the ambassador there, I think I
                    might just leave it at that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Wayne Neil. We had a lot of problems. It was tough, it was tough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any interest in Benin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Preserving democracy, I guess. It is one of the 20 poorest countries in
                    the world. I honestly don't know. Most of what the political section did, I
                    think was just presenting demarches and so forth. There was a moderate interest
                    in having an orderly succession of presidents and so after the new president was
                    elected, President Bush's public affairs person, Karen Hughes flew over and met
                    the president and there was a little bit of hoopla about that but other than
                    that, it was a little backwater country, very primitive, a great deal of
                    corruption, a small post and morale was not great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are saying from a public diplomacy side that basically
                        the French had control over that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Well, the French pushed their message. They were friendly, we were
                    tolerated and so forth but France being sort of the mother country, the former
                    colonial power and so forth and French being the official language there, they
                    really had the inside track.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it make any difference? In a way in some places, put
                        our resources somewhere else.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>CUSHING: We had a few good things. We brought a traveling group over that sang
                    American folk songs and they were very popular. We had a couple of concerts in
                    Cotonou. We went out to Porto Novo and gave a concert there and went out to
                    Ouidah and gave a concert there. We had the international visitor's program so
                    we were able to send some young professionals from Benin to the United States on
                    study tours. We had a visiting speaker's program so we had people who spoke on
                    various aspects of American politics and culture and so forth. It was very much
                    a backwater country.</p>
                <p>I think a lot of interest in Africa was formerly based on the Cold War; the fact
                    that the United States was vying with the Soviet Union and China for influence
                    there and it was considered sort of a pivotal continent.</p>
                <p>President Bush actually had a good initiative. The President's Emergency Program
                    for Aids Relief, PEPFAR and that was well received there. There was a Peace
                    Corps program there and so forth but it was by and large a small and unimportant
                    country. I kind of remember it mostly as the place where my marriage came to an
                    end and my wife had a breakdown and left. Let's just say it wasn't the highest
                    spot of my Foreign Service career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I was there from late December of 2004 until about May of 2007, so about
                    2 � years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did any students from Benin go to the United States and
                        take a full course of studies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Oh, yes, quite a few.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what did they do? Did they come back?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>CUSHING: Some came back, some stayed there. There was actually a woman who was a
                    professor at the University of Arizona. She came from a prominent family there.
                    A lot of the elite had Portuguese names because there was a Portuguese business
                    family there where the fellow had a lot of different wives and so there would be
                    many Beninese who looked totally African but would have Portuguese names so this
                    lady was Dr. D'Almeida and we gave a presentation at a university there and she
                    had a interesting experience because she was talking to the students in Benin
                    and she said, “If you mention African American life in America and if you
                    mention African Americans to people in Africa, and if you mention Africans to
                    African Americans in the United States, they both respond with the same word,
                    which is 'savages'" so there was a total misconception on both sides as to what
                    life was like for people so we worked on that a bit. I think by and large among
                    a lot of folks in the United States, there is not a great deal of understanding
                    about the vast diversity of countries on the African continent and so forth.
                    Africa is traditionally viewed as sort of a hopeless place.</p>
                <p>At any rate, that was my foray into public diplomacy. I did reasonably well with
                    the limited resources that I had. It was a tough post in a lot of ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much interest in American culture?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Some, yes, there was some. Since the language of education was French
                    and English was a second language, people primarily would get scholarships to
                    France to study. There was some interest in American culture but not a great
                    deal. France just seemed culturally and even geographically quite a bit closer
                    than the United States so that was how it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 2007?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: My final post was Port of Spain in Trinidad and Tobago and that was
                    interesting. It was tough because that was the first place I went without my
                    wife and we had a long period of separation that finally ended in divorce.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>Trinidad and Tobago has considerable importance as being sort of the economic
                    powerhouse of the southern Caribbean. It has liquid natural gas, it has
                    petroleum reserves. About 70 % of the liquid natural gas that is supplied to the
                    United States comes from Trinidad. It is comparatively well developed; they have
                    shopping malls there and a cinema multiplex and restaurants and apartment
                    buildings. It is a curious mixture because it has a lot of first world aspects
                    but it also has a lot of rural poverty and bad roads and crime and corruption so
                    it's kind of a mix.</p>
                <p>The other interesting thing about Trinidad and Tobago is you have the racial
                    division. Formerly there was sugar and coffee and a lot of the agricultural work
                    was performed by African slaves until slavery was abolished in Britain and then
                    the slaves were freed and they needed people to work in agriculture so they
                    finally concluded that indentured servants from India would be the best bet. In
                    the 1850s they brought in a number of Indians and more and more boatloads of
                    Indians came over so it is partly analogous to Fiji in the Pacific in that the
                    population is about 40 % of African origin, 40 % of East Indian origin and there
                    is an amalgam of mixed race; Syrians, Lebanese, French, Venezuelan, Chinese.</p>
                <p>The two major political parties tended to form on the basis of race. The People's
                    National Movement predominated in politics. They had been in power most of the
                    time there. The United National Congress had power for a while but there was a
                    deadlock in Parliament and the president decided that the leader of the People's
                    National Movement would be a more appropriate prime minister so they named him
                    the prime minister and he's had power ever since.</p>
                <p>The leader of the United National Congress, Basdeo Panday, was a former labor
                    leader and a very flamboyant fellow but getting on in years. They added five
                    seats to Parliament so it used to be 21 for the People's National Movement and
                    16 for the Congress of the People but then they added five more seats but this
                    just resulted in more gains for the People's National Movement. I believe there
                    are now 26 PNM seats to 15 for the United National Congress.</p>
                <p>There was an upstart party in the 2007 elections. The Congress of the People was
                    a new party that came in and they attempted to draw off middle class voters,
                    people who wanted a new approach, establish post-ethnic politics and so forth
                    and they got 23% of the vote but no seats just because of the way the votes were
                    distributed.</p>
                <p>There is a great deal of crime there based on narcotics smuggling. It is only
                    seven miles from Venezuela so a lot of narcotics come over by boat at night so
                    you have cocaine and so forth arriving for transshipment to Europe. Put it on a
                    plane there, send it off to Europe.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>Weapons, lots of illegal firearms brought in and sold. There are some
                    neighborhoods in Port of Spain where you simply don't want to go. The people who
                    live there can go there if they roll the windows of their car down and go in
                    very slowly because they have sentries at all the streets that enter and
                    sometimes there are gangs at war from neighborhoods who are very close to each
                    other so the people who live in one neighborhood, sometimes they cannot go a few
                    blocks down the street because that territory is controlled by a different gang
                    or sometimes they can't cross the street because the block on the other side of
                    the street is controlled by a different gang. Sometimes people are killed simply
                    for being at the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>
                <p>There used to be a lot of kidnapping for ransom, primarily East Indian
                    businessmen would be kidnapped and held for ransom. There was a period when a
                    number of them sent their families out of the country and stayed by themselves.
                    An American citizen was kidnapped and killed about three years ago and so the
                    FBI got involved, broke up that gang so the number of kidnappings went down
                    considerably. I think there was exactly one Syrian kidnapped, once. The Syrians
                    got to the kidnappers before the police did and chopped them up into little
                    pieces and mailed the pieces to the other gangs and said “This is what happens
                    when you kidnap a Syrian.” That was the end of that.</p>
                <p>There was a fair amount of work at the embassy trying to fight crime. We have the
                    Drug Enforcement Agency down there; we have a legal attach� from the Federal
                    Bureau of Investigation. They were also working with Guyana, the neighbor of
                    Venezuela which is also a very lawless place. I never got over to Guyana; I
                    guess it is a pretty wild place.</p>
                <p>Trinidad was a small island but there was a fair amount to do. There was
                    excellent bird watching and you could see the leatherback turtles come up on the
                    beach to lay their eggs and you could go to the swamp and see the Scarlet Ibis
                    flying in, so forth.</p>
                <p>I joined a choral group there; we would rehearse in the evenings twice a week and
                    give concerts in the summer and at Christmas. That was good.</p>
                <p>The big thing that happened there was that Trinidad and Tobago hosted the Summit
                    of the Americas and in April of 2009 so that was a tremendous undertaking
                    because we had the new president come down, the secretary of state, a number of
                    congressional delegations decided they would come along too and so logistically,
                    Embassy Port of Spain is a comparatively small post and we were swamped; we had
                    a tremendous amount of work to do. They sent a huge number of temporary people
                    to help us and of course, we had a presidential advance team and we had to scout
                    out all the sites and get permission from the local government to photograph the
                    sites and lay out the floor plans and everything. It was a tremendous
                    undertaking. It went off successfully.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>The government tends to be disorganized unless something is really important to
                    them. The most important thing for anybody down there is carnival time where
                    right before Lent they have several days of carnival where they buy these exotic
                    costumes and they all march in groups. They've got a sound truck with an
                    enormous bunch of speakers blasting away. People dance in the streets for two
                    days and two nights. Carnival is a big deal.</p>
                <p>I was talking to a fellow from Venezuela who said, “Well, the only way Summit of
                    the Americas will come off without a hitch is if it is as important to them as
                    carnival is because that is the only thing that starts on time.” There is a very
                    laid back attitude toward doing anything on time, starting something on
                    time.</p>
                <p>The government suffers from a fair amount of disorganization and corruption.
                    There is a middle class. There is a lot of poverty out in the country because
                    the government tends to neglect areas that are going to vote for the United
                    National Congress which is the opposition, so there is a fair amount of
                    discontent.</p>
                <p>They are trying to revive parts of agriculture. They closed down the sugar
                    industry not that long ago. They are trying to get coffee and chocolate revived
                    but they are essentially a one resource economy. They have their liquid natural
                    gas and there is still petroleum that they are extracting.</p>
                <p>In terms of foreign policy, they have this Caribbean Economic Community, CARICOM
                    so they tend to vote with CARICOM and they try to strike an independent line
                    from the United States. Trinidad and Tobago actually voted with the United
                    States only about 18% of the time in the United Nations. Still, relations are
                    good.</p>
                <p>There is a British high commission and a Canadian high commission and an
                    Australian high commission because being a former British colony and a
                    Commonwealth country, they still have strong relations with other Commonwealth
                    countries. And there is a Japanese embassy and a small Korean embassy and then
                    various South American countries; Mexico, Venezuela and some of the other
                    smaller South and Central American countries have embassies there also.</p>
                <p>It is a very nice setting. It is on the Gulf of Paria and it has hills, fairly
                    tall, steep hills in the background so some of the residential neighborhoods go
                    up into the valleys and so forth. It was interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do we have any installations there; airplanes or
                        ships?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>CUSHING: No, it was very important during the Second World War. There use to be a
                    number of airfields there, because of the German U-boats in the Caribbean. They
                    have pretty much all been closed down. The northwestern part of the island used
                    to be totally controlled by the United States. I guess they leased it and they
                    held onto it until the early 1960s when it was finally returned.</p>
                <p>What we had a couple of times were ship visits where the United States navy has
                    hospital ships that are designed primarily for goodwill visits so they would
                    come and they would have a team of doctors, dentists, various specialists. They
                    would go out and establish temporary clinics in traditionally underserved parts
                    of the island and they got a very good response because for all its wealth, the
                    public health system there is not very good.</p>
                <p>The prime minister himself, whenever he has a medical problem flies to Cuba. He
                    had a pacemaker installed in Cuba, he had artificial valves installed in Cuba
                    and he had cancer of the kidney last December, flew to Cuba to get his cancerous
                    kidney removed.</p>
                <p>So people are always saying, “OK, if the public system here is so good, how is it
                    that any time the Prime Minister has a health problem, he flies off to Cuba?” In
                    the interests of Caribbean solidarity, they don't charge him there. They just
                    fly him there and fix whatever is going on and then bring him back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Our ambassador was Dr. Roy Austin. Dr. Austin was originally from the
                    island of St. Vincent and he studied in the United States and became a professor
                    there. St. Vincent is not too far from Trinidad and Tobago. You've got St.
                    Vincent and the Grenadines, just north of Grenada. He got a scholarship to study
                    in the United States and as is traditional for people who get scholarships
                    there, he deferred his study for a few years so he could work and save up some
                    money for personal expenses. He ended up going to Yale at the same time as
                    George W. Bush. I believe they were either roommates or in the same fraternity.
                    He is a personal friend of George W. Bush. He was named ambassador in 2001, I
                    believe, so he was there for an extended period of time. He was there until
                    January 20 of 2009 when our new president was inaugurated so he had quite a long
                    run as an ambassador. He was a professor of criminology at Penn State when he
                    was asked to be the ambassador. He was able to relate to the people very well so
                    he got along quite well.</p>
                <p>The prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago had been a member of Parliament for a
                    long time. I think he was first elected in 1972 and he was the leader of the
                    party after they had a couple of setbacks but they are now in a comfortable
                    majority.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>I guess the other thing worth mentioning was there was a coup by a radical Muslim
                    group in Port of Spain in 1990. They took over the Parliament and held the
                    members of Parliament hostage and a police station in Port of Spain was burned
                    down and there was widespread looting and disorder for about three or four days
                    until the army finally restored order and the leaders of this coup
                    surrendered.</p>
                <p>The person who led the coup is still free. Apparently, one of the agreements they
                    had for freeing the hostages was that there would be an amnesty. So he is free
                    and he runs an Islamic school in Port of Spain and he is allegedly involved in
                    illegal quarrying. Quarrying is big business because there is still a fair
                    amount of construction there, they are digging up the hillsides for gravel. They
                    have a significant problem with flooding when it rains. The streets in Port of
                    Spain tend to fill up with water because the drains are clogged with plastic
                    bottles and other refuse that people toss into the drains.</p>
                <p>One of the other issues is Chinese foreign workers. A lot of the big government
                    construction projects now are being built by Chinese labor. There will be a
                    private contracting group that will work something out with the government and
                    then bring in a whole bunch of Chinese construction workers, house them in
                    fairly basic conditions and have them do the construction work. People complain
                    that these construction jobs should be going to local people but the retort of
                    the local contractors trying to get the construction done is, “Well, the local
                    people won't work a full day.” If you hire a person from Trinidad, he will find
                    a big piece of hollow pipe and go in there and start taking a nap or something.
                    It is really difficult to get people to work.</p>
                <p>They had a couple of make work projects that were also subject to corruption.
                    There was CEPEP, which was the Community Environmental Protection and Economic
                    Preservation program where they would get people who were traditionally
                    unemployed, they would hire them to do a weed whacking job on the side of the
                    road or rake up things or clean out the drains but it was mostly a matter of
                    signing in and doing a minimal amount of work and getting paid and then leaving
                    before noon and going out and doing whatever else they wanted to do.</p>
                <p>Then there was the URP, the Unemployment Relief Program which tended to be taken
                    over by the gang leaders. The prime minister had the idea that if he turned
                    these gang leaders into “community leaders” and entrepreneurs that they would
                    leave their life of crime, and so what happened there was they would take a lump
                    sum of money and then they would put together a list of phantom employees, all
                    of whom would be paid but the gang leader who was now this community
                    entrepreneur would dole out a little bit of money to each person who signed up
                    as a ghost employee and some to his two or three followers and keep most of it
                    for himself. There was a lot of corruption in that.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>A lot of areas where these supposed community improvement projects were taking
                    place were so dangerous that government inspectors would not even go up there.
                    They didn't even want to go up there and have a look at what was going on. This
                    was one reason a lot of gang leaders were getting killed was because someone
                    else would want to be the person in charge of getting these large sums of money
                    connected to a contract and so they would kill the leader and take his
                    place.</p>
                <p>The murder rate was extremely high. The population is about 1.3 million and I
                    believe in 2008 there were something like 550 murders, which is extremely high.
                    It is maybe not quite as high as Jamaica but it is high.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these mostly gang murders?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Mostly turf wars, gang leaders killing each other, people caught in the
                    crossfire.</p>
                <p>There was a case where a little ten year old girl was found strangled and stuffed
                    under an abandoned house and the story going around was that her mother was
                    using her as a courier running cash for drug deals; she didn't know what was
                    going on but she would have a lunchbox full of cash and they'd tell her, “Take
                    this down the street and give it to the man who says hello to you on the
                    corner.” At some point she took the money down and either it wasn't enough money
                    or someone stole the money and murdered this little girl. Every now and then
                    there is a child killed, either caught in crossfire or abducted and killed or
                    something like that. There is a big hue and cry for a couple of days and then
                    everything goes back to normal.</p>
                <p>The national culture is based on loud music, alcohol and fornication. That's
                    pretty much it, which of course has its apex at carnival. People are always
                    partying. They are famous for the steel drums. During the war they got these oil
                    drums and converted them into musical instruments so that's considered an
                    integral part of their culture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the songs too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Oh, the calypso.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember as a kid during World War II. There was a
                        famous song, Drinking Rum and Coca Cola. Bing Crosby and the Andrew
                        sisters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In a culture based on fornication was there anything you could contribute to that
                    as far as the USIA public diplomacy point of view?</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>CUSHING: Not really. I was the chief of the political section so I had one junior
                    officer and two assistants working with me. We put a lot of effort into INL,
                    international narcotics and law enforcement. We had a certain pot of money so we
                    would work with the government of Trinidad and Tobago in terms of training. We
                    had people come down to train people on financial crimes, money laundering and
                    the Drug Enforcement Agency was extremely active also. They were not allowed to
                    participate operationally but they would do a lot of intelligence sharing with
                    the law enforcement authorities. I think as in most countries, the quantities of
                    drugs interdicted and people arrested were just a small, small percentage of the
                    amount that was getting through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought this would have been a place as a
                        senior officer you would have been concerned about your junior officers
                        getting into trouble in crime things or inadvertently or what have you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: No, the junior officers, a lot of them were already married, even the
                    consular officers. I had a very good junior officer; he was already married and
                    had two daughters, a very hard worker and his wife was the community liaison
                    officer so she organized cultural excursions and trips and things like that.</p>
                <p>Because of the mix of cultures the East Indian and the African based culture,
                    there were a lot of things to do; a lot of interesting arts and crafts and music
                    and dance and so forth and they actually had a pretty good national museum that
                    traced the history of Trinidad and Tobago, the Spanish settlement, the petroleum
                    industry, the Second World War and they had a huge section on carnival costumes
                    also because that's where a lot of the creativity came in was designing these
                    costumes for carnival.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved or did he go there, Naipaul or what
                        was his name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: V.S. Naipaul was born there, then left on a scholarship to England. He
                    wrote a couple of his books about Trinidad. He is kind of considered an
                    ungrateful native son because when he got his Nobel Prize for Literature he
                    didn't mention Trinidad once. In his memoirs he talks about how he couldn't wait
                    to get out of there, how his father was a reporter for the Guardian newspaper
                    but never had a particularly successful career. Naipaul referred to Trinidad as
                    a small island for small men with small dreams.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>CUSHING: Kind of off and on; I was there from June of 2007 through July of this
                    year, 2009 but I was medically evacuated for four months. I had some medical
                    issues so I was medically evacuated to the States at the end of June, 2008 and
                    then I spent some time in hospital in Miami and then I went out to San Francisco
                    and spent a fair amount of time waiting for surgery there. I eventually had the
                    surgery in early September and recuperated and got back there in early November
                    so I guess July, August, September, October, four months I was out of there on
                    medical evacuation status and fortunately my junior officer was a very capable
                    fellow and just filled in and did what needed to be done. We also had very good
                    local staff; we had a Trinidadian woman who used to work in the office of the
                    president and she knew all the major people in politics, economics, business,
                    the police and we had another woman who had extensive experience in
                    international narcotics and law enforcement so she worked very well with the
                    junior officer on that.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of budget and fiscal work and program monitoring and checking on
                    the status of the equipment that we had loaned to them and so forth. We had
                    things like patrol aircraft and patrol boats and so forth. We had a kind of
                    combined approach because from the Department of State we had this international
                    narcotics and law enforcement program which also included sending police and
                    military officers up to the United States for training and then we had the Drug
                    Enforcement Agency, then we had the Federal Bureau of Investigation and we also
                    had someone from the United States Customs working with the customs department
                    of Trinidad and Tobago, helping them out with custom, as well as a Military
                    Liaison Officer. We did a fair amount of good work down there.</p>
                <p>The corridors for shipping drugs would shift back and forth. If you put pressure
                    on the west, if you tried to shut down the area from Colombia up to say Haiti or
                    the Dominican Republic, it would shift eastward and it has gotten to the point
                    now where there are some aircraft that fly from Colombia all the way to West
                    Africa and they don't bother to try to get the aircraft back. They just land it
                    somewhere and offload the drugs and maybe set the aircraft on fire or just leave
                    it there. Narcotics were a big problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there and it still continues with the advent of
                        Hugo Chavez in Venezuela and particularly as he developed it turned things
                        around as far as our relations with that country. Today they are not good.
                        Did the Chavez regime impact at all on Trinidad and your work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>CUSHING: Their foreign policy is based primarily on not upsetting Venezuela. They
                    have to be careful because they are so close, and they have some shared cross
                    border gas fields. The liquid natural gas is all under the sea and Venezuela had
                    this ALBA free trade program of its own but Trinidad and Tobago decided to stick
                    with FTAA, Free Trade Area of the Americas and the various programs with
                    CARICOM. They don't qualify for a lot of the trade benefits because they are
                    considered an advanced country, since they have a comparatively high gross
                    domestic product per capita. There was a little bit of a falling out. I think
                    Prime Minister Patrick Manning visited Caracas one time and announced that he
                    was sticking with the Free Trade Area of the Americas instead of joining with
                    ALBA.</p>
                <p>Also there is another program that Venezuela has, Petrocaribe, where they sell
                    petroleum products to small Caribbean nation island states at very concessionary
                    rates; give them a loan to buy the petroleum and charge very low interest and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>Chavez has thrown a lot of money around in the Caribbean and in other Central
                    American countries trying to set up this anti-American axis, working with
                    Bolivia and Ecuador and so forth. He had been on the outs with Colombia for
                    quite a while.</p>
                <p>The major foreign policy initiative of Trinidad and Tobago is not to upset
                    Venezuela. They have to live with them as neighbors. You can see Venezuela from
                    Trinidad and Tobago. Not to sound like Sarah Palin, but you can see Venezuela
                    from there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there sort of Venezuelan agents prowling around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Probably. They had a big embassy. I got along pretty well with the
                    Venezuelans. The Venezuelans have a cultural center where they give free Spanish
                    language lessons and some of our people took advantage of that.</p>
                <p>We had a couple of incidents where a patrol plane flew into Venezuelan air space
                    inadvertently one time so there was a little bit of a tiff about that and Chavez
                    expelled the United States ambassador to Venezuela at one time so the Venezuelan
                    ambassador was sent out of the United States. Now they are back.</p>
                <p>The thing is Chavez just keeps stomping out one democratic institution after
                    another; he revokes the broadcasting licenses for independent radio and
                    television stations and clamps down on the media, clamps down on businesses and
                    so forth. He appears to be making a total hash of the economy. PDVSA, the state
                    petroleum company, their production is falling because they haven't kept up with
                    the latest technology and maintenance and so forth and Chavez has sort of set up
                    a parallel economy but there are shortages of basic food items and so forth.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>They have people keeping an eye on things in Trinidad and Tobago but there is not
                    a great deal of tension. There is a large Venezuelan embassy there and people
                    get along OK.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Cuba?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Really small. The Cuban embassy, is located above an auto parts store.
                    There is an auto parts store and the second floor is the Cuban embassy and I
                    guess there is an ambassador and maybe two other people. Trinidad and Tobago has
                    a trade promotion center in Cuba and also an embassy there. But very few people
                    in Trinidad and Tobago speak Spanish, a very small number considering how close
                    they are, it just never really caught on. They say the rule of thumb there is
                    the lower a person's social status is, the more likely he is to know Spanish
                    because the fishermen get involved with the Venezuelan navy and coast guard from
                    time to time because they crossed over the maritime boundary so they know some
                    Spanish and the smugglers who bring in the drugs and the guns and also transport
                    people, primarily young ladies for the entertainment industry, also know Spanish
                    but the higher classes pride themselves on speaking impeccable British English
                    and not knowing a word of Spanish.</p>
                <p>Actually I was doing a report on Venezuelan influence and I asked around about
                    how many Venezuelans there are in Trinidad Tobago and a lot of the Trinidadians
                    would say, “Too many.” There are Venezuelans working with some of the oil
                    companies in Trinidad and Tobago. There are various businesses there and there
                    are a lot of people with Hispanic surnames because at one point they brought
                    people over from Venezuela I think to revive the chocolate industry to try to
                    get them to plant cacao and so forth. They had fairly healthy industries in
                    cacao and coffee but after the discovery of petroleum and the fact that
                    petroleum kind of took over everything, the roads were allowed to deteriorate
                    and younger people don't want to work in agriculture very much so it kind of
                    died out.</p>
                <p>The traditional split now, although there are some people of Venezuelan descent,
                    people of French descent and so forth, is about 40% African descent and 40%
                    Indian and the way it kind of falls out is that the Indians, the Syrians and the
                    Lebanese are large players in business and industry and so forth. The Indians
                    tend to be professionals, maybe in finance, attorneys, doctors, communications
                    and so forth and the people of African descent tend to gravitate more toward the
                    government. They will be the backbone of the police, the military, the
                    government bureaucracy and so forth.</p>
                <p>In our embassy we had people of African descent and Indian descent working
                    together. You will find that in many businesses. Between individuals, there is
                    no overt hostility but I think when it is time to socialize, they tend to stick
                    with their own groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there a split between Trinidad and Tobago?</hi>
                </p>

                <p>CUSHING: A little bit. Tobago was kind of added to the federation rather late. It
                    belonged to the French and the Dutch, various people and it is more oriented
                    toward tourism. It's a much smaller island, doesn't have much petroleum or
                    anything and it has partially autonomous status in that there is a Tobago House
                    of Assembly so they have a little bit of say over local laws and legislation and
                    so forth but anything involving taxation, finance, defense, foreign affairs,
                    they have to defer to Trinidad. Tobago has about 6% of the total population. Its
                    major sources of income are transfers of government money from Trinidad and a
                    certain amount of tourism. The beaches are better on Tobago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any big cruise ships come in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: Cruise ships come in to Port of Spain. Tobago is more package tours from
                    England and Germany and so forth; an international flight will fly directly into
                    the airport in Tobago and offload.</p>
                <p>The cruise ships that come in to Port of Spain tend to come in during the day and
                    the people go and look around Port of Spain and so forth and then hop on the
                    ship that night and then they sail away either that night or the next
                    morning.</p>
                <p>Trinidad itself does not have much tourism, except for carnival; the diaspora in
                    Canada and the U.S. and England comes back for carnival. You've got a fair
                    amount of foreign tourists for carnival but apart from that, it's got some great
                    hiking in the mountains, it's got a very good nature center which has good bird
                    watching but it doesn't seem to have wide appeal for tourists. You get these
                    very small niches; serious bird watchers will come down to this nature center
                    which is a converted cocoa plantation which is up in the mountains where there
                    is a large number of birds and people will come up there and stay for several
                    days and they'll come from China, Germany, U.S., any number of places if they
                    are really dedicated bird watchers. Other than that, people if they are in the
                    country, will do things like go on the swamp boat tour to see the scarlet ibis
                    or they will go out to the beach to watch the leatherback turtles coming in to
                    lay their eggs. That's pretty much it. The preponderance of the tourism is on
                    Tobago and they also say that they probably should be doing more to be
                    competitive with a lot of the other Caribbean islands.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there quite recently?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: I did, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what are you going to do?</hi>
                </p>

                <p>CUSHING: I took the retirement seminar and the jobs search program. I am wrapping
                    up the job search program and my plan now is to move out to Albuquerque, New
                    Mexico. I established contact with an old friend there. We are planning to build
                    a house out there in the desert next spring. She will be retiring at the end of
                    December and we are going to build a house and I am hoping to start a big
                    vegetable garden. I am also looking for some work but it sort of depends on what
                    sort of work and whether I can do it from out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sounds great. Well, thank you very much. This has been
                        very interesting. You certainly moved around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: That I have. I never really established a home bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's always a problem but at the same time it means you
                        get to see things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CUSHING: This is true.</p>
