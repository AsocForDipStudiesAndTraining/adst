                <p>SIDNEY SOBER</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: February 21, 1990</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if we could start off by getting a little of your
                        background. Where did you come from before you got into foreign
                        service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: Well, I guess like almost all foreign service officers who came in just
                    after the war, I had been in the military during the war—as a naval reserve
                    officer out in the Pacific. Before that I had graduated from the City College of
                    New York in 1939.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What had you majored in at CCNY?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: I majored in French, and I had thought that maybe I would teach French.
                    But I had decided before I got out of college, that I would not. Actually I went
                    to Bermuda in early 1941 to work for the Army as a civilian under the
                    destroyers-for-bases deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the famous 40 destroyers for bases.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: I went into the Navy from Bermuda and then came back and took the Foreign
                    Service Exam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you came into the Foreign Service when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: About August 1st, 1947.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a class then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>SOBER: Yes, there was. This was the result of the written exam of December of
                    '46. I think that was the second of these exams which were restricted to people
                    who were veterans, who had served during the war. The process was much faster
                    then. We took the exam in December and we had orals within several months. I was
                    of a class of forty that came in at the beginning of August 1947.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe your class? Who was in your class, and
                        how did you view what you'd be doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: We came from all over. Looking at the list of people who have already
                    given you an interview, Hermann Eilts is one those. Arch Blood is another on
                    your list. They were in my class. I am now working with several others who are
                    also at the State Department doing some post-career work.</p>
                <p>If there was anything that characterized us, and we certainly came from different
                    backgrounds, and different parts of the country, I'd say that it was an idealist
                    approach. Having been through a war and the euphoria of victory, and with a hope
                    about how the world might be; that we might somehow contribute something
                    positively to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of training did you get?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: There was simply an indoctrination program, orientation program. I think
                    it lasted about three or four weeks. It mainly focused on things such as the
                    immigration and naturalization act. Nothing really substantive on diplomacy.
                    Nothing on international law, nothing on economics, nothing on political
                    analysis. You were supposed to go out and pick that up on the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then your first assignment was a rather unusual one. I've
                        never run across anybody assigned there. Where you assigned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: I was assigned to Tananarive, Madagascar. I think that was perhaps the
                    result of the effort which they used to make, asking where would you like to go.
                    Since I had majored in French, spent my junior year of college in Paris, and
                    knew French quite well, I put down France, and I suppose 30 to 40% of the others
                    did too, among the three places I wanted to go. I can only think that, well they
                    figured Madagascar is a French colony, which it was at the time, and therefore
                    that's pretty close to France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of post did you go to and what was it like?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>SOBER: It was an interesting first post. Absolutely unknown to us. In fact, when
                    at our so-called graduation ceremony, at the Foreign Service Institute, my name
                    was announced and they said, you're for Tananarive, I wasn't quite sure where it
                    was although I guessed that it was Madagascar. But I went quickly to the map and
                    found it was.</p>
                <p>It was a good place to be for a foreign service officer just beginning at that
                    time. It was a two-man post. It was led by a consul general, an old time foreign
                    service officer who had been alone for at least a year by the time we got there,
                    at the end of '47. He'd been waiting a long time for an assistant. Within about
                    two or three months of our arrival, he took off on a much delayed home leave and
                    left us in charge of the post, which was fun for a young fledgling foreign
                    service officer—for example to be in charge of post on the Fourth of July and
                    have to give a welcoming talk to the people who had been invited to the
                    consulate for the July Fourth party and things like that. But also it was a
                    rather interesting situation in that a rebellion, a native rebellion, was in
                    effect against the French. It started some time before we got there and went on
                    for another number of months, making for a rather interesting political
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe the political situation on Madagascar.
                        It was a French colony at that time. What was the situation during the
                        immediate post-war period, and what was the situation during the war.
                        Because the French colonies were all sort of going in different
                        directions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: It was French and stayed French throughout the war. It was far away from
                    the middle east. It wasn't the situation such as you had in the middle east. I
                    think “colony” was not exactly the name for it by the time we got there. I think
                    it was called an overseas territory, slightly different, but basically a colony.
                    It was under a French high commissioner, a man who had been a senior army
                    officer during the war, Pierre de Chevigne, who had been fairly close to De
                    Gaulle.</p>
                <p>The French were in charge and that was it. They ran everything and were in charge
                    of everything. The French colonists, who had been there for years, were really
                    the power brokers among the civilian elements. The Malagasies, even among the
                    most evolved, the Hova group, were definitely in the back seat. Although there
                    was this rebellion, the rebellion was not noticeable in Tananarive. It was out
                    in the bush country especially, in the eastern part of the country. The French
                    were rather harsh and eventually effective in putting it down.</p>
                <p>So you had really a colonial situation, where you could not hear the voice of the
                    Malagasies.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just interviewed yesterday a man who was assigned just
                        about this time to the Gold Coast, now Ghana. He said that they were under
                        instructions, don't report on the political situation and don't contact the
                        natives, the blacks, at all outside that of the servant/master relationship.
                        What were your instructions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: The instructions were nil. That was rather nice. Maybe it would have been
                    helpful, but I don't recall that we ever got any substantial guideline from the
                    department or from Paris. We reported, in a way, to Embassy Paris, although our
                    messages went directly to Washington, with copies to Paris. There was some
                    interest in the rebellion, but it was far away from the United States and I
                    don't recall much interest. A few times, they said, yes, that's interesting,
                    what you're reporting. The interest was largely commercial: cloves, vanilla,
                    some coffee came from Madagascar. Some mica was exported from there. It was not
                    very important, except for the few companies who had a stake, especially in the
                    spices area. Maybe that led up to a situation where it was deemed necessary to
                    have an outpost, that far away, but I got the impression that people really
                    didn't pay much attention to want to worry about what we were doing. We were
                    left pretty well alone, which may reflect that they were satisfied with what we
                    did, but more or less, didn't care very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It still seems to be pretty much the case.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: As for Madagascar, well I don't know. Of course they had a big change.
                    About 1960 they became independent. I have not followed it closely. It is well
                    off the main stream of global events.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you moved to some place which was much more in the
                        main stream. You were in Tananarive from 1947-49 and then you were
                        transferred to Prague.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: It was a direct transfer, and we arrived in the spring of '49. That was
                    somewhat more than a year after the communists had taken over in Prague. It was
                    difficult and fascinating. It was a time when the communists were tightening the
                    screws in all aspects of the scene. It was virtually impossible to strike up any
                    sort of social acquaintance with any of the Czechs because of their concern of
                    police supervision. There was lots of talk about being sent to the uranium mines
                    that they were said to be developing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a sort of Siberia.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>SOBER: Within Czechoslovakia, that's right. People had their properties taken
                    over, of course. All the businesses were being nationalized. And if you met
                    someone at some sort of a diplomatic or state occasion, a Czech, it was not
                    possible to say, come to my house, not possible from the point of view of their
                    safety. So that once in a while you would arrange to meet someone at a corner
                    downtown, join up and walk along the street, hoping that the man you were with
                    would not be identified and would not be followed. It was a real police state
                    that was tightening the screws all the time. On the other hand, there was a
                    great deal of interest back in the United States at what was happening as part
                    of the clamp down of Eastern Europe. It was a very interesting place to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of work were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: I was still a young, junior foreign service officer so that I had a series
                    of rotational jobs. I started out with consular work and that was very
                    interesting in a way because one of the things I was doing was reviewing visa
                    applications from Czechs who were anxious to get out, and then there were
                    questions as to whether they had collaborated during the war or things like
                    that. Later on when I saw Gian Carlo Menotti's The Consul, it brought home to me
                    some of the terror.</p>
                <p>I did some administrative work and then I did some economic work, a variety of
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your ambassador at that time was Ellis Briggs, for most of
                        the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: Ellis came while we were there. Our first ambassador was Joseph Jacobs. He
                    was transferred to Rome, not as ambassador, and he was replaced by Ellis
                    Briggs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ellis Briggs, is one of the more interesting characters in
                        the foreign service. His son is an ambassador now, but this was Ellis O.
                        Briggs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: Yes, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you describe his method of operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>SOBER: Ellis was a delightful person. We didn't get to know him that well because
                    we only stayed at that post about a year. We got caught up during Ellis' tenure
                    in the very tight squeeze by the Czech government during which, within a couple
                    of weeks, the embassy was reduced by two-thirds and slightly later by another
                    fraction. It was cut down very sharply. Thus we didn't really get to know him
                    very well. On the other hand, because I knew French well, he had me come along
                    on a couple of introductory calls on ambassadors where French was going to be
                    the medium of discussion and he asked me, for example, because I'd picked up a
                    few words of Czech, to accompany our public affairs officer, Joe Kolarek, to the
                    border when Joe was declared persona non grata, and had to leave in haste. We
                    got enough of a feel for Ellis Briggs although we did not get to know him at all
                    intimately. I must say he was my ideal of what an ambassador should be and was.
                    He was very concerned about his staff which was all to the good. He was a
                    professional in every way and he knew when to be tough and to be satirical
                    towards the regime, and I think when to play a more tactful role when it was
                    something that he wanted to do. I think, we, my small group of junior officers
                    and I think the embassy, at large, looked up to him as a very fine fellow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there during the attack on South Korea, and the
                        development of NATO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: We were there at the beginning of NATO but not as long as June 1950 and
                    South Korea. At that time, we had already left, had to go out with the
                    two-thirds efflux from the embassy as a result of the clamp down by the Czechs
                    who made the demand that we reduce.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about the “Soviet” menace. Was there the
                        feeling that you were on the wrong side of an imminent attack on western
                        Europe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: No, I don't think so. This was 1949-50 and obviously the Cold War was in
                    effect. Czechoslovakia had been one of the first steps of the communization of
                    eastern Europe. We knew there was a problem and we felt it in the limitations on
                    the way we could operate and the contacts and all that, as I've mentioned. But I
                    think at that time the supremacy of the United States in terms of military
                    prowess as well as political and economic strength was such that I don't recall
                    ever being concerned that there was going to be an attack through Czechoslovakia
                    on to West Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then after two rather isolated posts, you got another. You
                        went to Iceland, Reykjavik, where you were from 1950 to 1952. Was the direct
                        transfer a result from this clamp down in Czechoslovakia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>SOBER: It was a direct transfer, punctuated by home leave. But it was a transfer
                    that had been unexpected in as much as we stayed in Czechoslovakia only for
                    about a year, for the reasons we mentioned.</p>
                <p>I drove our car from Prague to Paris while my wife stayed behind with our two
                    very young children. The Briggs' put them up for a week before they joined me in
                    Paris. It was in Paris that we got the word that we were transferred to Iceland,
                    which was somewhat of a shock. I had been persuaded by our association with
                    Ellis Briggs, that Latin America would be a good place to be because that's
                    where he'd spent much of his career. And I think when we were evacuated from
                    Czechoslovakia and we were asked where we'd like to go, as I recall it although
                    it might not be in the correct order, for where I'd like to go I put Buenos
                    Aires, Montevideo and Santiago de Chile. So when we were told we were going to
                    Iceland, it was a bit of an abrupt shock.</p>
                <p>But we went. And that too, yes, was isolated in a way but quite different. After
                    all, it was part of NATO, and was western Europe, although geographically
                    isolated. To me it was a very interesting professional challenge. I was sent
                    there as an economic officer, but for the two years that I was there, a good
                    part of the second year, I was doing political work. I was still quite a junior
                    officer, and lo and behold, for a couple of periods but at least for a month at
                    one time, I was elevated to be Charg� d'affaires. It was then a legation; it had
                    not yet been raised to an embassy. For a young officer, that was interesting.
                    For example, I was Charg� at a time when our air base at Keflavik was
                    reactivated in 1952.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This had been a base during World War II, a very important
                        base as far as the ferrying of aircraft to England and also anti-submarine
                        patrols. But it had fallen into what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: It had been a civilian airport but we negotiated a bilateral agreement
                    with the Icelandic government which was a member of NATO although it did not
                    have, and still does not have, any military force of its own. It was
                    exhilarating, if you will, for a young and inexperienced foreign service officer
                    to go in the legation's car, with the American flag flying, down to Keflavik to
                    greet the Air Force General who was coming in to open the base.</p>
                <p>It was very interesting to be there. Then, and to some extent now, it had an
                    interesting political situation in that about 20% of the popular vote in the
                    national elections went communist. Within the NATO context, that was a pretty
                    interesting situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation in Iceland at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>SOBER: Basically, you had conservatives who had been in charge almost all of the
                    time. But you had some social democrats, some agricultural elements and the
                    communist elements all vying for power. A very literate society. Illiteracy was
                    totally unknown. We used to be told at the time, I think perhaps it was true,
                    that Iceland had the highest book purchasing per capita in the world. It was
                    extremely clean. My wife never had to worry about any dirt around our two
                    infants. The water was very clean. Everything was spotless. It was a little
                    tough to get used to the very short days in the winter and a little difficult to
                    get around, outside Iceland, of course. But from a professional point of view,
                    the types of things I had to do and the political situation were of interest.
                    And after the base was reopened, the concerns that the Icelanders had, not to
                    have their social system, their culture, diluted in any way by having too much
                    outside exposure, was pretty obvious to us in the embassy. The Icelanders were
                    very concerned about the number of GIs who would be allowed to come to
                    Reykjavik, about twenty miles away, how many GIs should be allowed to come into
                    Reykjavik at any one time. We had to have negotiations with them to make sure
                    not too many would come at any one time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a problem with the Air Force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: No, they understood very well. Certainly it was not a problem with any of
                    the leaders that I experienced. I think they understood that they had an
                    interest in being there and surely they had an interest in seeing that their men
                    had a chance at some decent liberty time. But they were quite sensitive to the
                    concerns of Icelanders. I think there were incidents, once or twice, but never
                    were they blown up into anything serious.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about dealing with Icelandic government? Were they
                        difficult to deal with.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: No, they were very open. The base question was the major political issue
                    we had to deal with them on. They were careful in protecting their rights. But
                    they were not difficult to deal with. In terms of economic information, there
                    weren't many secrets that they would be concerned about. Their major concern was
                    fish and their major problem during the time we were there was the so called cod
                    war, with the British, in particular with the British trawlers coming too close
                    to their land. They were worried about over fishing and there was a little
                    political dust-up but this didn't affect the United States very much because we
                    didn't have any fishing boats up along those waters.</p>

                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>SOBER: Literate, not extremist, or fanatic. Certainly did not go in for violence.
                    They tried to play a rather sophisticated advanced type of political game. They
                    had a paper which was read pretty widely. I remember having conversations with
                    some of the communist leaders from time to time. You could have a rational
                    conversation with them, not in terms of getting them to change their minds, but
                    in terms of their sometimes legitimate concerns and grievances over some of the
                    problems there. But they played within the rules as far as I could see.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SOBER: McCarthy peaked a little bit after we were there. We left in August of
                    1952. Well, there was a concern. It was a country in NATO, and obviously, should
                    the communists have come to power it would have been a serious problem. They
                    never did come to power while we were there. They did form an alliance later on
                    but they never had power. It was a legitimate concern but it didn't cause any
                    frantic worries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 1952 and you went and had some

                <p>SOBER: Yes, I was assigned to Northwestern University for economic training.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you decided that that was your bag?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: I worked into it. There was nothing like the cone system that we have now.
                    You were not assigned to any particular functional area, as I recall. But I had
                    done economic work; I had done some in Prague, a good deal in Iceland. The way
                    it worked was, the personnel people in Washington decided that it seemed like a
                    good thing, and they proposed, somewhat unexpectedly to me, that I go back and
                    take advanced economic training at Northwestern. I was somewhat uncertain about
                    that, but I agreed, and we had a very pleasant year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you were assigned from 1953 to 1956 in Ankara,
                        Turkey. Was that at your request.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: No. I don't recall what I had requested. Well, I take it back. At
                    Northwestern, I did a paper or two relating to eastern Europe, and as I recall
                    it, my memory may not serve me right, I had the idea of going back there. As it
                    turned out there was a job in Helsinki as a senior economic officer, and I
                    thought maybe I would go there. This was the McCarthy period. Fortunately I was
                    not involved with that but there were delays all over, and I was assigned to
                    Ankara. Again this was one of those things where the headquarters people in
                    their overall wisdom had decided what was good.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>I had no complaint about that. In fact, we looked forward to our stay in Turkey,
                    and we enjoyed our stay there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain how the embassy worked at that time? How
                        Avra Warren, the ambassador, operated at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: Avra Warren was a very experienced foreign service officer, knowing in the
                    ways of working abroad. I don't think Warren ever had a senior job in
                    Washington, but he came from Pakistan to Turkey and went to Finland, later
                    on.</p>
                <p>He was very much in charge. He knew what was going on. I've seen this in recent
                    years even more than then, in terms of how he had run the embassy in Pakistan,
                    through work that I've been doing, reviewing documents for the Foreign Relations
                    of the United States series covering the time he was ambassador in Pakistan.</p>
                <p>Very much in charge. When he was in Turkey, one of the interesting things that
                    happened was the development of our collective security network in Asia. Turkey
                    was already in NATO and we had established a close relationship with Turkey.
                    During the time we were there you had the Turco-Iraqi Pact in 1955 which
                    developed into the Baghdad Pact, to which Iran, Pakistan and the United Kingdom
                    adhered. Turkey was a key element in that collective security network because it
                    was the link between the collective security system eastward toward Asia and
                    westward toward NATO. So we had a very deep interest in Turkey, a close
                    relationship, and a large aid program which was not without troubles, because
                    the Turks were always running into some serious problems and always wanted more
                    aid than we were able or willing to provide.</p>
                <p>But Warren was much in charge of what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were an economic officer. Was there someone above
                        you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: Yes, the economic section followed a line that was different from the
                    norm, but it was a line that was being pushed at that time, very shortly after
                    we arrived. (We and the Warrens arrived at just about the same time; in fact we
                    crossed over by ship with Mrs. Warren, and Warren came along soon after). It was
                    decided that the economic section of the embassy would merge with the economic
                    aid mission, which was not AID at the time, but ICA or something. The economic
                    counselor, Owen Jones, who was my immediate boss, was made the deputy economic
                    aid mission director. We were housed in the economic aid building rather than
                    the new embassy chancery itself.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Now we were part of the embassy. We attended embassy staff meetings. Nevertheless
                    there was something of a link through the aid mission. I think that was all
                    right. Some of it was justified. Some of us were a little uneasy and thought we
                    were being pushed aside a little more than was called for. But I don't recall
                    that it inhibited the reporting that I was doing. I was doing economic and
                    financial reporting, had good contacts, and I never had any undue pressure from
                    anyone from the aid mission to tailor my reporting along the lines that they
                    would have liked. I don't think it made that much difference one way or
                    another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you go about doing this economic and political
                        reporting. What were you interested in and why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: Well, on the financial side, they were running into financial problems.
                    They had large arrears in paying their bills and that was a serious political
                    issue and caused some heartburn. They felt that the United States was being
                    unduly negative in giving in to their desires. We, for example, insisted that
                    they take on some policy reforms to improve their situation.</p>
                <p>The nature of the arrears and what they were doing in their domestic situation
                    obviously impacted on their external situation. I had great contacts at their
                    treasury department, the finance ministry, and used to get a lot of information
                    and report it. That was of continuing interest.And we dealt in other things.
                    Their investment law, petroleum exploration and things like that. We did try to
                    coordinate with the people in the aid mission who were obviously interested in
                    macroeconomic things, and complemented what they did and benefited from some of
                    the information that they were getting also.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view, from your perspective, the Turkish
                        government at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: The Turkish government was under Adnan Menderes, the Prime Minister. He
                    was the leader of the Democratic Party which had come into office in 1950 when
                    the Republican Party under General Ismet Inonu was defeated. Inonu stayed as the
                    major opposition leader.</p>
                <p>Menderes was a strong man with very strong ideas. He very much supported Turkey's
                    membership in NATO, very much valued and depended upon the relationship with the
                    United States. Of course it was a very strong point in US/Turkish relations,
                    although we had some troubles with him and President Celal Bayar, on the
                    question on economic assistance. They thought we were being miserly, and we
                    thought we were being realistic and helpful by insisting that certain things be
                    done. By and large the relationship was cooperative.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>Now there were some uneasy developments in terms of Menderes' desire to stay in
                    power. I left in 1956 and it was about three or four years later that he was
                    overthrown by the army and later executed for his internal political excesses.
                    That was several years after we left but there were signs even when we were
                    there that serious troubles were possible. He was too hard a political infighter
                    and tried to make sure that the opposition did not have a fair chance. There
                    were signs of this. But I would say until the time we left, in the middle of
                    1956, these concerns were not very severe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you view Turkey. Did you think that it was always
                        going to need assistance or were we going to be able to turn it into a
                        strong self-sufficient country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: I'm trying to recall my state of mind at that time, 34 years ago. Turkey
                    was somewhat an undeveloped country but clearly was looking towards the west in
                    terms of its economic outlook. I'm not talking about social systems in the bush
                    where people were sometimes subsistence farmers, but by and large, the national
                    outlook, such as it was, was towards the west.</p>
                <p>Geographically they might be in the Middle East, but tied to NATO, they
                    considered themselves part of Europe only a small piece of land, where Istanbul
                    is, is in Europe. But they were looking that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is reflective of Ataturk's attitude, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: Sure, he was a great reformer who had done, to my mind, some marvelous
                    things under the circumstances he faced. They were rather modernistic in their
                    outward approach, although they had an enormous distance to go. They were
                    producing good amounts of food. They could feed themselves. And they had
                    intelligent people and they were very trainable people. I could see that they
                    had a long way to go and that they would not be a major world economic power but
                    they could make it themselves, at a low, but an increasingly good, level of
                    subsistence for their people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I served in Greece 15 years later and everything seemed to
                        center around the terrible Turk. How much did Greeks entered into the
                        Turkish psyche.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: Much less than Turkey figured in the Greek psyche. Much less. That's a
                    factor of difference in size. Turkey was and is more confident of itself and its
                    great concerns are other than its relations with Greece. Although that's a
                    serious problem, sometimes a serious irritant.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>When we were there there were some terrible incidents of violence against Greek
                    communities both in Istanbul and Izmir. That was 1955 as I recall. Basically
                    this was over Cyprus. I remember the slogan of the day was, Kibris Turktur
                    (”Cyprus is Turk”). So you did have that problem, and there were very
                    unfortunate incidents in the mid fifties. But by and large that was not
                    something Turkey was mainly worried about.</p>
                <p>I could see the difference in Greece. Afterward I worked back in the Department
                    on this area. I was there at the time of the Colonels Revolt, and I was in
                    regional affairs.</p>
                <p>The Greeks, by their size, have much more to be concerned about with Turkey, than
                    Turkey, with its size, has to be concerned with Greece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question on this. How did you find the
                        relationship between the embassy and the consulate general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: I don't remember any disputes, or serious differences of any type, between
                    what we were doing in Istanbul and in Ankara. I went to visit Istanbul every now
                    and again. I remember, coming back to this question about Greece that you
                    mentioned, going down in September of '55 to the annual meeting of the IMF and
                    World Bank which happened to be held, that year, in Istanbul. It was very soon
                    after these very mean events had taken place. I remember going to the university
                    where the bank fund meetings were going to be held and the outside circle was
                    ringed with tanks because there was sort of a martial law situation.</p>
                <p>I went down and collaborated with our people in Istanbul. If there were any
                    troubles between us, they never came to my attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Ankara in 1956 and you went to INR, Intelligence
                        and Research, and you were there from 1956 to 60. That's a fairly solid
                        stint. What were your concerns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: They varied. First of all, Wristonization had occurred.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what that was?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>SOBER: There was a man, I believe he was president of Brown University, Henry
                    Wriston. He was called in by John Foster Dulles to examine the organization of
                    the State Department, and he focused on the division between foreign service and
                    civil service in the State Department in the organization of personnel. As a
                    result of his investigations, a program called Wristonization was put into
                    effect, which sought to diminish very strongly the division between foreign
                    service and civil service, so that many jobs in Washington, in the State
                    Department, which had been held by civil service people were designated as
                    foreign service positions, to be filled by foreign service people. And civil
                    service officers within the department were given the option of joining the
                    foreign service, which they were allowed to do, at equivalent salaries, going
                    over into foreign service categories and titles, or staying on but being told
                    that if they stayed on in the civil service, their chances of promotion to any
                    more important jobs were going to be very seriously reduced.</p>
                <p>As this happened there was a need to fill many of the jobs in Washington that had
                    been filled always by civil service people, not foreign service people. And when
                    I was ripe to come home from Turkey, there was a fairly large move of foreign
                    service people into jobs, such as in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research,
                    which had been almost entirely been filled by civil service people. So that's
                    how that particular job happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I served in INR about five years later. It seems to me
                        that if there is one place where a civil servant would be better than a
                        foreign service officer it would be INR. Some one who really knows the
                        country rather than someone who sort of pops in and they may bring in
                        experience from the field which may be important on the desk, but in INR you
                        want depth of knowledge. Did you find this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: Sure, and this is underlined by the assignment I was given, when I first
                    got to INR. I was assigned to be the person dealing with economic work in the
                    Northeast Asia part of INR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's Japan and Korea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: Yes, Japan and Korea. I had been to Japan on my destroyer at the end of
                    the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Doing what you could to destroy the Japanese economy

                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>SOBER: But I had never been there before in any professional work. And I found
                    myself having to learn, and I had zero to begin with. Well, I stayed there a
                    year and a half. I was given a trip of about a month, going to Korea and Japan.
                    I worked hard at it and I think I learned something. But your point is
                    absolutely right. I had no depth, no historical perspective. I'm sure there was
                    a loss there. However, I didn't mind it very much. It was out of the mainstream
                    but it was interesting to me. After about a year and a half, as I recall it, the
                    effective head of INR, not the top man, but the man in charge of research
                    activity, Alan Evans, asked me, to my great surprise, if I would like to shift
                    from Northeast Asia to become the branch chief for South Asia. Well, I had never
                    considered that and I said, give me a day to think about it, and then I thought
                    about it and talked about it with my wife. And I said, okay.</p>
                <p>Well, that was a turning point in my life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what South Asia was in State Department
                        terms?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: South Asia is a term of ours which geographically could be better defined
                    as South Central Asia. It refers to what we call the Indo-Pakistani
                    subcontinent, going from Afghanistan in the west through what is now Bangladesh
                    and the eastern-most parts of India on the east, from Nepal and Kashmir in the
                    north to Sri Lanka and the Maldives in the south.</p>
                <p>I said that was a turning point in my career and life. I did accept the job,
                    because although I knew virtually nothing about India, it did seem like an
                    interesting place, and I've never ever regretted it. Alan Evans is no longer
                    with us but he certainly changed our lives, because my career, to a large
                    extent, turned then to South Asia. To the extent I still have a career, I am
                    still deeply involved with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our interest in that area. We're talking about
                        the time you were in INR in the late fifties.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: As always, since World War II and only coming to an end now, our major
                    interest was the Cold War. I had mentioned earlier the formation of the Baghdad
                    Pact that included Pakistan, and by the time I started working, in 1957, on
                    South Asia, the Baghdad Pact was going. We had a very important relationship,
                    for that area, with Pakistan both in military and economic terms. Vis-a-vis
                    India, our concern more than anything at that particular time, was its
                    nonalignment policy and growing relationship with the USSR. The Soviets had
                    rather effectively come through a window of opportunity that had been opened by
                    our allying with Pakistan. And so there was a concern, whither India and which
                    way was Mr. Nehru going to go, and it was an interesting time. You had problems
                    everywhere from the middle east across the whole swath of southern Asia into
                    Southeast Asia. You had a growing American interest. It was not vital at the
                    time, but it was of growing importance in the context of the Cold War.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you saw it then, what was the Eisenhower policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: I must say that in addition to the work I did then, I have the added
                    perspective I've got by having had to review major documentation on the area
                    which how has been published in the Foreign Relations of the United States in
                    the Volume for 1955-57 which came out last year. The Eisenhower view of the area
                    was in the Cold War context - How is this area going to figure in this
                    confrontation that we had with the Soviet Union and its friends including at
                    that time Communist China.</p>
                <p>The Baghdad Pact was there. In early 1957, you had the Eisenhower Doctrine, a
                    joint resolution going through Congress which said that we had a very high
                    interest in the Middle East region and that we would use any means necessary,
                    including force, in cooperating with countries of the region who were threatened
                    by countries controlled by international communism. It was the Cold War that was
                    the ruling directive for our concerns in the whole area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view Pakistan as being a member of CENTO.
                        There's talk that the British brought them in in order to get us
                        involved.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: I don't think that's true. It's true that our outlook, the northern tier
                    concept, we did develop in collaboration with the British. Of course Pakistan
                    was part of the old British empire of India. India was known to the British far
                    better than it was to us. But by the time this was taking place, we're talking
                    1954, 55, 56, the British influence was not nearly what it had been. We were
                    playing an increasing and what became the major role in that area, too.</p>
                <p>Pakistan. We didn't have to bring Pakistan in. Pakistan was very glad to come in.
                    They had a bit of concern, but they were glad to come in. Basically Pakistan
                    wanted to have some very powerful friends and the American superpower would be
                    number one to help Pakistan build itself against what it saw as its primary
                    foreign threat. And that was India. It was not the Soviet Union or Communist
                    China, which were the great threats which the northern tier concept and the
                    Baghdad Pact and the collective security across Asia were concerned about.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>So we and Pakistan had different views about the primary threat. However it
                    served the purposes of both countries to have an alliance. (Actually our only
                    formal alliance was through the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization of which we
                    were both members; we never officially joined the Baghdad Pact). But we looked
                    on Pakistan as an important element in this collective security system, in that
                    it was a fairly large country, believed to have a good military tradition, and
                    willing to sign up, if you will, on the western, free world, side. That was good
                    enough for us.At the same time, for Pakistan, I'm not suggesting that they liked
                    the Communists, but that was not their major concern. Their major concern was
                    India. And it served their purpose, very clearly, to receive American military
                    equipment and political support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you view Nehru and India at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: It's hard for me to talk about “at that time.” We have worked on the
                    region for such a long time. We had a chance to meet Nehru, briefly, when we
                    were living in India. And read a lot of stuff about him before and since that
                    time. I may not be able to say just how I viewed him in the late fifties, before
                    we went to live in south Asia for the first time.</p>
                <p>One of the good things about INR, coming to South Asia as I had from Northeast
                    Asia, without any academic or other background—one of the great things about
                    INR, and I would say that this is still true for foreign service people, is that
                    since you're divorced from the hubbub of overnight operational traffic, and rush
                    deadlines on everything, you do have time to do some reading. I did do a great
                    deal of reading over the period of several years. And I read things that Nehru
                    had written, speeches, books. And I must say I had come to a very considerable
                    admiration for the man's intellectual ability. And I'll tell you now, that I
                    still think he's one of the great statesmen of the 20th century although, like
                    others, he didn't do everything quite right.He was certainly the leading
                    statesman of South Asia. A man who had projected himself on the world scene and
                    made an impact. A man who founded, with Tito and Nasser, the nonaligned
                    movement. A man who had a certain self-respect for himself and his country, who
                    demanded India be given a position to which he believed, because of its ancient
                    civilization and culture, and its size, it was entitled. Now that type of
                    attitude brought some troubles in his relationship with the United States.
                    Because we had not yet found ourselves able to deal with these far-away people
                    who wanted to be seen as self-confident and respectable and able to get equal
                    treatment from us.</p>
                <p>I think this is still a major problem in India/US relationships. Sometimes when
                    I'm lecturing to my students, I call this the Rodney Dangerfield syndrome. The
                    Indians want respect and don't think the US gives it to them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Foster Dulles seemed to have the attitude, if you're not
                        for us, you're against us. And particularly with this non aligned movement.
                        Did this permeate INR and other places or did you feel that those dealing
                        with those places were saying, well yes but... there are other things to be
                        considered and you might pay lip service to this idea. Or were you pretty
                        much on board with Dulles at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: I don't recall the sense that we were taken over by Dulles or by anyone
                    else. It's more complicated than that. Dulles was expressing opinions that were
                    not peculiar only to Dulles. It was a Cold War and there was the feeling that
                    the United States was somewhat threatened. There was the feeling that we'd like
                    people to at least be friendly to us if not allies. There was a concern about
                    India.</p>
                <p>If I can jump ahead, I think that still is a problem. In my experience throughout
                    the years, I found a lot of people in the government and the United States at
                    large, who look upon India with askance at their foreign connections and their
                    trends in their thinking of where they are in the world. So it was not just a
                    question of Dulles. As you said, yes at one point, Dulles did feel what you
                    said, if you're not with us, you're against us. But I think we have matured well
                    beyond that point to respecting a different view which does not necessarily say
                    that they're “agin” us.</p>
                <p>No, in INR, certainly when I became the chief of the South Asia branch, there was
                    no bias against India because of Dulles. There may have been some feelings that
                    India was not doing everything that we thought it should be doing for ultimately
                    its own good. But no, I don't think there was any bias. On the contrary, and
                    this is what INR should be doing, we tried to provide a rather independent, and
                    objective, and if you will, impartial (given the fact that we are Americans),
                    view of events and analyses and outlook to policy people. I would say that we
                    did not do too badly. I think that there was a recognition that the American
                    Cold War approach in that part of the world, as in the northern tier, with the
                    alliance and the strong military supply relationship with Pakistan, had
                    alienated India and Nehru because they quite properly saw what Pakistan's main
                    concern was. It was India and not the Soviet threat. The Indians warned us and
                    complained to us about this and it led to, as I mentioned before, a window of
                    opportunity for the Soviets which they seized and have used very astutely since
                    the mid-fifties toward what is today a very strong military supply relationship
                    with India. I think in INR we recognized that and we were aware of what
                    Pakistan's main interest was, although in the Cold War context, our major policy
                    leaders were not concerned with regional events as much as global events such as
                    in the Cold War. So they were not too concerned about the regional ramifications
                    of our military supply arrangements with Pakistan, but were much more concerned
                    in having a reliable friend in Pakistan in the Cold War context.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were dealing with that in 1958. How about the events
                        that led to the Baghdad Pact blowing apart. Qasim killed off the king and
                        then N. Said was lynched. That whole business in Iraq which effectively
                        ended CENTO.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>SOBER: Not really. It took Iraq out of the Baghdad Pact. And then the Baghdad
                    Pact became CENTO. The headquarters moved from Baghdad to Turkey, where it
                    stayed until CENTO died after the revolution in Iran. It didn't really affect
                    the operations of the Baghdad Pact, and then CENTO. We never joined either one,
                    although we were hard pressed by the regional members and by Great Britain,
                    because of Middle Eastern concerns. First of all Iraq was the only Arab country
                    in the alliance. Other Arab countries like Egypt were dead set against Iraq's
                    joining with a western alliance. Then of course there was the question of
                    Israel. How do you deal with Iraq which was and still is one of the steadfast
                    anti-Israel countries. For those reasons we didn't join the Baghdad or the CENTO
                    Pact. We were officially observers. However, in effect we were full-time
                    members. In effect. We took our turn hosting the ministerial meetings annually,
                    we were members of all the committees, we took part in joint military exercises.
                    We were, to all intents and purposes, accepted, except for signing on the line,
                    as members of CENTO. It did not change very much after the departure of Iraq,
                    because it did not very much affect our view of the “threat”. There was still
                    the Sino/Soviet threat at that particular time, which continued.</p>
                <p>So we went along with the transfer from Iraq to Turkey of the headquarters.
                    Actually because we would not or could not join, we entered in March of 1959
                    into identical bilateral executive agreements not only with Pakistan, but with
                    Iran and Turkey who remained as the regional members. And the one with Pakistan
                    is still in effect. It's talked about more since Afghanistan went critical.</p>
                <p>As a substitute for joining CENTO, and under the authority of the Eisenhower
                    doctrine, the Joint Resolution on the Middle East of 1957, we said that in the
                    event of threats we would consult and might use force in accordance with our
                    constitutional processes but limited again by the Eisenhower resolution — in
                    effect, the operative meaning was, if Pakistan were threatened with aggression
                    by a country “controlled by international communism.” That has been a very sore
                    point, in various times in the past, because we did not come to Pakistan's help
                    in 1965 when it found itself in a war with India; nor in 1971 in another war
                    with India. We did not come militarily to Pakistan's help, quite the contrary.
                    Pakistan felt that we had led it down, because we had the '59 agreement. It
                    still is on the books. The point is that they have never been really willing to
                    accept that our limitations under the '59 agreement involve Pakistan's being
                    aggressed upon by a country controlled by international communism. We did not
                    and do not consider India a country controlled by international communism. There
                    the '59 agreement really does not come into force.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left INR in 1960 and you went to Bombay, where you
                        served until 1963. What were you doing and how a consulate general in Bombay
                        operated.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>SOBER: I was sent as the number two in the consulate general with immediate
                    responsibilities for economic work. That was interesting. Bombay, first of all,
                    was, and still is (my wife and I were there just a few months ago) a vibrant
                    city. If you detached Bombay from the hinterland, you might look upon it as,
                    westernized is not the word, but modern in many aspects. With a middle class
                    that you could see fitting into a commercial environment in the west. Obviously
                    there's a lot of poverty, and hovels, but a good part of Bombay gives you a
                    cosmopolitan outlook. A fascinating place that we enjoyed very, very much.
                    People were quite friendly. Economic work was okay because it was and still is
                    the major center for American economic interest. It's where investments are, and
                    a big financial center.</p>
                <p>Relations with our embassy were fine. But varied. Our first ambassador was
                    Ellsworth Bunker, for whom I had the greatest admiration and respect. The next
                    one was Kenneth Galbraith, and a very different person.</p>
                <p>

                        understand there was a tremendous ego there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: I think saying he had a tremendous ego is a considerable
                    understatement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this impact on what you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: No, it didn't really. No, to his credit, never did we have instructions as
                    to what not to do, or what to do. We reported directly to Washington, with
                    copies to New Delhi. I was there, for example, for the Goa takeover in 1961. I
                    was there and happened to be in charge during the whole period of the
                    Sino-Indian War of 1962. That was of considerable interest to the United States.
                    No, I don't recall ever being directed by New Delhi, “do this in a particular
                    way.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Goa takeover. This did not sit very well in
                        the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: No, it did not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened and how were you reporting it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>SOBER: The dispute had been brewing for a long time. Back in late '55, John
                    Foster Dulles had issued a joint statement along with the foreign minister of
                    Portugal who happened to be in the United States, in which there was some
                    reference to Portuguese overseas provinces. The Indians took that very badly and
                    said, oh you're taking the Portuguese position. The Portuguese had been quite
                    adamant about not doing what the French had done, for example, agree to give
                    back their Indian possessions peacefully. So this had been building up.What
                    happened in 1961 was that the Indians got tired of the Portuguese adamancy about
                    not giving up Goa. India organized their military, surrounded the area and
                    claimed that someone had fired on them. They said therefore it required a police
                    action, and in retaliation, they had to go in.</p>
                <p>Well, it was pretty clear that the Indians had decided enough was enough and
                    we're going to finish this off once and for all. And they did it in very short
                    order.</p>
                <p>You're right. This did attract international attention. The American ambassador
                    to the UN was Adlai Stevenson and he had been considered to be very friendly to
                    India. This was the Kennedy period, and Kennedy was also friendly to India. And
                    I think that's why he sent Galbraith there. Another reason he sent Galbraith, I
                    think, is that he was happier to have Galbraith in India than in Washington.</p>
                <p>When Adlai Stevenson took out against the Indian aggression, use of force to
                    achieve a political end, it sent the Indians up the wall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that have any repercussions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: Oh yeah, they were mad at us, but it was passing. Whatever ill will
                    existed because of that was overtaken surely the next year, by the Sino/Indian
                    War. There was a tremendous turnaround, as you recall. There had been trouble
                    building up for six or seven years, with disputes over the borders between China
                    and India in two regions. One in Ladakh and the other in the northeast frontier
                    region.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>The war broke out in 1962. The Chinese thought that they had had enough of
                    threats and disputes with India and thought there was a need for some reaction.
                    They sent their forces over the border. Especially in the northeast the Indians
                    were badly prepared. Krishna Menon, somebody who was not liked in the United
                    States, the minister of defense, was sacked. Lo and behold, Nehru made a
                    180-degree reversal of course and, in panic, called upon Washington and London
                    for military help. Now that's quite a change, since he was the apostle of
                    nonalignment. It was unexpected. Jack Kennedy — of course I was there and not
                    here, but my guess is that he spent not more than five minutes cogitating about
                    how to react to this request. He said go, and we sent some military transport
                    planes from Germany, the closest place, with some things like tents and small
                    arms. Nothing that could really affect the course of the war in these far away,
                    very high altitude places. You're talking about the Himalayas and the foothills.
                    But politically it was a momentous turn of course, in India's position. How did
                    it affect us? Well, at the time I happened to be in charge of our consulate and
                    it was quite a development in our relationship with the Indians. I remember
                    being asked to come sit on the platform at various public meetings, when people
                    were exhorted to do their best, the women were encouraged to throw their gold
                    bangles and bracelets into the war chest. There was a tremendous euphoria
                    regarding US-Indian relations because of Kennedy's willingness to do what we
                    could, which was, in the event, not very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard it said by somebody else whom I interviewed
                        that there has been this perception in the area that when a Republican
                        administration is in the tilt goes to Pakistan, and when a Democratic
                        administration is in, to India. And looking at it I can see a certain amount
                        of validity about it. Is this valid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: This is a fact that is deeply believed in by the people of Pakistan. In
                    fact, also by people in India. And I think, historically, if you check it out,
                    you can support this. I'm not sure this is a result of a deliberate interest or
                    effort by democratic or republican administrations. But that's the way it has
                    worked out. It's a fact of life, in the political map of the subcontinent,
                    certainly as to what they believe and expect.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Part of this is because Republican administrations tend to
                        be a little more hard line towards the confrontation with the Soviet Union.
                        That's changed considerably now. Therefore Pakistan is more interesting than
                        India.</hi>

                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>SOBER: I think you can carry that through to a point where it doesn't work out.
                    For example, Jack Kennedy. Yes, he said, let's help India. He was friendly
                    toward India. He was friendly toward India before he became President. As a
                    senator, not too long before the election campaign, he proposed a resolution
                    which would have pinpointed India as a country to help. Why? Well, he might have
                    liked India but we were concerned about Communist China, and we didn't want
                    China to be seen as the model for third-world uplift. We wanted to have a
                    democratic model. So again it was China, and it was still the Cold War context.
                    And why did he accede instantly to Nehru's request for help in 1962? Remember it
                    was China - a communist country. So he wasn't out of accord with the American
                    procedure. I would jump ahead a little bit. Jimmy Carter also liked India.
                    Remember Ms. Lillian, who had been in the Peace Corps in Gujarat, north of
                    Bombay. In fact he sent her as his representative to the funeral of the
                    President of India. So he was favorable to India. Still when the Soviets went
                    into Afghanistan in 1979, he immediately made some efforts to reconcile with
                    Pakistan. Relations with Pakistan had gone to their nadir. They had never been
                    so low as they were just before then. But he wanted to open up the relationship,
                    because the Soviets had gone into Afghanistan. So there he wanted to do well by
                    Pakistan, because it was in our interest, because it was again in the context of
                    the Cold War. Thus I'm not sure that it's correct to say that there is something
                    inevitable or inherent in the democratic or republican makeup which makes one
                    favor Pakistan or India.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anymore on Bombay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: No.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it did help solidify your interest in the area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: Yes. We loved our stay in Bombay. We'd like to go back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you came back to Washington. What were you doing from
                        1964-66?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: 1963-64, I was assigned to the Army War College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania.
                    It was pleasant and useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the military understood the complexities of
                        issues as the State Department viewed them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>SOBER: No, I didn't find that. That's not to say that some of the military would
                    have had difficulty in understanding the byways of diplomacy in world affairs.
                    On the contrary, I must say that my relationships with the military were
                    excellent and I found by and large they were appreciative of a particular
                    viewpoint which our experience brought to the region. So in every way it was a
                    positive experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were then assigned to NEA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: Yes, the Bureau of Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs. My first job was
                    one which no longer exists - officer in charge of economic affairs in South
                    Asia. I stayed in that job for a couple of years. Then I was transferred within
                    the same bureau to be the deputy director, and then director, for regional
                    affairs, covering the entire bureau, which as you know includes the Middle
                    East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Other than reporting on economic matters, did we have
                        economic interest in the area.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: As for South Asia, no, not really. There is virtually no product of South
                    Asia that is necessary to the United States. Certainly nothing like oil which is
                    essential. We have business interests there. We have AID interests. It was a
                    period when Kennedy had already gone, but there was a considerable interest
                    under LBJ in economic development in the area and particularly in India. It was
                    a carryover from the idea I spoke of before, that India, as the second largest
                    country in the world, might be seen to be an example of successful economic
                    development along generally democratic lines. As a counterpart to China with its
                    backyard furnaces and such. So there was a good deal of interest.</p>
                <p>I think the economic element of our interest in South Asia at the time, which is
                    most strongly remembered in the region to this date, revolves around one of
                    those failures of the monsoon in the subcontinent. India had a failure of the
                    monsoon as I recall in 1965-66, and there was a threat of famine as they had
                    ever so often. Recall the enormous famine of Bengal in 1943-44. They appealed to
                    the United States for substantial help. I might say that the euphoria of Indo-US
                    relations that began and followed for sometime after the Sino-Indo War had
                    pretty well washed off by this time.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>The United States under LBJ was quite willing to help except that he had some
                    other concerns. The Indians were not being at all helpful on Vietnam issues
                    which more and more were preoccupying LBJ's attention. He also felt that the
                    Indians were not doing enough in their own agricultural system to help
                    themselves. It was a period when self-help was a very big thing to us. So LBJ
                    engineered this policy. We would help India but we would do what we could to
                    make sure they helped themselves. We had what we called the short tether policy.
                    Which meant that LBJ, and the White House, would reserve unto itself, the
                    authority to release segments of PL 480 assistance in accordance with
                    perceptions of how much India was doing to help itself.</p>
                <p>Now it was a very important program. Some 10 million tons of grain were shipped
                    to India by the United States in one year, 1966-67. An unprecedented amount of
                    grain. It used to be said that there was an almost unbroken line of ships from
                    the American gulf ports to India.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, we did press the Indians to do more than they'd been doing, in
                    the way of self-help. In the way of rodent control, pesticide control, better
                    storage/silage, better transport facilities, easing up on credit facilities to
                    encourage farm production. A wide variety of things. Despite the fact that in
                    many ways the aid program was successful, and widespread famine itself was
                    averted, what tends to be remembered in India, I have found, is not how much we
                    did for them, but what we did to them, as to “political” strings, aid strings,
                    where we were mean and hard. Well, some people might say that that was for their
                    good but it one of those things that didn't leave too good a taste.</p>
                <p>I was in the Bureau dealing with these issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were watching the Indian economy very, very closely
                        then. What you were reporting on had a direct impact.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: I was in Washington, of course, and we got our reports from our people in
                    India. The Agriculture Department here was quite active, Orville Freeman was
                    LBJ's Secretary of Agriculture. He was designated as the key point man here, and
                    we had meetings with the Indian agriculture minister here, Mr. Subramaniam. We
                    sent people over there. We watched pretty carefully what was going on. As we
                    watched we did send very substantial amounts of grain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you moved to NEA. During this five-year time you had
                        Philip Talbot as assistant secretary, then Raymond Hare, Luke Battle and
                        then Parker Hart. Did you feel a lack of continuity, so many in such a short
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>SOBER: No, it didn't disturb me. They were all competent and professional. I had
                    personally very good relationships with each one of them and still consider
                    myself a friend with each of them. A good competent man at the top is smart
                    enough to rely on staff. That's the continuity that's necessary. If they didn't
                    know they sought advice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were professionals.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: Talbot was the only one who was not foreign service. But he had been
                    associated particularly with South Asia during and since World War II. So there
                    was not a problem in his not knowing the region. As they came in, there were no
                    substantial changes in the deputies, and so you had a strong continuity
                    element.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what position did you assume.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: I transferred from being the officer in charge of economic affairs for
                    South Asia to being Deputy Director of Regional Affairs for the whole Bureau.
                    And in a fairly short time, I became the Director. I was the Director of
                    Regional Affairs from October 1966 for three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is Regional Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: Regional Affairs is an umbrella. It covers and has functions relating to
                    bureau-wide activities that don't properly fit into the purview of any of the
                    specific country areas, the country directors. So, for example, you talk about
                    military matters across the whole vast area, you talk about congressional
                    relations, about relationships with AID - those which don't deal with a single
                    country that would be more properly dealt with by a country director. A variety
                    of things.</p>
                <p>Basically, in addition to the things I've said, it's what the assistant secretary
                    wants to use it for.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the latter half of the Johnson
                        administration. Dealing with India and Pakistan, you coming in from that
                        angle, to a bureau known for its battles over middle east policy, especially
                        with regard to Israel, how did you view this. You hadn't been really
                        involved in this before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: I had a little bit of experience, really on the periphery, having been
                    three years in Turkey. But not directly with Arab-Israeli affairs, one of the
                    things I was thrown into quickly at the time of the June 1967 War.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>I worked with Luke Battle, who was the assistant secretary, on military questions
                    and military supply by the United States. Frankly I never perceived in the NEA
                    Bureau the type of battle that you refer to. Of course it existed outside. I
                    think there are misperceptions about how the State Department looks upon this
                    particular region. Questions about the so-called Arabists, who are widely
                    perceived to be pro-Arab and anti-Israel. Well, frankly, with perhaps some
                    exceptions, I would say that this is a misperception. My own feeling regarding
                    the people who had worked in the area, lived in the area for years, was that,
                    yes, their views on different questions had been colored by their experiences,
                    but I always felt that they deserved the credit for doing what they believed was
                    right, not because they had a bias which predetermined which way they were going
                    to think. I certainly did not see at the leadership of NEA, certainly not in Ray
                    Hare or Luke Battle, any predisposition to take one position over another on the
                    Arab-Israeli question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Pete Hart stronger?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: Ray Hare you might say was an Arabist but he had such a long and broad
                    experience. Pete Hart was an Arabist but I had less to do with him because he
                    didn't stay very long. He was only in as Assistant Secretary for three months or
                    so, as you may recall, until just about the time we were leaving to go to
                    Pakistan. Again, with Pete, although his experience had been Arabic rather than
                    Israeli, I felt that he, just like the others, to positions he considered to be
                    right for the United States, as an American, not because he had a predetermined
                    position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a problem with the military? There's nothing
                        they hate more than someone raiding their larder.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: You remember the Six Day War. It was so short. It wasn't a question of
                    resupply. The war ended before you could have had any.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the '73 war that caused all the heartburn in the
                        military.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>SOBER: In the '73 War, we were in Pakistan, and so I know about that from having
                    toured the Middle East, studied it, lectured on it. I believe I have some
                    understanding about that. But to go back to the period we were talking about.
                    One of the myths that hasn't been knocked down is that the enormous victory by
                    the Israelis in the Six-Day War was only possible because they had all this
                    American equipment. As a matter of fact, during that war there was not a single
                    combat aircraft of American origin in the Israeli Air Force. Not a single one.
                    Those air attacks were basically with French-made planes. We had agreed to sell
                    the Israelis some combat planes but nothing had arrived as yet. And in fact, we
                    had been following a policy of great caution with regard to military supply, let
                    alone resupply, to Israel. Certainly during the Eisenhower-Dulles years and even
                    later on. It would soften up a little bit, but by '67 they didn't have a single
                    US-made combat aircraft. Now after that it changed. There was a great positive
                    reaction in the United States to what they had been able to do.</p>
                <p>LBJ, as president, decided to go along with what had been begun, but not really
                    come into force, by the time of the '67 War. For example, he did agree, the US
                    did agree, to supply the Israelis with the F-4 which was a first line aircraft,
                    which we had not been willing to supply previously. One of the things I was
                    involved in as Director of Regional Affairs was to work out, with our military,
                    the first ferry supply of F-4's to Israel. It was at a time when the very clear
                    public and outright military arrangements with Israel had not yet come into
                    effect, so that we had a lot of cautions about what sort of reactions we were
                    going to have in the area. We wished not to endanger unnecessarily our relations
                    with Arab states. So we talked about painting out any country insignia on the
                    aircraft and sending them by a route, (it turned out, as I recall, through
                    Crete), that would not cause too much disturbance, not too much public notice.
                    It was still, in those days, a far cry from the supply relationship as it became
                    in later years.</p>
                <p>No, I do not recall that there was ever a serious problem with the military. Yes,
                    some reluctance then and at a later time about denuding American military
                    stocks. As I recall, that became a question in '73 when Nixon ordered the
                    resupply to Israel during that war. But I'm very glad to say, as I'm sure we all
                    are, that the military do take orders from the civilian leadership. So there may
                    have been a little bit of hesitation or reluctance, but never to my knowledge,
                    was there any simple refusal to do it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SOBER: Particularly involved may be overstated but we talked about the colonels
                    in Greece. I was in the job of Regional Affairs at the time of the colonels'
                    revolt. Greece was then part of GTI (Greece, Turkey and Iran), a part of Bureau
                    of Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs. Greece, Turkey and Cyprus were removed
                    to the European Bureau in the spring of 1974. But in '67 they still were in NEA.
                    So we dealt with that particular problem.</p>

                        your concerns, did it give us a surprise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: Came as a surprise to me. I really can't talk about others, or whether, as
                    some people have suggested, we were involved, or had some foreknowledge if not
                    some participation. I simply do not know. I knew that there was a widespread
                    perception that the United States welcomed this, a widespread perception among
                    opposition elements in Greece. To what degree we were involved, if at all, I
                    simply do not know. I am not aware but I'm not prepared to say we were not
                    involved. Because at certain levels you simply accept not knowing about these
                    things.</p>
                <p>Our major concern, I suppose, was to make sure that Greece's connection to the
                    United States and with the free world, the NATO alliance, remained intact. There
                    were concerns about domestic political trends in Greece before that. Concerns
                    about this fellow and that fellow. Certainly as I recall it the advent of the
                    colonels seemed to cement the western alignment. To that extent I suppose it was
                    welcome. But I don't want to suggest that people liked the idea of the military
                    throwing out a civilian system in order to take over - that they liked that as
                    such.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SOBER: The overriding concern, aside from the domestic and political implications
                    of a military overthrow of an elected system, was Greece's connection with NATO.
                    I surely don't remember any debate suggesting that we try to force the colonels
                    out, if in fact we could have been able to do it. I just don't know enough.</p>

                        that impact in any way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: I mentioned LBJ and his preoccupation. This had a certain impact in the
                    subcontinent. I don't recall that it had very much to the west of the
                    subcontinent. It was too far away. But I think that was one of the reasons LBJ
                    was impatient with India.</p>
                <p>For example he called off an official visit by the man who was at that time the
                    Prime Minister of India, Lal Bahadur Shastri, which was to take place in '66, as
                    I recall it. (I may be a year off). Also there was a delay in the AID consortium
                    meeting on Pakistan, which annoyed the president of Pakistan, President Ayub
                    Khan, at that particular time. I think that LBJ's preoccupation and worries with
                    Vietnam were factors there. Not necessarily that he took these actions in
                    retaliation to what he perceived to be an inadequate support of our position on
                    Vietnam. But it affected his state of mind in dealing with various other
                    problems. He was perhaps not giving as much attention as he would have in
                    different circumstances.</p>

                <p>Rawalpindi and Islamabad are a dozen miles apart. Rawalpindi was used first as

                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>SOBER: You'd have to think hard to identify actual changes of policy and action.
                    It was generally known that Nixon was favorable to Pakistan. He had been
                    vice-president when our strong connection with Pakistan had been built up,
                    during the Eisenhower years. When he was out of office he had visited there and
                    kept up his contacts. Again there is this syndrome that a republican
                    administration is going to be good to Pakistan. As a matter of fact things began
                    to happen that were not known to the general public. Nixon did stop in Pakistan
                    in spring of 1969, just a few months after he had taken office. He had a meeting
                    with the man who replaced Ayub just briefly before, President General Yahya Khan
                    raised the question as to whether Pakistan might be willing to be helpful, as
                    conditions permitted, in establishing some sort of link between the United
                    States and China. That was very secret.</p>
                <p>When we arrived in Pakistan in late '69, we still had certain problems. In 1965
                    there was a September war between India and Pakistan. I alluded to this before.
                    Much to Pakistan's annoyance, although CENTO was still going, SEATO was still
                    going, we still had a military defense assistance program that had started in
                    1954, and we had this 1959 bilateral agreement which I mentioned before, not
                    only did we not come to Pakistan's help in this war in 1965, but we said, in
                    effect, a plague on both your houses. We suspended military supplies to both
                    India and Pakistan. Now that sounds quite even-handed but, in effect, it hurt
                    Pakistan and didn't bother India at all, because India had not had anything
                    substantial in the way of US military aid, but Pakistan had become quite heavily
                    dependent. Not only for equipment, but for things like parts and ammunition. So
                    Pakistan felt betrayed by the United States. And the embargo on military
                    shipments was still largely in effect when Nixon came in. We had lifted it
                    slightly by saying that we'd sell spare parts. We said we'd supply non-lethal
                    weapons - some things that don't go bang, like radio or transport equipment. But
                    it was a pretty low-key level of military supply. So Pakistan was looking
                    elsewhere and China was the obvious place that they were looking to, mainly.
                    Thus that although Pakistanis perceived a benefit to them in Nixon's coming in,
                    the immediate effects were not much evident when we arrived in 1969.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your ambassador was Joseph Farland.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>SOBER: Joseph Farland had been a political ambassador before and had served in
                    the Dominican Republic and Panama, under Republican administrations. He'd been
                    an FBI agent during World War II and he was married to a lady whose father had
                    been a coal operator in West Virginia. There was a lot of money there, and I
                    guess where most of the money for political contributions came from. But
                    obviously Farland, when he was named to his third ambassadorial post after a
                    certain number of years, had some background. He knew something about the
                    system. He went out with obvious feeling that it was his job to improve the
                    relationship between the United States and Pakistan. And he set about to do
                    that. He liked to travel and liked to be seen. He was quite good at that. As for
                    running the embassy, my relationship with him was excellent. Without sounding
                    self-serving, let me say that I think in retrospect, he was wise in letting
                    experienced career people look after the operation of the mission. Which he
                    pretty much did. He saw himself as chairman of the board and myself as chief
                    executive officer.</p>

                <p>SOBER: We stayed a little more than four years. We came in October of 1969 and we
                    left in November of 1973.</p>

                        were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: President Yahya had come in in the spring of '69, having replaced Ayub,
                    another general whose time had run out after ten years. Ayub was forced out.
                    Yahya had a martial law system, and the military really ran the show at the top.
                    It was referred to sometimes as the Junta. But Yahya, to his great credit,
                    really wanted to move back toward a more normal political system. He instituted,
                    not too many months after he took over, a number of reforms, under what he
                    called a legal framework order and some other steps, which moved forward toward
                    the restoration of political party rights and eventually towards a national
                    political election which took place toward the end of 1970. What is what
                    noteworthy about this, is that not only did the election take place—a national
                    popular election for the National Assembly—but it was the first-ever democratic
                    national popular election in Pakistan's history, since the country was formed in
                    1947. There had been so much political maneuvering and shenanigans that they had
                    never been able to come to a really free and honest election. Now that took
                    place and I think it was very much to Yahya's credit. He was very much maligned
                    later on. Some of the complaints were justified but many were not. He isn't
                    given credit enough for what he did. He had the elections on the basis of one
                    man, one vote, which sounds normal and easy but was a very controversial issue
                    in Pakistan, as it now may be in South Africa. Because in Pakistan, one man, one
                    vote, meant that the majority of the electorate was located in East Pakistan, a
                    thousand miles away from, if you will, the core of the central government.</p>

                <p>SOBER: Now known as Bangladesh. It had been part of Indian, Bengal - which was
                    partitioned in 1947 and the Eastern portion became East Pakistan. Since there
                    were and still are more people in that area than in what was West Pakistan and
                    is now just Pakistan, it meant that they would have, and were scheduled to have,
                    more parliamentarians in the National Assembly than West Pakistan. A result of
                    that election was the almost unanimous victory for one party in East Pakistan,
                    which led, after several months, to the civil war which occupied almost all of
                    1971.</p>

                        which reflect the situation there. We've had interviews that have not been
                        completely checked over with Archer Blood and with, at somewhat a different
                        time, with Dick Post. Still there was this consulate genera-embassy tension.

                    from Dacca was always direct with a copy to the embassy. We never exercised a
                    privilege that we might have had to say no, we will clear and forward only what

                </p>
                <p>SOBER: Well, it was an honest election. It was remarkable in that it was the
                    first time such an election had been held since 1947. Mujib won 167 out of 169
                    contested seats in East Pakistan, which was to give him an absolute majority in
                    the National Assembly. That was December of 1970. Then the question was when
                    would the National Assembly be convened by Yahya. And what's going to happen.
                    Well, what would have happened, what everybody saw was inevitable, was that with
                    an absolute majority of parliament, Mujib, the leader of the Awami League, would
                    become the Prime Minister. Now that caused a great deal of concern among a
                    variety of people in West Pakistan, because Mujib had been campaigning on what
                    you might say was really a nationalist platform of so-called Six Points, which
                    would have given a very high degree of autonomy or self-rule, short of actual
                    independence, to East Pakistan. There were some people in East Pakistan who were
                    calling for UDI, Unilateral Declaration for Independence. There was a long
                    history, which we won't go into, of troubles between East and West Pakistan
                    because they are of quite different ethnic, cultural and linguistic backgrounds,
                    although the mass on both sides are Moslems—which is the reason why the one
                    state of Pakistan had been created. But there was a feeling, pretty wide-spread
                    in East Pakistan, that they hadn't been dealt a fair deal. That they had been
                    exploited by the more powerful political, military, commercial, financial
                    elements of West Pakistan; and they wanted a better deal.</p>
                <p>The prospect of being ruled by East Pakistanis was, quite frankly, not one that
                    many West Pakistanis could take easily to. Then there was, beyond that, a
                    concern, and this was surely a concern of the top military, whether these Six
                    Points would lead to the inevitable break-up of Pakistan. As a first step on the
                    way to a break-up. Six Points would have allowed foreign affairs and defense to
                    the central government, but very little else. There was a concern that Mujib and
                    his followers would then take the next, what appeared to some to be the next
                    logical, step towards breaking with Pakistan.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of dispute as to whether East Pakistan was a politico-economic
                    plus for Pakistan as a whole or not. But East Pakistanis felt, to a large
                    extent, that they had been milked and they would be a lot better off as
                    independent. To be free.</p>
                <p>Among the military, I'm sure, there was a deep concern. I think they thought that
                    if push came to shove, their major responsibility to the nation as patriots, as
                    servants of the state, was to maintain the integrity of Pakistan. Integrity is a
                    word we use all the time. We favor the integrity of Lebanon, whatever that is.
                    We favor the integrity of this country and that country. So saying that they
                    wanted to preserve the integrity of Pakistan is something one could understand.
                    But in a very troubled history, where east and west had not gotten along so
                    well...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much of an East Pakistani element in the
                        army?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>SOBER: Virtually none. This goes back to the British days under the Raj. Certain
                    ethnic groups had been identified as what they called, martial races. That did
                    not include the Bengalis. They were seen as poets and dreamers. The bulk of the
                    Pakistani army, as is true now, was made up of Punjabis and Pashtuns. There was
                    a very small percentage of East Pakistanis. So that was a serious problem.</p>
                <p>Another problem related to the civilian political element in West Pakistan, and
                    how it would react to a circumstance where not only would it have a Bengali,
                    East Pakistani, Prime Minister, but a man who really was in charge. Now there
                    had been, in previous years in Pakistan, Bengali, East Pakistani, Prime
                    Ministers. There were three. They were always brought in by, and in fact were
                    under the thumb of, West Pakistani Presidents, Generals or Governors General. So
                    Mujib would not have been the first East Pakistani Prime Minister, but he would
                    have been in an assembly which really had the power, to which he was
                    responsible. Not responsible to a President or a Governor General. Much has been
                    made of this, going over the history. The question is how the man who was the
                    most popular political elected leader in West Pakistan, the winner of the
                    December '70 elections there, one Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, would deal with being
                    number two. Well, he would be the deputy Prime Minister. He had won an absolute
                    majority of the assembly seats in the December '70 elections in West Pakistan.
                    So he was clearly the number two man, but he didn't begin to have the number of
                    backers that Mujib would have in the Assembly. A lot has been made as to whether
                    Bhutto, presumably not willing to be number two, not willing to be anything but
                    number one, didn't have a hand in making sure that the Assembly didn't get
                    convened. There was a lot of politicking involving visits by Yahya as well as
                    Bhutto to Dacca to meet with Mujib. They were not able to come to an
                    agreement.</p>
                <p>And ultimately on March 25, 1971, three months after the election, the Pakistani
                    military which had been ferried over by air, over Sri Lanka (that's another
                    story, why not over India) from West Pakistan had been reinforced in East
                    Pakistan in anticipation of a possible crunch. And in fact on March 25, they
                    were let loose. I would call it a military riot. We use the term police riot.
                    That was the beginning of the civil war, with some very gross abuses of force by
                    the Pakistan military. It was the beginning of a war that only came to an end in
                    December when the Indians mopped up the Pakistani forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was rapport between the embassy and the consulate
                        general in Dacca. I can't recall the Archer Blood interview but there was
                        some indication that the consulate general saw things a certain way in Dacca
                        than the embassy saw in Islamabad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: There was a certain division. People in Dacca were horrified by the gross
                    abuse of force by the Pakistani military. No question that there was a gross
                    abuse of force. Their reaction was unanimously in favor of the Bengalis, the
                    East Pakistanis, and against whatever action the central government was
                    taking.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>In the embassy in Islamabad, no one that I know of was pleased with what was
                    happening in East Pakistan. We were aware that there was a gross abuse of force.
                    On the other hand, unlike Dacca, we were looking upon the situation in terms of
                    a national viewpoint of Pakistan and in terms of a US/Pakistan relationship.
                    When I say looking at it from a national Pakistani viewpoint, I come back to
                    what I said before. My feeling was that the Pakistani military, rightly or
                    wrongly, were informed by one imperative, which was to preserve the integrity of
                    Pakistan. Whether it was a mistake to have an East Pakistan to begin with is,
                    going back to 1947, another question. Historically it was not destined always to
                    be a part of Pakistan. It was always destined, maybe, to be a separate state.
                    Nevertheless, it was part of Pakistan and these military thought it was their
                    duty to their country, to keep the country together.</p>
                <p>We had our Civil War. I don't say that I want to compare our Civil War and
                    Lincoln's effort to maintain the union as similar to the Pakistan situation. But
                    at the edges you can see similarities.</p>
                <p>In addition to that we had the view of whether the United States should be seen
                    as taking a position to favor the break-up of any country. There had been the
                    Biafra problem before that. There is no modern counterpart in any other part of
                    the world that I can think of to what happened to Pakistan - the break-up of a
                    country, because of its own action. No other revolution has been as successful
                    in breaking up a country. So this is a highly unusual thing.</p>
                <p>The question I think we need to deal with in Pakistan is, whatever you thought
                    about the wisdom of what they were doing, was it absolutely wrong for Pakistan
                    to take the view that if they did not do this, the country would be broken up.
                    The wisdom of how they were doing it is another thing.</p>
                <p>There was on this issue a very sharp division of view with Dacca. To say it
                    again, we never in any way had any censorship about what they were reporting. We
                    were very much aware of their position. I remember as DCM, I went over to Dacca
                    in the spring of 1971 while Arch was still there - it was before he left in
                    June. I didn't have oranges thrown at me but I would say that there were people
                    who were very unfriendly towards me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean in the consulate general.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: Yes. We were not, in the embassy, about to take a position to break
                    relations with Pakistan, or make a statement to that end. At that time, Bengali
                    leaders, wherever they were, had already issued a unilateral declaration of
                    independence after the break-out of the Pakistani military. We were not about to
                    say yes, let's recognize the new regime. People had fled to Calcutta. We were
                    not about to do that. So that was the basic difference.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>There was another issue that didn't come to public view until after this. Arch
                    left in June of '71. And that was three or four months after the trouble began
                    in earnest with the fighting. I'm going to talk about one other thing that was
                    unhelpful in a general way. Not as a value judgment as to the idea's being
                    unhelpful, but the way it was done was unhelpful. There was a virtual unanimity
                    in our Dacca consulate staff that we should denounce the West Pakistani effort
                    in East Pakistani in every way we could. I was somewhat sympathetic with the
                    thought that we hadn't done enough to distance ourselves, and as I recall, I
                    think it was time when I happened to be in charge, we did send a telegram in
                    which I recommended that we take certain steps, in addition to those we had
                    taken to distance ourselves politically from the methods that the Pakistanis
                    were using in East Pakistan. We had come out publicly in saying we didn't
                    condone, we didn't endorse what they're doing. But we didn't say, gee we think
                    it's awful the way they're handling this. I recommended that we do something
                    more to distance ourselves.</p>
                <p>Never got a response.</p>
                <p>The consulate in Dacca sent a dissent message to Washington about the American
                    position, arguing that we should disassociate from what the Pakistanis were
                    doing. In oversimplification, that was what it was. And that was certainly their
                    right to do. It was an expression of what they felt, and so I had no question or
                    problem with their doing that. Again that message went directly. I think it was
                    unfortunate, in retrospect, that they sent it as an unclassified message with a
                    copy to New Delhi and maybe some other places. Now such a message was destined
                    to become public, which it did immediately. And of course that was very much in
                    line with the Indian government's view which was very much against anything
                    Pakistan would do, and so much against this particular effort in East and West
                    Pakistan.</p>
                <p>I think that was a mistake. That it had become a public disclosure of a dissent
                    message enraged Washington, enraged Richard Nixon. As I recall (perhaps
                    incorrectly) the immediate result of that was that he said that he wanted those
                    people fired. Well that didn't happen but it enraged some people.</p>
                <p>I think that this method was probably an overreaction. You do have certain
                    constraints, as government people. You may feel very strongly. If you are
                    serving you have ways to voice your protest. It's not supposed to be a public
                    protest. So that was a mistake.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>Well, Arch left in June. Let me say that Arch and I came into the Foreign Service
                    together. I had known him all those years. He had been in Dacca during part of
                    the time my wife and I were serving in Bombay. We knew he had been there. I
                    guess I was personally responsible for Arch's being brought as consul general to
                    Dacca, because Ambassador Farland had wanted to have a very strong officer. We
                    recognized the importance of getting good reporting and strong control through
                    the actions of the consul general in Dacca. It was my recommendation to Farland
                    which Arch accepted. He had been political counselor in Athens, and he was
                    detached in mid-tour and brought to Dacca. When we had these events in the
                    spring of 1971, Farland felt, and I agreed with him, given the way events had
                    progressed, that when Arch was ready for home leave in June of 1971, it was
                    probably better for him not to return.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there also a question of evacuation of the families
                        because of the attitude of the Pakistani troops, feeling as if they felt we
                        thought they couldn't defend them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: There was some soreness with regard to the evacuation. We did decide, when
                    the fighting was growing, to evacuate our people. They went to Tehran, most of
                    them, to begin with. We did have a little trouble at first getting an agreement
                    from the Pakistani military about bringing in a plane. They were dragging their
                    feet. People in Dacca were justifiably outraged at that.</p>
                <p>I remember myself getting on the phone, again when I was in charge, because
                    Farland was doing a lot traveling outside. I had a telephone conversation with
                    the Foreign Secretary of Pakistan, Mr. Sultan Khan, and I said that I thought
                    the delaying actions of the Pakistan authorities in East Pakistan over the
                    preparations for the evacuation were “intolerable.” That was the word I used.
                    When the ambassador returned a couple days later, he was called in by the
                    Foreign Secretary who protested that I had used that word “intolerable.” As I
                    remember, Farland did not discipline me. On the contrary he reported on it
                    positively by telegram. The word I got back was (and it made me feel good,
                    because there was a lot of hard feeling) that when the consulate general in
                    Dacca saw a copy of the message, they cheered because I had said that. But there
                    were hard feelings. There is no question about that.</p>
                <p>Then another little incident occurred. These are footnotes. No great consequence.
                    I flew down from Karachi where the Pan American plane had stopped with the load
                    of evacuees from Dacca on the way to Tehran. I guess I did say something to this
                    effect: Remember, we still have people in Dacca; and this is a very touchy
                    situation there, and so I hope we'll all be somewhat careful about remarks to
                    the public about what's happening. We knew about our people's feelings. They
                    were outraged, thoroughly outraged. I had no problem with that. But we were in a
                    somewhat sensitive position. After all, we were dealing with the Pakistani
                    government. My remarks were taken rather offensively by some of our people—as if
                    they were meant as a gag.</p>

                    that. It was a highly emotional situation. I say there was gross abuse of force
                    by the Pakistan military. You can read whatever you want into that. I think the
                    outrage was justified, but after all we were diplomats representing our
                    government and the situation was fairly complex.</p>

                <p>SOBER: What I said before was that there was some other element at the time this

                    1971. In June Arch left. As you may remember July 1971 was the time of the
                    rather momentous, historic visit by Henry Kissinger to Beijing. It was the
                    culmination of what I referred to briefly before. The first approach about China
                    was made by Nixon to Yahya in the spring of '69. In a later trip, by Yahya to
                    the United States, in '70, he was asked if Pakistan would in fact serve as a
                    channel of communication. Not as an intermediary but as a channel. And in fact
                    Pakistan did and it did it very successfully, very ably and secretly. Those
                    messages between the United States and China, via Pakistan, culminated in the
                    secret flight of Henry Kissinger from Rawalpindi to Beijing about the 5th or 6th
                    of July 1971. What was not known at the time, except to one or perhaps two
                    people in our Embassy, not including me, was that these negotiations had been
                    going on. In retrospect it is very clear that Washington, with its knowledge of
                    these things, was not about to endanger the successful culmination of our talks,
                    via Pakistan, by unduly and seriously endangering our relations with Pakistan.
                    So with that retrospect, one can see why we perhaps did not take as forthright
                    an action as we might have in expressing our opposition about the way the
                    Pakistanis were going about trying to keep the country together.</p>

                </p>
                <p>SOBER: The Indians, as I mentioned before, had taken a very open and forthright
                    position, denouncing the government of Pakistan, and established a relationship
                    with the leaders of the Bengalis of East Pakistan who had got through the net
                    and had fled to Calcutta.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was Mujib?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: He had been picked up on the night of March 25 by the Pakistan military,
                    and brought to Pakistan, where he spent the rest of that year in jail. India was
                    just 100% in favor of East Pakistan's independence. They cited the fact that a
                    huge mass (they used the figure ten million) of refugees had come over. And a
                    large number had come over. But clearly it appeared to me then and it appears to
                    me now that India had another iron in the fire and that was something against
                    Pakistan in general. I remember we sent a telegram, in the early summer, when
                    Indian participation was already evident. They were providing safe refuge for
                    the rebels, called the Mukti Bahini, who had crossed the border and they were
                    safe. The Pakistani military were not about to cross the Indian border in hot
                    pursuit. And the Indians were providing arms and some training, and some
                    military leadership. Things began to come out. I remember we sent a telegram
                    fairly early in the summer from Islamabad saying, in our opinion, that India was
                    heading toward an irresistible temptation to cut Pakistan down to size. This in
                    effect is what happened. I think that the Indians saw a ready-made opportunity.
                    Not that they devised it, but which they would exploit it.</p>
                <p>I remember that the United States tried to prevent the war. I was in charge and I
                    had a telegram, go to see Yahya. The same telegram went to Ambassador Keating in
                    New Delhi, go to see Indira Gandhi. Make a strong play that they should agree to
                    have military forces withdraw a certain distance, about ten miles, from the
                    border in East Pakistan, and let UN people come in and separate them to try and
                    avert a war. I went to see Yahya who happened to be in Karachi and he said,
                    sure. It was in Pakistan's interest to agree to anything like that because
                    everybody knew that if it came to a war with India, Pakistan couldn't possibly
                    succeed in East Pakistan. Ambassador Keating saw the Foreign Minister, because
                    Indira was away, and couldn't get anywhere with him. India was already
                    committed.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>A little later, Indira visited Washington, in November of '71 and Nixon tried to
                    talk her out of any engagement with Pakistan. Didn't succeed. He's written about
                    this in his memoirs.</p>
                <p>In early December, the war started. The way wars go in the subcontinent, they
                    take two to three weeks. That's the standard period for war. And that's what
                    happened. At the end of it Pakistani forces in East Pakistan were mopped up.
                    There was some fighting on the western front but it was inconclusive. Some
                    90-odd thousand Pakistanis were captured and that was the end of Pakistan as it
                    was. There was no more East Pakistan. And that was the birth of Bangladesh.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Pakistanis regard America during this time?
                        Were they pleading for help?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: No. Fairly early after the March 25 beginning of fighting, we suspended
                    any new shipments of military equipment. Now that wasn't very important because
                    the embargo that we put on in the '65 war had never really been lifted to any
                    substantial degree. So there wasn't much coming. But there were a few things in
                    the pipeline. In fact we had a glitch. The Foreign Minister of India, Swaran
                    Singh, had visited Washington in the summer. He was told no, everything was
                    stopped. It turned out that there was a shipment of about five million dollars
                    of stuff in the pipeline, which went through. The Indians cried foul, we've been
                    misled. Well even then, five million dollars didn't make for much, and the type
                    of things we were sending to Pakistan had no important—if any—military impact in
                    East Pakistan. It's not a place where tanks could be used, where combat aircraft
                    were used. It's very watery. But the Indians took it as another sign of American
                    hostility.</p>
                <p>Pakistanis were not unfriendly to us, although we did not help them. We stopped
                    all military shipments. All economic aid was also put on hold because you
                    couldn't operate in East Pakistan. Everything was in suspension. We didn't
                    really help them but on the other hand, we certainly didn't abuse them
                    publicly.</p>
                <p>In Islamabad, we maintained a friendly and open discussion under Yahya with
                    Pakistan. We went to see him. We appealed to him on several occasions. I think
                    we can take some credit in that he decided to not have Mujib executed, which
                    some people in West Pakistan were demanding. We made appeals to him, some of
                    which were accepted, to ease up in East Pakistan. Replace the military governor
                    with a civilian governor, who happened to be of Bengali origin; offer amnesty.
                    Some things were done to soften things, but the total effect was not very much.
                    The die had been cast and the fighting had already gone too far. It could not be
                    stopped or pulled back.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>And we kept saying, as we had been saying in the Sinai Desert one or two years
                    before, stop shooting and start talking. We weren't ever able to get to that
                    point. Fighting had gone too far. Nor were we able to avert a war in December of
                    1971. But during that period, I would say we maintained a good, decent
                    relationship with the government of Pakistan. Not to say we liked what they were
                    doing but in terms of a dialogue with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel at all threatened during the war between
                        India and Pakistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: I happened to be returning from home leave when the war broke out. My wife
                    and I had just arrived in Tokyo on the way back. I got a call from the desk
                    officer, Peter Constable, about two in the morning at the hotel, and he said the
                    war had started. I was on a plane the next morning at eight o'clock out of Tokyo
                    Airport. We couldn't fly over India because the air space was closed. I finally
                    got a plane to Tehran and flew from Tehran to Kabul and drove from Kabul back to
                    Islamabad. I got back to Pakistan about two days after the war began.</p>
                <p>There was one minor air raid. One airplane came over and shot up the terminal in
                    Rawalpindi. No bombs. The Indians clearly were superior overall, although the
                    Pak air force was giving quite a good account of itself. No, I don't remember
                    that we were worried.</p>
                <p>We did evacuate people, dependents and non-essentials—people from various posts
                    in Pakistan, especially from Lahore and Islamabad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the rest of the time you were there, how did things
                        play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: My wife and I stayed on almost two more years. Ambassador Farland went on
                    home leave in January and while he was home on leave, he was designated to be
                    Ambassador to Tehran. That was an important job. I think his work was
                    appreciated, particularly the Pakistan link with the opening of China. He came
                    back for a week to say goodbye. But basically throughout all of 1972 and until
                    we left in early November of '73, I was in charge of the mission.</p>
                <p>It was a very interesting time. Pakistan had suffered a very serious defeat -
                    90,000-plus people had been captured. They had lost half their country, more
                    than half their country in terms of population. It was a tremendous humiliation.
                    And the question was, what's going to happen. Yahya gave up immediately with the
                    surrender of the West Pakistani forces. He turned power over to Bhutto who had
                    been the big winner in the elections of West Pakistan the year before and was
                    the obvious civilian to take over, which he did. He became President, and was in
                    charge of the country until he was ousted by Zia in 1977.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>It was an interesting period, while Pakistan tried to set itself right, and in
                    retrospect, they did a remarkable job. The United States was reasonably
                    sympathetic. We provided a great deal of economic aid. Bhutto had a past in
                    which he had at times criticized the United States. He had been very critical of
                    our failure to help in the '65 war, for example. He had been the architect, to a
                    large extent, of the close relationship between China and Pakistan, at a time
                    before we opened up with China. That had caused some troubles between the United
                    States and Pakistan. But I would say that certainly for the two years I was
                    there, and I know for some years thereafter, the United States and Pakistan
                    under Bhutto maintained a very good dialogue and relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your personal impression in your dealings with
                        Bhutto?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: My dealings with him were always very friendly. I had reopened an embassy
                    relationship with Bhutto in 1970 during the first year I was there, with
                    Farland's approval. That relationship had been closed down by the previous
                    ambassador who had been turned off by Bhutto because of some of these
                    anti-American things he said. But I didn't think that was the way to operate
                    because he clearly was a man with a future. My relations with him were always
                    very, very good. It wasn't a deeply social relationship but it had some social
                    overtones. And a very open political relationship. My impression of him at the
                    time was, here is a man with great ability. He was a standout. I saw him operate
                    with a crowd of more than 110,000 people in Lahore Stadium, where he was
                    speaking in Urdu, which was not a great language of his. He had people eating
                    out of the palm of his hand. On the other hand I saw him dealing on
                    sophisticated global issues, on a one-to-one level with a man like Henry
                    Kissinger. He had that vast reach to deal with the populace. He was a populist
                    leader. But with a very sophisticated and sound view of world events.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think he understood the United States? What made it
                        tick. I always had the impression that the Indians tended to respect but
                        really look down upon the United States, being a lot older
                        civilization.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: I think that's true of Nehru. I think Nehru tended to look upon the United
                    States as rather an upstart and with not too deep culture. This is perhaps what
                    Nehru imbibed while he was at Cambridge.</p>
                <p>Bhutto was different. After all he had gone to the University of California at
                    Berkeley. I wouldn't say which one of us does fully understand the United
                    States. But I think that his understanding was more than adequate. He did
                    understand pretty well. Whether he looked down upon us I can't really say. My
                    own relationship was very open and on a very level basis. During the period I
                    was there, I must say, we had no disputes of any important nature. On the
                    contrary, it was very close and very good.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else to cover during that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: There were no major disputes or events. We were sympathetic in helping
                    Pakistan get back on its feet. We did have a series of very important economic
                    aid agreements. Military aid was not opened. It was not an issue. I think he
                    wanted very much to have good relationships with the United States. With Iran
                    also, which was a factor in this. He stayed in CENTO. You might have thought
                    from his statements in earlier years that he would have wanted to get out of
                    CENTO. He did get out of SEATO but that was understandable because East Pakistan
                    was the link towards the east and towards southeast Asia. With East Pakistan
                    gone, Pakistan had no basis in SEATO and he did get out of it.</p>
                <p>I think the reason he stayed in CENTO, was not only that he wanted to maintain a
                    close relationship with the Shah of Iran but also because of the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>We discussed questions of all types. There were no major regional issues that
                    needed to be dealt with in that particular time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you come back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: We came back at the end of 1973. I started, at the very beginning of 1974,
                    in the job of Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of Near Eastern and South
                    Asian Affairs.</p>
                <p>I had been asked by Joe Sisco, who at the time, in the summer of 1972, was the
                    Assistant Secretary for Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, to come back and
                    be his Deputy on South Asia. I wasn't too anxious but I said okay. I didn't get
                    back for fifteen or sixteen months, during which time I was Charg�. By the time
                    I got back Joe, after a slight glitch in which he was supposed to leave the
                    Department, had been asked by Henry Kissinger to become Under Secretary for
                    Political Affairs. He stayed on but he left NEA before I started there. Roy
                    Atherton was Assistant Secretary and then Roy asked me fairly soon, after a
                    couple of months in which I was dealing with South Asia for him, to be his
                    senior deputy for the whole bureau. This was the job I had then from about April
                    of '74 until I left the Department at the end of April 1978.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were the years of Henry Kissinger. From your vantage
                        point, how did you see him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: I have a mixed view of Henry Kissinger. In terms of ability, as a genius
                    or near genius, in terms of capability. As an individual, toward the other
                    extreme.</p>

                    <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about his method of operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: I was watching him on the Middle East. On the many long trips which he had
                    to the Middle East, he was always accompanied by Roy Atherton who was my
                    immediate boss, leaving me for long periods of time as Acting Assistant
                    Secretary for the whole bureau. I was receiving the reports of what they were
                    doing, having to back them up in a variety of things. And I say in terms of
                    professional ability, I thought Kissinger was brilliant, a genius or near
                    genius, with the ability to express, to put into words, spoken or written, at
                    very high level. I have a great admiration for his ability as a
                    professional.</p>
                <p>His method of operation was a different thing. He was, as you may know, an
                    egomaniac. He had an enormous obsession with secrecy. He was afraid that if too
                    many people knew what was going on, he would lose control. He always used to
                    say, he wanted control, he wanted control. He didn't want anything to go on
                    without his having a finger in it and pressing the button. He was not very
                    anxious for people to show any particular initiative. You could understand this
                    regarding things he was immediately concerned with, like peacemaking. Even on
                    other things, he had this obsession that people shouldn't do anything without
                    his knowing about it beforehand. I can say from my own personal experience that
                    his personnel management would be open to very sharp criticism by professionals
                    in that field.For example I remember being excoriated by him in a way that was
                    rather humiliating, at an early morning staff meeting of the assistant
                    secretaries. I was acting assistant secretary. I was criticized by him for
                    something I had done not quite to his perfect liking. Before the whole group.
                    Now this was really not very good. It was humiliating. And I'm not sure it was
                    very good in the impression it left on others. Surely on me. So my relationship
                    with him was not good personally. But that in no way diminishes my very deep
                    respect for his professional ability.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back, did you find any times when his close
                        attention to matters, not letting others have any initiative hurt American
                        relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: I'd have to think long and hard about that. I don't think of anything
                    important that comes to my mind. I give him credit for that.</p>
                <p>Whether things would have been better if he had relied more on initiative by
                    others is another question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Cyprus question. That's one that came up in
                        July of 1974, when a pro-Greek coup on Cyprus put in the Greek Samson who
                        was absolutely unacceptable to use the term to the Turks.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>SOBER: It didn't happen on our watch. Cyprus erupted shortly after a
                    reorganization in the spring of '74 under Kissinger, under which Greece, Turkey
                    and Cyprus were separated from the NEA bureau. The North African states were
                    brought in from the African bureau. And so when the crisis blew, it was the
                    European bureau which had the responsibility for the Cyprus crisis.</p>
                <p>We were aware of the problems. Tom Boyatt knows a good deal more than I do. There
                    was a difference of view and I don't feel close enough or well informed enough
                    to say much. Except that Kissinger's obsession with being numero uno caused a
                    problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any thing that particularly sticks out during this
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: Many things did happen. The Middle East was the main thing. Kissinger had
                    that in his pocket. Roy Atherton was his man, and I was playing only a
                    supporting role in a quite minor way. In general Kissinger's actions on peace
                    making were brilliant and great. There were things that I question in
                    retrospect. For example we agreed, in retrospect I think this was wrong, not to
                    have any substantive dealings with the PLO. That was part of the deal in the
                    Sinai II agreement. He agreed on that and I think that was a mistake. In
                    international diplomacy, you don't agree not to have discussions with anybody
                    except at the mercy of a third party. I think that was wrong.</p>
                <p>But by and large the diplomacy of peacemaking, given the possibilities of the
                    time and what we had a reasonable right to expect, was carried out
                    brilliantly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've been here for three hours. What gave you the
                        greatest satisfaction, if anything.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: This is bound to be a self-serving opportunity, isn't it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, absolutely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>SOBER: The thing that gave us the most pleasure, and that's different than
                    satisfaction, was our duty in Bombay. For my wife and myself that was the time
                    when we enjoyed ourselves thoroughly. Even when the Indians didn't like us. More
                    so when they did like us. There was enough of the good.</p>
                <p>As for a single moment of satisfaction—I guess your question comes down to
                    something that probably was related to something that was important in which we
                    had some role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It doesn't have to be. It could be with relationships, or
                        how one viewed one's career.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>SOBER: Okay, this is a little self-serving but you asked for it. It was at the
                    time when I was Charg� d'affaires in Pakistan.</p>
                <p>Bhutto wanted to have a constitution, a good constitution. It was hammered out
                    over a period of months. It's the 1973 Constitution which is still in force
                    although it has been diluted, amended, transgressed upon in fact, by Zia, the
                    last previous boss. And that's a problem in current Pakistani politics. But it
                    was a good Constitution, which was adopted unanimously by the Parliament—quite
                    an event, because you had some very stalwart opposition leaders of different
                    stripes. But every single one of them stood up to vote “yes” in the Parliament.
                    I was with other heads of mission in the Parliament gallery, watching. It was a
                    good Constitution, recognized at such, with a recognition of provincial rights,
                    and reasonable protections for democratic processes. Why I had the most
                    satisfaction was that I was there as the acting American head of mission, and as
                    always we were a rather prominent mission. It is certainly true today and it was
                    true then. I had fairly wide contacts, including not only with Bhutto but also
                    with senior opposition people. I remember I had discussions, just one-on-one, at
                    the house with two of the major opposition leaders, one from Baluchistan and one
                    from the Frontier, in which I encouraged them to take an open attitude toward
                    the effort to come up with a good constitution, one that was good for Pakistan;
                    give the country for the first time in its history, a really good constitution
                    that the people would like. The satisfaction I had was reflected from the day
                    that the constitution was adopted. There was a reception in Rawalpindi, by the
                    government, for the members of Parliament, to which diplomats were invited. I
                    remember (my wife remembers this more accurately) that numbers of the political
                    leaders, including the opposition, came up to thank me for my role.What was more
                    interesting to me was that I had a call about that time, from Mr. Bhutto, just
                    after the reception. He'd gone to spend the evening in Murree, which is a hill
                    station some thirty miles north of Islamabad. He asked me to come see him, which
                    I did. Drove up. And what he wanted to see me about was to express his thanks to
                    me for helping get the constitution through. Now that's an unusual thing, but
                    not such a wonderful position for any diplomat to be in. I took it in all good
                    grace. I didn't think that I was interfering. But, in retrospect, since that
                    constitution is still looked upon as what Pakistan should go back to, by the
                    present government led by the daughter of the man who asked me to come up and
                    see him at that time, it gives me some satisfaction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is what diplomacy is all about. We are called upon
                        from time to time, not only because we are a powerful country, but we have
                        had a constitution that has gone through all sorts of strains, but it still
                        has held up. Naturally, if you are talking about a written constitution, an
                        American is not a bad person to ask about it.</hi>
