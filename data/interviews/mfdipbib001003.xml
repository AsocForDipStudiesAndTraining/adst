                <p>CHARLES E. RUSHING</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Thomas Dunnigan</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: July 2, 1996</p>
                <p>Copyright 2000 ADST</p>
                <p>Q: I am interviewing Charles E. Rushing, who had a lengthy career in the Foreign
                    Service, including service in a number of what we would call “hot spots” around
                    the world. The date is July 2, 1996, and I am Thomas Dunnigan. To begin with,
                    Charlie, tell me something about your background and how you became interested
                    in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>RUSHING: I went to college at a small Lutheran-affiliated liberal arts school
                    called Augustana in Rock Island, Illinois. I graduated in '51, went on to law
                    school at Duke and graduated in 1954. After passing the Bar exam in the District
                    of Columbia, I was drafted into the Army.</p>
                <p>I became interested in the Foreign Service when I was in college, but, at that
                    time, one had to pass the foreign language exam at the same time that you passed
                    the rest. I knew that I couldn't pass the language exam.</p>
                <p>When I was in law school, the regulations were changed. If one passed all parts
                    of the exam except the language, one could join the Service and stay without
                    promotion until you passed the language part within a limited time. In 1952, I
                    passed all of the exam except the language part. At that time—that was the
                    McCarthy era—practically no one was brought into the Foreign Service from '52 to
                    '54. Had that not occurred, I would not have finished law school. I would have
                    gone from the first year of law school into the Foreign Service. But, since
                    practically no one was appointed, I was able to finish law school.</p>
                <p>Q: When you came into the Service, which was, I gather, in 1954, were you given a
                    session at the Foreign Service training school at the time?</p>
                <p>RUSHING: No. I was drafted in 1954. I finally came into thForeign Service in
                    March of 1956.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After your military service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came into the Foreign Service, did you receive
                        antraining?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes, like everyone, I went through the A-100 course, which was the basic
                    entry-level course at FSI [Foreign Service Institute]. FSI at that time was in a
                    brick building at C and 21st Street, next to what had been the War Department
                    and would become “New State.” Our particular class, for some reason, was split.
                    Those of us who stayed in the Department for our first assignment took half of
                    the A-100 course when we first came in and then, before going abroad, took the
                    other half. I was one of those who stayed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a particular reason for requesting a
                        departmentaassignment for your first one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Oh, I didn't want it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, you did not want it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: I did not want it. In those days, everyone wanted to ginto the Foreign
                    Service to serve abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And where were you assigned on that first tour?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: I was assigned to the Public Correspondence Branch, which had just been
                    Wristonized. Curiously, it appeared that the Department didn't know how to best
                    utilize someone with my background. The Army had had the same problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would be in the Bureau of Public Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: The Bureau of Public Affairs. I worked in the PubliCorrespondence Branch
                    for my first two years in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Drafting letters of response to inquiring citizens?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Exactly.</p>
                <p>Q: Were there any issues or problems that were major that you could recall from
                    those days that excited the public or were there a variety of issues?</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>RUSHING: There was a lot of expression of anti-Communism. Many wrote that the
                    Department was penetrated by Communist agents. There was a lot of mail in
                    opposition to foreign aid. Those were the two things that, offhand, I can
                    remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there many Foreign Service officers in the Bureau of
                        PubliAffairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: No. I can only remember, say, six in the entire Bureau whwere either new
                    slots or replacements to civil servants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mostly, there were civil servants. Presumably, your
                        superior waa civil servant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any work with USIA [United States
                        InformatioAgency]? They weren't independent at that time already.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: No, I didn't. I had a couple of stints as staff aide to State's
                    Assistant Secretary for Public Affairs. One thing I remember is that on a
                    week-end I couldn't get his safe open. I had the combinations, but no one had
                    ever told me how to manipulate the lock. You know, you have to skip a number,
                    and then go back and skip a number, etc. So, on a Sunday afternoon, alone in the
                    office, I was not getting anywhere</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An exercise in frustration. Did you do any speeches or do
                        anpublic appearances of your own?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Not that I remember, but I did so later, particularly long recruiting
                    trip I made in the '60s in the South and Southwest.</p>
                <p>Q: After two years in the Department, in 1958 you were transferred overseas to
                    your first post, to Naples. Did you get Italian language training before you
                    went?</p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were two years in Naples. What did you do there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>RUSHING: I first started out as the officer who put together the extensive
                    documentation required for immigrant visas. The consulate general was large in
                    terms of numbers, at that time. There must have been 18 Foreign Service
                    officers. Then, I was made the chief of the Protection and Welfare and Shipping
                    and Seamen Section. One even more junior officer than I was in the office. I
                    think we also had four nationals.</p>
                <p>Q: That would have been a busy office, I assume, with all the American interests
                    in Southern Italy. Did you get an opportunity to do any substantive reporting
                    work while you were in Naples?</p>
                <p>RUSHING: If I did, I don't remember. The job itself demanded a loof after-hours
                    work and was perhaps the busiest in the consulate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Communists strong in that district?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: No. Southern Italy was relatively conservative. But throughout Italy
                    there was a large Communist presence. It was the second largest party in Italy.
                    But the Christian Democrats were the ones who counted the most.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the ambassador from Rome visit the consulate or did
                        you hava chance to get up to see the embassy in action?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: I went to Rome quite frequently. I had both friends and business there.
                    But I don't remember that the ambassador ever came to Naples during my time
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there for what was a rather crucial election in
                        195or...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: It was in 1948, wasn't it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there was another one in '58 where the Christian
                        Democratincreased their majority.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: I don't remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much anti-American sentiment in the district
                        that yocame across?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>RUSHING: No, on the contrary. I think there was a general pro-American attitude.
                    Americans were liked. There was a relatively large group of Italo-Americans,
                    that is, people who had gone to the States, made a bit of money, and then they
                    went back to Italy. As you know, by far the largest element in emigration from
                    Italy to the United States was from Southern Italy and Sicily. People in the
                    North were better-off and, as was almost always the case, those who are
                    better-off don't leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about neo-fascism? Was that evident at all? It was
                        only teor twelve years after the destruction of fascism.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes, it was. The neo-fascist party, the MSI [Movimento Socialista
                    Italiana], was quite strong, particularly in the South. I'm trying to think of
                    who ran the municipal government in Naples at that time. I can't remember. I
                    think it was the Christian Democrats. But, as in the case of politics in Italy,
                    almost all governments, including local governments, were coalition governments.
                    So, there might well have been MSI people on the city council.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else stand out in your mind from that tour in
                        Naples?It must have increased your competence in Italian.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes, it did. One of the things that I concerned myself with a good deal
                    of the time was visiting American seamen who were in jail for one reason or
                    another.Also at the time, an American woman, a longtime resident of Capri, died
                    there. Her daughter in the U.S. did not want to have anything to do with
                    executing her estate, administrating her estate, or anything. I went through her
                    effects, taking inventory and eventually arranging for shipment of her effects
                    to her daughter in the States, who never came to Italy. We had a great deal of
                    correspondence including designing a headstone and her burial in Italy. That
                    went on intermittently, month after month, and involved several trips to Capri
                    and stays there.</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, well, it's presumably better that you had to go to Capri for it than the
                    Siberia. In 1960, after two years in Naples, you were transferred to East
                    Africa, to Asmara. Why did this happen? Had you asked for a transfer? Was your
                    time up?</p>
                <p>RUSHING: My time was up. Naples was a two-year tour. I thoughthat Africa was
                    interesting and perhaps would enhance promotion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1960 it looked that way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: I was first assigned to Benghazi, I think. Did we have consulate in
                    Benghazi?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had an embassy in Tripoli and, for a while, we had a
                        consulaoffice in Benghazi.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: I think I was assigned to Benghazi first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, either one of these assignments, with your
                        Italian,would have made sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes. But Benghazi washed out for some reason that I don'remember. Then,
                    I was reassigned to Asmara.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did we have a post in Asmara?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: For a couple of reasons. Asmara was the capital of Eritrea, which was at
                    that time, ruled by Ethiopia. The Italians bought Eritrea from the Ethiopians at
                    the end of the last century. Then, Mussolini used Eritrea as a jumping-off place
                    in his invasion of Ethiopia in 1935. It was also one of the first pieces of Axis
                    territory to be liberated. The Brits entered Asmara from Sudan in '41 or '42.
                    Then, it was under UN trusteeship. Eventually, the Ethiopians, through the
                    United Nations, assumed sovereignty and it was treated as a province. The U.S.
                    military had a large communications base there called Kagnew Station. One
                    interesting thing was that practically all of the message traffic during the
                    Korean War, went from Washington to Asmara and then from Asmara to Korea.
                    Eritrea was a very good place to have for this purpose. The installation and the
                    city were high, at 8,000 feet, and not too far from the equator, where
                    propagation was particularly favorable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me a little bit about Asmara as a city. Had it
                        beedestroyed or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: No. A beautiful city. It looked like something out of the movies. It had
                    sidewalk cafes and a beautiful cathedral, excellent restaurants, there was a
                    golf course, there were outdoor swimming pools. But it got so cold at night that
                    the pool at the consulate would only get up to about 65 during the day and that
                    was cold.</p>
                <p>The consulate itself was in a compound. The office building, the principal
                    officer's house, my house as the deputy principal officer, and the consular
                    officer's house were all together. The compound included stables, swimming pool,
                    and a tennis court. I'vundoubtedly romanticized this, forgetting the high
                    altitude fatigue (8,000 feet), the relative isolation, difficulty of having
                    meaningful exchanges with local officials, etc.</p>

                <p>RUSHING: I was the deputy principal officer, although I'm not sure that that
                    description existed in those days. I was number two, and there was also a
                    consular/administrative officer, a CIA [Central Intelligence Agency] guy and his
                    secretary, a USIA, and an AID [Agency for International Development] officer.
                    There was also a State secretary.</p>

                <p>RUSHING: My activities and reporting that I did tended to be oeconomic and
                    commercial matters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then the principal officer did most of the

                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your relationship with the embassy in Addis
                        Ababa? Dithey supervise you or did you report directly to Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: As I recall, we reported directly to Washington with info to Addis.
                    Because of the sensitivities of our position, we had to deal with Kagnew and the
                    Ethiopians on a daily basis. At the time, Ed Streator was sort of my counterpart
                    in Addis. I happened to be there when he got news of his next assignment. The
                    communicator came in and said, “Mr. Streator, your next assignment is Rome!” Ed
                    replied, “Gee, that's interesting. I had asked for another African assignment.”
                    The communicator said, “Well, it's a garble. They spelled it L-O-M-E.” Of
                    course, Ed was being assigned to Lome!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this period, there was an uprising against the

                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: I'm not sure. I think, in the time I was there (only from January
                    through September of 1960), there were two attempted coups. One of them held up
                    my/our departure from Frankfurt via Ethiopian Airlines to Asmara. I remember a
                    second one, but I don't remember whether that occurred after I had left, or
                    while I was there.</p>
                <p>Q: After these months in Asmara, you were suddenly transferred to Salisbury,
                    Southern Rhodesia. Tell me about that. How did that come about?</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>RUSHING: I met and married an Italian young woman who had been born in Asmara, as
                    had her parents. Her grandparents were among those who came to Eritrea in the
                    early 1900s from Sicily and Puglia. She was working for Aden Airways, which
                    folded a long time ago. It was a part of the overseas operation of BOAC [British
                    Overseas Airways Corporation].</p>
                <p>She and I met at the airport when I was meeting the courier. I was duty officer
                    which meant I had to be available 24 hours a day each week-end, every third
                    week. One of the great things about Asmara was that you could hear the airplanes
                    coming in to land from anywhere in town and you could beat them to the airport.
                    So, it was never a question of having to call up and say, “Is it on time?” I was
                    playing tennis and I heard the airplane, so I got into the car in grimy, smelly
                    tennis clothes and drove out to the airport to meet the courier. Asmara was a
                    big courier station. From Asmara, couriers would go to Aden and Khartoum before
                    stopping at Addis and farther south and ending up in South Africa. Besides the
                    courier, there was this lovely woman there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who is now Mrs. Rushing and she is indeed lovely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: In those days, as you remember, if you married someone from the country
                    to which you were assigned, you were transferred almost immediately. Of course,
                    also in those days, you had to submit a request to marry a foreign national to
                    the Secretary of State together with your letter of resignation. One or the
                    other would be accepted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Happily, it all turned out well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes, it did. So, therefore, after marrying, we were transferred to
                    Southern Rhodesia, which was quite a change, although still Africa. Another
                    beautiful city. Five thousand feet high, jacaranda trees, sophisticated
                    infrastructure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul general there at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: John Emmerson. Delightful and effective. An FSO Japanese expert who was
                    one of the four “Johns” crucified during the McCarthy era. He had been our
                    consul general in Lagos before Salisbury. He was succeeded by a political
                    appointee named Goren, whose first name I've forgotten. He had been the
                    chancellor or vice chancellor of Baylor University and then deputy director of
                    the Peace Corps. After Salisbury, he was assigned to Libya, and I believe was
                    killed there in an automobile accident.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, Southern Rhodesia was still a colony, I
                        believe,but there was a thrust for independence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Southern Rhodesia at the time was a Crown Colony, and one of the three
                    elements of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland, the other two Northern
                    Rhodesia and Nyasaland. In the 1950s, the Federation had the highest growth rate
                    in the world for a few years. But the winds of change were blowing. Southern
                    Rhodesia held out longer than Nyasaland, which became Malawi, or Northern
                    Rhodesia. The Prime Minister of the Federation at the time was Roy Walensky. He
                    had been a railroad man. There was a story in connection with that. One of the
                    leading Southern Rhodesian nationalists, was driving from Salisbury to the
                    second largest city in Southern Rhodesia, Bulawayo, and lost in a race with a
                    train at a railroad crossing and was killed. The story that circulated among the
                    Africans was that the engine driver was Walensky.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That did little to help matters, I'm sure. Was there
                        segregatioat the time in Southern Rhodesia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes. The “best” hotel in Salisbury at the time did not admit black
                    Africans. But the consulate general used a hotel by the name of The Jamison,
                    which was also a first-class hotel, very nice, and it did admit blacks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, when black Americans came through, they could stay
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much violence at the time? Was the embassy at

                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: No, there really wasn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you and the other Americans there were not in
                        danger?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the links between the rights of Southern
                        Rhodesia anthose of South Africa? Were they strong?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes, They were relatively strong. Of course, the whites in South Africa
                    had been there since the 17th Century, when the original Dutch settlers came
                    there. The Southern Rhodesian whites liked to think of themselves as more
                    liberal and more open-minded, more accommodating to African aspirations, and I
                    think that was generally true.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. Was our consulate
                    general in Salisbury accredited to the Federation or to the Southern Rhodesian
                    government? How did that work?</p>
                <p>RUSHING: Accreditation came from the Queen as did my exequatur as consul. It was
                    a complicated constitutional arrangement. Southern Rhodesia was a Crown Colony
                    but also a component of the Federation which also included Northern Rhodesia and
                    Nyasaland which were British Protectorates, I think. The capital of the
                    Federation was Salisbury which also was the capital of the Crown Colony of
                    Southern Rhodesia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we see the Federation as a viable instrument or did we
                        thinit was just contrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: I think we were ambivalent about this. I remember when Governor [Soapy]
                    Williams, as State's Assistant Secretary for African Affairs, came through with
                    Sam Lewis, who was his aide. Governor Williams was something of a romantic. He
                    believed that the Africans, if given full power, would be able to achieve a
                    great deal by themselves. This did not prove the case in most instances. The
                    African regimes were often wrecked by tribalism and corruption. So, on the one
                    hand, I know the U.S. espoused freedom and self-government for the Africans, who
                    mostly opposed the Federation. On the other hand, I think there was also a
                    feeling that may not have been articulated, that there was hope for the
                    Federation and it made sense for the three territories to be together, and that
                    it would be stronger and perhaps would be ultimately of greater benefit to the
                    Africans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What destroyed the Federation? Was it the black-white
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: The black-white problem. The political and economic power was in the
                    hands of the whites who were unwilling to share enough of it, fast enough, with
                    the blacks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Southern Rhodesia being white and the other two had a
                        strongeblack influence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: But still in Southern Rhodesia, whites were maybe only a quarter of the
                    population or even less. Maybe there were 500,000 whites in Southern Rhodesia at
                    the time. I don't remember what the total population was, perhaps seven or eight
                    million. With the later advent of a black government, the white population
                    dropped to maybe 250,000.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they were the controlling level.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Oh, yes, indeed. The most insistent African nationalists were under
                    Banda in what became Malawi. They were pushing harder, I think, than anyone
                    else. It's curious that when Banda did come to power, he turned out to be the
                    most conservative of the three leaders. It was the only black country in Africa
                    that recognized the white government in South Africa and Malawi had an embassy
                    down there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned Governor Williams' visit. Did you get
                        manAmerican visitors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: A fair amount, yes. One year we hosted a visit by the National War
                    College. There were also various Congressmen and American businessmen, many of
                    whom were in the tobacco business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And were black organizations in the States concerned

                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: I'm sure they were, but I don't remember that. It was not manifested
                    much at the time. We, of course, in the consulate general, maintained close
                    contact with the African national leaders. I knew Robert Mugabe (the present
                    President) personally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wanted to ask, were the whites annoyed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: They undoubtedly were. There may have been some private expressions of
                    concern made directly to the consul general, but I was not aware of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the contending parties, that is, the Europeans and

                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes. They were. There were two mainly white parties, one led by Sir
                    Edgar Whitehead, who was then the Prime Minister of Southern Rhodesia, and the
                    other was led by Winston Field, who was a conservative farmer less willing to
                    accede to African aspirations. The critical elections were held in 1962, I
                    think. Yours truly, together with the press and most everyone predicted a
                    victory for Sir Edgar Whitehead, and we were wrong. The party led by Winston
                    Field came to power. It was called the Rhodesian Front.</p>

                <p>RUSHING: There was a small party that was mixed. (This is not to say that the two
                    mainly white parties did not include a few blacks.) Some blacks could vote and a
                    few served in parliament. At a distance of 35 years, there's a considerable
                    amount I don't remember well. When Field came to power, the chances of an
                    accommodation between the whites and the blacks, leading to some sort of
                    multiracial government and society with full African participation, went out the
                    window. A kind of civil war broke out with the blacks using Mozambique and
                    Zambia (Northern Rhodesia) as bases.</p>
                <p>Q: Until finally independence was obtained. Were you receiving clear instructions
                    from Washington? Those were very difficult times presumably.</p>
                <p>RUSHING: As I recall, we were told to go to Field and his people and say that we
                    wanted them to be understanding and advance some of the things that the Africans
                    wanted, leading eventually to full franchise. Instead, Field declared unilateral
                    independence from Britain in 1965. The Federation had dissolved in 1963 when
                    Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland became independent.</p>
                <p>Q: After those years in Salisbury, you were transferred again into Africa. You
                    went in 1963 to Brazzaville, the Congo, as economic officer this time, having
                    been political officer in Southern Rhodesia. Was this a move you had
                    requested?</p>
                <p>RUSHING: I had requested a French-speaking post in Africa. What I had in mind was
                    Algiers or Rabat or Tunis, not Brazzaville. But, in those days, you went where
                    you were told to go and that was it. There was never any thought of saying,
                    “Well, I want something else.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the chief of mission in Brazzaville?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Wendell Blancke.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wendell is an old friend from my Berlin days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes, he had been consul general in Frankfurt before cominto
                    Brazzaville.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was at his swearing in, in fact, in the Department when
                        he wagoing off to be ambassador in Brazzaville.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>RUSHING: He was succeeded by Barney Koren.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the principal problems you had to deal with
                        iBrazzaville?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: The complete answer to that would be too long to relate. The pro-French,
                    conservative president at the time of independence was overthrown almost
                    accidentally by a group headed mostly by a group of “intellectuals” who had been
                    resident and studied in France for a number of years. In the process, they had
                    become radical Marxists whose enemy number one was the U.S.</p>
                <p>After taking power, they imagined that the U.S. embassy was concocting schemes to
                    overturn the “revolution.” In that atmosphere, it was difficult for us at the
                    embassy to carry on with even routine business. The wife of the Foreign Minister
                    was an American black who nervously avoided any contact with us, even socially
                    at receptions and declined any invitations from the ambassador's wife.</p>
                <p>But, specifically, the principal problem was the successive visiting U.S.
                    officials who were jailed. They shared a cell with common criminals. The only
                    sanitary facility was a hole in the floor. In the two cases that occurred before
                    my successor's arrival, I think they were jailed for at least a couple of days
                    before we could get them out. Those two cases involved a USIS [United States
                    Information Service] technician and a USAID guy who were on TDY [temporary
                    duty].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On what charges were they jailed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: That they were spies.To give you an idea of what prevailed, the Chief
                    Justice of the Congolese Supreme Court was hacked in little pieces by youths who
                    had been armed. You'd see these little kids walking around town with submachine
                    guns. The remains of the Chief Justice were thrown into the Congo River. The
                    kids would stop cars and take the doors and everything off. They would strip the
                    car, looking for arms.</p>
                <p>When my successor arrived and, before we could meet him at the airport, he was
                    picked up by the police and taken away. We didn't know where he was. We later
                    discovered that he was under arrest in a hotel. All of us at the embassy tried
                    to make representations to our Congolese government contacts, but they wouldn't
                    see us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On what charge had they picked him up?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>RUSHING: The formal charge was that there was something wrong with his visa. It
                    either had expired or wasn't yet valid. In other words, he either came too early
                    or too late. Then, unknown to any of us, a day or two later, the Congolese
                    authorities took him back out to the airport and put him on a plane to
                    Paris.</p>
                <p>The episode of my successor caused Washington to decide that although we would
                    not break off diplomatic relations, we would close the embassy. We left U.S.
                    interests in the hands of the British. I think the Germans took it up from
                    there. The French were also helpful in briefing us on events there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were there when our mission actually was
                        closed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: No. We had actually left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were the economic officer there. Didn't we have an
                        AImission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: We had an AID mission when I arrived there, yes. I was the economic and
                    commercial officer. A junior officer, who was also the consular officer, worked
                    for me on the economic/commercial side as well. We had an AID office in
                    Brazzaville and a few technicians in the field, but the program shut down
                    sometime after my arrival and U.S. personnel were sent home. It was felt they
                    felt they couldn't operate anymore with safety. They were under considerable
                    scrutiny and pressure. I inherited what was left of AID operation, mostly
                    files.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any Peace Corps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: No, but we did have two USIS Americans.</p>
                <p>Q: Throughout your comments about Brazzaville, its become quite evident that this
                    was a very Left-leaning government you were dealing with. Who were their
                    friends, the Chinese, the Russians?</p>
                <p>RUSHING: The Chinese, the Russians, the Cubans, all of whom established
                    relatively large embassies there, and countries like Guinea, radical African
                    countries. The Cubans were training the Congolese military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have any investments in the country that could be
                        affecteby their behavior?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>RUSHING: They were insignificant at the time. Later on, I believe American oil
                    companies participated in the discovery and exploration of off-shore oil.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left then in 1964 and came back to the Department of
                        State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Actually, it must have been '65.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '65, that's right, you served in the Department in the
                        Bureau oAfrican Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes, I was the desk officer for Congo-Brazzaville, Rwanda,and
                    Burundi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And somebody else had Leopoldville?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: But you had three countries to yourself. How much did State have to say in
                    what went on in those countries, say, in contrast with AID and CIA? Was State
                    really the leading player? I guess that's my question.</p>
                <p>RUSHING: I think in Brazzaville, State was the leading player. AID had stopped,
                    and the CIA station chief was probably as interested in what was going on across
                    the river in Kinshasa, the relationship between the two countries. He was also
                    concerned about the Congo's increasing radicalization and anti-Americanism. But
                    major decisions and action were in State's hands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, well, they had overthrown two governments and
                        killings anso forth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: We had few economic interests in Rwanda and Burundi, nhistorical
                    association with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The killings were going on at that time, weren't
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Oh, yes, thousands of Hutus were massacred in the 1960s by the ruling
                    Tutsi minority. A couple of years ago, it was the other way around. The Tutsis
                    were on the receiving end, suffering perhaps hundreds of thousands killed by the
                    Hutus. The West/UN did little or nothing to stop it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Governor Williams now is dead. Did you get a chance to
                        visit out in that part of the world while you were desk officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Before going back to the States on transfer, I made a trip to Zaire,
                    Bukavu (Dick Matherson was the consul general there at the time.) and spent
                    several days in both Rwanda and Burundi.</p>
                <p>Q: That's good. So, you'd been on the spot. There was a scandal, I remember, in
                    Burundi when the President was assassinated. There was an accusation that a
                    local of the U.S. embassy had done this.</p>
                <p>RUSHING: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Must have caused you some sleepless hours.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes, it did. I don't remember very much about that though, for some
                    reason. We had a Chinese defector from the Chinese embassy in Burundi. The
                    defector came to our embassy and stayed there, lived there, for weeks, and
                    finally got out. The rumor was that he was put in a big box, a big packing
                    crate, and shipped off to Brussels or someplace like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did we keep our embassy in Brazzaville closed?
                        Did wopen it during your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Oh, no, it was closed for several years. I don't remembewhen it was
                    reopened. We closed it shortly after I left in 1965.</p>
                <p>Q: Also, in Burundi in that period, our ambassador, Don Dumont, was expelled from
                    the country. Could you tell us a little bit about that? And several others of
                    his staff were thrown out. The King was overthrown.</p>
                <p>RUSHING: I don't remember why he was expelled specifically, but it was probably a
                    manifestation of the overall pro-communist stance of the Burundi government. It
                    could have had something to do with the Chinese defector. Maybe it was also due
                    to the general paranoia on the part of Burundi. In retaliation, we expelled the
                    Burundi ambassador in Washington. I sat in when Secretary Rusk told him to go.
                    We gave him more time than the 24 or 48 hours given to Dumont.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, from what I've read, there was a heavy
                        ChinesCommunist influence.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes, there was.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Q: That all came off without any trouble, I guess. Did we leave our post in
                    Bujumbura with a charg� for some time after Dumont was expelled or did we close
                    it?</p>
                <p>RUSHING: We didn't close it. I think Mike Rives was charg� for aextended
                    period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any other comments about your service on the Desk? Did you
                        finit interesting, worthwhile?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes indeed. Dean Brown was the office director. He was joy to work for,
                    a very fast study.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After two years on the Desk, you were transferred in
                        thDepartment to Personnel. Was this something you'd asked for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes. Harry Symmes was the head of that office at the time.</p>
                <p>Q: That's right. They were dealing with mid-career officers. When I was doing the
                    junior officers' program, Harry had the mid-career, and I believe Bill Boswell
                    did senior officers.</p>
                <p>RUSHING: Could be. I spent most of my two years in Personnel as head of the
                    Office of Training. We would select officers for long-term training. That meant
                    e.g., university training in management, in economics or in
                    geographical/political science. We also assigned people to the War Colleges. We
                    also worked with FSI in developing what kinds of training courses should be
                    instituted.</p>
                <p>Q: I remember because we worked together in those days. That's how we got to know
                    each other. Did you find that Foreign Service officers willingly took
                    assignments in the Department, or was there still the old drive to get out to
                    the field?</p>
                <p>RUSHING: As you know, in today's world, it's sometimes difficult to get people to
                    go out to the field. One of the reasons is a working spouse. Another was the
                    perception that promotional chances were enhanced by service in the Department.
                    When did the working spouse idea really become an important factor?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The late '70s, I believe. It wasn't as strong in our time,

                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: I certainly wanted to get out again. I had joined thForeign Service, not
                    what the Wriston report led to.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Q: We had a major election in 1968, with the Republicans taking over the
                    Democrats. Did you notice any changes in personnel at that time because of the
                    elections? Any change in morale?</p>
                <p>RUSHING: No, not that I remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I had the same reaction. I didn't notice any major
                        changes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: About the A-100 course, Scott McLeod, who was a prot�g� of Senator
                    McCarthy's, was appointed as head of security in the Department. This was in
                    1956. The McCarthy Army hearings in 1954 pretty well sunk him as I remember. But
                    in '56 there was still a feeling that the Department still had its share of
                    commies and misfits.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right, Security and Consular Affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: McLeod came and addressed my junior officer course, the A-100 course.
                    Despite everything in his background, I thought he came across very well and I
                    liked him.</p>
                <p>Q: I had a similar experience when I was transferred from Manila to Hong Kong, a
                    direct transfer. They brought me back to Washington and I was interviewed by
                    McLeod. We got along fine. I didn't have any problems with him, but other people
                    did. Do you have any other comments about your time in the personnel
                    business?</p>
                <p>RUSHING: I think we tried unrealistically to plot out a person's career so that,
                    at a certain point, you have this and, at a certain point you have that. I found
                    that, if the person did all of the things that he was supposed to do, he would
                    have to have a career of more than 40 years. I think we were being unrealistic
                    in trying to plan so exactly.</p>
                <p>I was impressed by the quality of people in Personnel. I was also encouraged by
                    the fact that everything was pretty much straight. I was the Chairman of the
                    committee that chose the officers for the War Colleges, which were, of course,
                    very desirable assignments. I had to disqualify myself from being chosen. Then,
                    as the exercise was finishing up, my boss said, “Charlie, you've done a great
                    job with this. I know you've disqualified yourself from consideration, but think
                    about it very seriously. I think you should go and make the National War College
                    your assignment.” I said, “Thanks a lot. Let me think about it.” My wife and I
                    decided against it on relatively mundane considerations. We would have had to
                    buy a second car, which we couldn't afford, and I would be driving it all over
                    across town every day and back, going to the National War College. In addition,
                    we were not looking happily on another—the fifth—year in Washington.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Q: Instead of that, you went out again and you went far out, to Laos, Vientiane,
                    where Ambassador Godley was in charge. Had you known him when he was in
                    Kinshasa?</p>
                <p>RUSHING: I had met him, but I didn't know him very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this assignment come about? You were an
                        Africaspecialist by this time and now we find you in Southeast Asia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: I don't know. The head of Personnel came to me and said, “Charlie, the
                    job of political counselor in Vientiane is coming open. It's a big operation
                    [for the State Department]. We've got about four or five political officers. I
                    think you'll find it interesting.” It sounded good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it would be a chance to use your French again.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: A chance to use the French, and going to a part of thworld that I'd
                    never been to before and was interested in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How large was the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: I've lost track of the numbers. In the embassy itself, there may have
                    been five political officers. Of course, the Agency had a large contingent
                    there, some in the embassy and some elsewhere. It wasn't nearly the size of
                    operation going on in Saigon, but it was substantial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the military? Advisors, Attach�s, what did we
                        have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: We had Attach�s. We had an Air Attach� with an airplane. We had an Army
                    Attach� with an airplane. Both of their offices were in Vientiane with their
                    support staff. Agency personnel were numerous all over the parts of Laos not
                    under the control of the Pathet Lao and North Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Laos when you arrived,
                        politically angovernmentally?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: The Prime Minister was Souvanna Phouma, who was a so-called neutral. We
                    were on good terms with him. At first, he was suspected because he wasn't
                    perceived as an out and out anti-Communist. Then, the far Right guy was Prince
                    Boun Oum, whose territorial fiefdom was in southern Laos around Pak Se. Finally,
                    there was Souphanouvong, who was the head of the Pathet Lao - allies of the
                    North Vietnamese.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The latter two were half-brothers, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes. The King, with no real power, was in Luang Prabang.</p>
                <p>The Agency had a big hand in this. Its activities were supposedlclandestine but
                    were widely known and widely reported.</p>
                <p>Q: You were there from 1969 to 1971 when the Vietnam War was raging. So, it had a
                    great effect on you. What about the question of U.S. bombing in Laos?</p>
                <p>RUSHING: The bombing was basically ineffectual in terms of contributing to the
                    end of the fighting on terms favorable to us. Basically, what the bombing did
                    was produce Lao refugees from the areas of the bombing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the embassy report this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: We tried to, but it wasn't a very popular view. In fact, USIA took a
                    poll of the Lao refugees, asking, “Why did you come here” and they said they'd
                    come to get away from the bombing, not to flee from the Communists. That was
                    published and the USIA guy almost lost his job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We apparently dropped a lot of them along the trail
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes, and it had little effect on the guerrillas. This is not to say that
                    the Communist forces in both North and South Vietnam did not suffer stunning
                    casualties. They did but it didn't stop them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you describe your relations with Laotian
                        officials?Were you able to talk to them and would they talk to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: They were quite accessible. The members of the government understood
                    that, if it weren't for the American presence, probably their so-called neutral
                    government would topple and be taken over by the Pathet Lao. They were urbane.
                    All of them spoke French. Some of them spoke very good English.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>Here's an anecdote. Ho Chi Minh died when we were in Laos. We got a circular
                    cable from the Department saying, “Send back an immediate message giving the
                    official reaction of your host government to the death of Ho Chi Minh.” I tried
                    to call the Foreign Minister or some one in his office and got no answer. (You
                    never knew whether they didn't answer because they weren't there or they didn't
                    answer because the phones weren't working.) So, I went down there and I couldn't
                    find anyone. I went back to the embassy and sent a telegram, something to the
                    effect that the death of Ho Chi Minh was greeted with restraint by the host
                    government officials!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to travel around the country at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes. You couldn't go very far by road, only about 20 kilometers by road
                    safely, outside of Vientiane. I flew to Luang Prabang and other places quite a
                    few times, including Pakse in the south, which was Boun Oum's territory. I also
                    went to South Vietnam and Thailand a number of times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Mary with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: In Laos, yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dependents were allowed to come?</hi>
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I gather that we had to keep denying that we had any

                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes, but “combat forces” may be a little misleading. The CIA had
                    personnel who were training and supporting anti-communist elements such as the
                    Meo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What role did the Chinese Communists play at this time in

                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>RUSHING: Oh, yes. We saw them when we went to receptions and sforth, but had
                    little direct to do with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It would have been an interesting time because it was just
                        beforthe Nixon visit to China in 1972.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Preparations for the visit were extremely closely held. I left Laos in
                    1971, I doubt whether anyone in Laos knew anything about it in advance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the North Vietnamese? Were they represented at
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Oh, yes. They were very active. There was both a South Vietnam mission
                    and a North Vietnam mission. The latter was only a couple of blocks from our
                    house. We would see each other every day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rather crowded for a small town, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: It was like a Hollywood movie of intrigue: there were the two Vietnamese
                    embassies, the Russians, the Indians, the Poles and on and on. I can't remember
                    all the missions but the number of diplomatic personnel in Vientiane may have
                    exceeded the Lao themselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our relationship with these Meo tribesmen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: They were guerillas in the pay and under the tutelage of the CIA. They
                    were valiant. I understand that we took many to the States when we got out of
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any Congressional delegations during this

                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes, we had quite a few Congressional delegations. Ambassador Godley's
                    predecessor discouraged visitors based on the secret nature of what was going
                    on. Godley changed that. He welcomed visitors and got a lot, including high
                    ranking military. Among them was Governor Wallace, Bill Buckley, the journalist,
                    and Dick Moose, then working for Senator Fulbright.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, Moose had been out with Lowenstein.</hi>

                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>RUSHING: He'd been out with Lowenstein.</p>
                <p>Q: I remember that famous mission and the report they sent out on Southeast Asia.
                    They were very critical of what was going on. I think the word was that deeper
                    U.S. involvement in Laos was being admitted. There were speeches made.</p>
                <p>What was the effect in Laos of our sudden move in May of '70 intCambodia?</p>
                <p>RUSHING: They were distraught.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the embassy have any control at all over U.S. bombing
                        in Laoor was that all done out of Saigon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: We had to approve the targets in Laos. In fact, there was a young
                    officer who was called the bombing officer who advised the ambassador on what
                    was okay or not.</p>
                <p>Among the files was a famous telegram that Godley's predecessor, Bill Sullivan,
                    had sent. The Navy and Air Force were both bombing targets in Laos. Their
                    accuracy was somewhat questionable. In one case the Navy came in and leveled a
                    town that was off-limits. Deploring that incident, Sullivan sent back a cable
                    which ended, “Tecumseh weeps,” referring to the famous statue at the Naval
                    Academy in Annapolis.</p>
                <p>Q: You left Laos in 1971 and went back to Africa, this time to Monrovia, where
                    you were chief of the Economic/Commercial Section. Tell us how that assignment
                    came about.</p>
                <p>RUSHING: The chemistry between the ambassador and DCM and me wasn't good. I
                    wasn't able to get the ambassador to define what he wanted the Political Section
                    to do. I also wanted to go back to Africa. The U.S. had a large stake in
                    Liberia, by African standards, with significant U.S. investments. So the idea to
                    assume the head of the Economic/Commercial Section there was an appealing
                    one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when President Tubman died?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: We had arrived in Liberia only a short time before Tubman's death. We
                    were on leave in the Canaries when I got a call from the ambassador saying,
                    “Come back at once.” So, we went back, but it turned out that there was little
                    to do in relation to Tubman's funeral.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, this was the end of a whole era in
                        Liberia.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>RUSHING: The end of a whole era. When we left Laos on a direct transfer to
                    Liberia, Mary and the kids went to Italy to see her parents, and I went the
                    other way to Hong Kong to have morning clothes and tails made. Liberia was
                    famous for this kind of formality. Then, after Tubman died and was succeeded by
                    Tolbert, everything was more informal. I think I wore the striped pants once and
                    maybe the tails twice. Now, I don't know where they are or even if I still have
                    them. That represented a considerable investment that proved unnecessary,
                    although I think I wore the morning clothes once later in Dublin.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes, a large one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Presumably, you were in touch with them on many
                        occasions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the problems that you had to focus on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: One of the problems was that the considerable American aid was of
                    limited effectiveness. For example, we had paid the Taiwanese to send a team of
                    rice growers to teach the Liberians how to grow rice. That was kind of funny
                    because rice was the Liberians' staple diet, and they'd been growing rice for
                    years. But the yields did not provide enough for self-sufficiency. As long as
                    the Taiwanese were there, the project went along just fine. But when the
                    Taiwanese pulled out, the Liberians were back doing the “wrong” things again.
                    Another example: you'd see AID-financed schools in the countryside that had been
                    abandoned because there wasn't money in the education budget to maintain
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Certainly, this must have been known to the AID people,
                        too?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>RUSHING: The AID personnel there included some very talented people, but the
                    unspoken emphasis seemed to be on an _______________________ program. In
                    addition to the USAID people, there were representatives from the IBRD, IMF, the
                    UN aid organization. There were substantial numbers of U.S. businessmen and, of
                    course, Liberian businessmen and civil servants. There was a lot to do. I spent
                    a good deal of time with the Liberian Ministry of Finance and with the American
                    businesses that were there. There were a lot of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a Peace Corps presence there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes, a large Peace Corps presence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I gather there was a heavy American overhang in
                        Liberia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Very heavy. I think the Peace Corps probably did a pretty good job. But,
                    again, I don't know how much was transferable, or what was transferred. By the
                    way, a successful novel, The Zin Zin Road, was based on Peace Corps activities
                    in Liberia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a Commercial Attach� or did you do that
                        woryourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: The number two officer was the Commercial Attach� but botof us were
                    involved in commercial activities.</p>
                <p>Q: Talk a little bit about the transition period from Tubman to Tolbert, whether
                    it meant anything to the people, whether it was a revolutionary change, or
                    whether things just went on as they had.</p>
                <p>RUSHING: Tubman, of course, was a very popular, charismatic, almost mythical
                    figure and had been President practically since God created the Earth. Tolbert
                    did not have the charisma that Tubman had. But, he probably was more
                    substantively effective. Tubman had built this huge presidential palace for
                    himself, a $15 million palace on the water which Tolbert then occupied. The
                    Tubmans of this world and the Americo-Liberians, of whom Tolbert was one, pretty
                    much had things in their pocket. The Americo-Liberians, as opposed to the
                    tribals, profited from almost all economic-commercial activity in the country.
                    During my time there, there were signs of the beginnings of serious clashes
                    between the Americo-Liberians and tribal leaders.</p>

                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes. Tolbert was overthrown by an Army sergeant and the former's
                    coterie, government and private, were killed, as was [Sergeant] Doe some years
                    later and Liberia descended into anarchy and years of civil warfare.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think our embassy had contact with these emerging
                        tribaelements or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: We did with some of them. One was a professor of economics at the
                    University of Liberia whom I knew quite well. He was a “radical” and would wear
                    tribal dress, which was frowned on by the elite. But I would say that the
                    embassy's contacts were, by and large, limited to the Americo-Liberians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mrs. Nixon came out, I believe, for Tolbert's
                        inauguration. Cayou tell us a little bit about that? Did it go well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: It went well, yes. I was one of the people who took her around. She was
                    gracious and her visit went off without any problems. Tolbert was delighted that
                    she was able to come.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left Liberia, did you leave with a feeling that
                        the country was going to come into some of the terrible things that have
                        happened since or did you consider it to be on a fairly even keel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: I thought it would carry on much as before, with the caveat that
                    something had to be done to accommodate the tribes and reduce corruption. The
                    names of the tribes were generally not commonly referred to in Monrovia during
                    my time. Certainly, we didn't expect the viciousness and duration of what
                    happened.</p>
                <p>Q: I guess that was the point I was trying to make. You ended your tour in 1973
                    in Monrovia and were assigned to the NATO [North Atlantic Treaty Organization]
                    Defense College in Rome. That must have been an interesting year. Did you find
                    it of value?</p>
                <p>RUSHING: I was delighted and it came out of nowhere. Was it useful? It was useful
                    in this sense, that it taught me a lot about NATO that I didn't know. It put me
                    in contact with people in other NATO countries that I could pick up the phone
                    and talk to when I was in Denmark.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are the classes conducted in French, English or both?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>RUSHING: The common language was English. We were split up in working groups
                    which met every day; one was conducted in French. The rest were in English.
                    Italian was largely ignored.</p>
                <p>Q: Following your completion of the Defense College, you went to Copenhagen as
                    political counselor and worked for Ambassadors Crowe and Dean. You were four
                    years in Copenhagen, from '74 to '78. What were your principal concerns there as
                    political counselor?</p>
                <p>RUSHING: Two areas. One was the NATO connection, of course. I wendown to Brussels
                    frequently for meetings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The NATO connection, of which Denmark does not pull heavy
                        weight.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: It does not pull heavy weight and a proportion of the population there
                    was not too happy with the Danish membership in NATO. The other main area was
                    the EEC [European Economic Commission], the U.S. relationship with it. I did the
                    reporting and instructions. Had you gone when Denmark had the presidency?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I was there, and we had a meeting in December of '74
                        iCopenhagen. A big meeting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: That was something that was of interest. We did some local political
                    reporting, too. We were concerned about the steadfastness of Danish membership
                    in NATO. We were also concerned with the Left wing of the Social Democratic
                    Party.</p>
                <p>Q: There were several governments during that time, weren't there? There was Poul
                    Hartling and Anke Jorgensen. Say a few words about this rather odd character,
                    Morens Glistful, and his Anti-Tax Party.</p>
                <p>RUSHING: He was the “Le Pen” of Denmark, wanted Denmark out of the EC and NATO. I
                    remember one night at dinner at the ambassador's, he was one of the guests and
                    the wife of a fairly leftist member of the Social Democratic Party was there and
                    they got into a terrible verbal fight. It started out in English and then
                    quickly shifted to Danish. My Danish wasn't good enough to follow it. Talk about
                    an embarrassing moment.</p>
                <p>Q: It was during your time there that we were anxious to upgrade the Danish and
                    other NATO country air forces. We were trying to sell them our new F-16. Can you
                    say a little bit about that situation and how it worked out in Denmark?</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>RUSHING: We had a very wise DCM [deputy chief of mission] in Denmark at that time
                    who saw that the basic element that was going to swing the deal one way or the
                    other, at least in Denmark, was going to be a political question. So, he
                    designated the political counselor (me) to be the control officer for this
                    project. In the other countries in the European Consortium (Norway, Belgium and
                    the Netherlands) control responsibility in the U.S. embassy was in the hands of
                    either the MAAG [military assistance advisory group] or the Air Attach�.</p>
                <p>There was a two stage process. The first stage was an elimination contest among
                    two or three American airplanes that would be competing for the place of being
                    the official U.S. candidate. The American choice would then compete with
                    non-U.S. fighters such as the British Jaguar, the French Mirage, and the Swedish
                    Viggen. General Dynamics won the fly-off, so to speak, with the F-16.
                    Interestingly enough, at the time, the so-called fly-away cost was $9 million a
                    copy. The fly-away cost today is many times that amount.</p>
                <p>As you know, this was a major U.S. Government effort. I spent a good deal of time
                    going back and forth to Brussels, the center of the project, and lobbying
                    members of the Danish Parliament. It was the Parliament, in particular, the
                    Defense Committee of the Parliament, that would make the recommendation to the
                    Danish Government which plane the Consortium should buy. Fortunately, the
                    ranking member of the Defense Committee was a friend of mine. That helped.</p>
                <p>In the last days of the competition, the Swedes came in with a particularly
                    attractive offer. My Parliamentary friend said that had they made it a month
                    earlier, the Danes would have been forced to go with the Viggen. But it was just
                    too late in the process and support for the F-16 was solidifying in all of the
                    other countries.</p>
                <p>Q: So it all worked out well and we sold the F-16, which has proved to be an
                    excellent airplane. You had a labor officer there with you in Denmark as part of
                    the Political Section. Tell me something about his work and why we had one
                    there.</p>
                <p>RUSHING: Labor and the labor unions were politically extremely important. That
                    was true even under a right-wing government. Because of their proportional
                    electoral system, coalition governments were almost always the result. The
                    Social Democrats were usually the strongest political party. Denmark remains a
                    welfare state. The resulting system was very expensive. Many of the benefits
                    taken for granted in the 1970s may have been reduced.</p>
                <p>Q: It was important for us to keep in close touch with the movement in the Danish
                    Labor Confederation. Why was it so difficult to form governments in a country
                    like Denmark? It's a homogeneous country, basically, and yet it seems splintered
                    when it comes to politics.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>RUSHING: As mentioned earlier, Denmark has a proportional electoral system which
                    is common on the continent. This is unlike the system in the United States and
                    Great Britain where “the first past the pole” wins. One of the effects of the
                    proportional system, is that a single party rarely if ever emerges with 51% of
                    the vote. So, there's always a need to negotiate and to bring other parties in
                    to form a government. In Denmark, this problem was compounded because a
                    relatively low threshold was demanded for parliamentary representation. For
                    example, if a party receives only, say, five percent of the overall vote, it
                    would win at least one seat in Parliament. I think that during my time, there
                    were seven parties in the Parliament.</p>
                <p>Q: So, as a result, you have a number of small parties and they all have to be
                    taken into account when forming a government. Did you find the Leftist
                    influence, the Communist influence, very strong during this period in Denmark?
                    Anti-American feeling?</p>
                <p>RUSHING: There was a considerable amount of anti-American feeling from the Left
                    wing of the Social Democrats, intensifying with the Socialist People's Party and
                    the Communists. Much of it focused on our role in Vietnam. There were frequent
                    demonstrations in front of the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean in front of our embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go after Copenhagen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: When it was time (after four years) to look for another job, I noticed
                    that the DCM job in Dublin was opening. I bid for it as did approximately 75
                    others and ended up on the “short list.” This personnel process corresponded
                    with the Danish six-month term of the EC presidency. I served as the primary
                    interlocutor between Washington and the Community during that period. In that
                    capacity, I went to several of the EC capitals including Dublin. I met the
                    ambassador, we talked, and he chose me for the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very good. What was the ambassador like? Bill Shannon was
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes. Ambassador Shannon had been a journalist with the New York Times.
                    He and his lovely wife were very successful with the Irish. They had contacts
                    with all elements of Irish society. He had a phenomenal memory and was himself a
                    historian of Irish affairs, having written at least one book on the subject.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Q: How did the ambassador divide the work with you? Sometimes ambassadors want
                    the DCM to run the embassy, sometimes they want to do it themselves, sometimes
                    they want to only be involved in high-level representation.</p>
                <p>RUSHING: Basically, I ran the daily affairs of the embassy. That's the way the
                    ambassador wanted it. This is not to say that he was uninterested, particularly
                    in personnel matters. He, of course, was very apt socially and did reporting
                    himself on some occasions. However, most of the reporting came out of the
                    political and economic sections. Occasionally, I would turn something in, but
                    not normally. I think it generally went quite well. In fact, the embassy
                    received a sterling report from a team of Foreign Service Inspectors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the size of the embassy staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Very small. The American personnel, the ambassador, DCM, a political
                    officer, and economic/commercial officer, three consular officers, two in
                    administration, a USIS officer, a Defense Attach�, two communicators and three
                    secretaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the problems you found at the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Aside from relatively mundane ones, including internal administration
                    and visas, there were only one or two. One involved the ambassador's, in effect,
                    campaigning with the leader of the opposition in an election period. Another was
                    the ambassador's firing of the USIS officer because of his “Christmas letter”
                    which leaked to The Irish Times and which contained both unflattering and
                    flattering remarks about the Irish. The Times only published the former.</p>
                <p>Finally, the subject that permeated every aspect of the relationship among the
                    British, the United States, and the Irish was the Northern Ireland problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the embassy have any contacts, official or otherwise,
                        with the IRA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: No, the embassy had no contacts with the IRA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you personally able to travel to the North?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: I was, but only got there once. Our consul general in Belfast would come
                    to Dublin frequently because he didn't have any classified secretarial or cable
                    facilities. So, in order to get his encrypted stuff out, he had to come down to
                    us.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there for the Papal visit in '79?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes. It was a spectacular success, of course. Our ambassador's residence
                    overlooked the vast plain where the Pope and thousands of people were
                    celebrating Mass.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got an eagle eye view.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Actually, I wasn't there. I stayed in the embassy with a communicator in
                    case there was an emergency. Via television, I think I saw more than the people
                    in the Park did. In any case, other important classified matters were
                    transpiring at the same time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the effect of Irish membership in the
                        EuropeaCommunity? Did that tend to galvanize Ireland or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: I think its been a terrific plus for the Irish. Ireland is probably the
                    major beneficiary of the EC's Common Agricultural Policy, one of the keystones
                    of the Community, and of the first part of the glorious schemes of the European
                    Union that has really been put together and codified. The Irish were getting
                    back a lot more from the Community than they contributed to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any threats against the embassy or against
                        Americanwhile you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: The embassy frequently received telephone threats. Then the question
                    was, “Do we evacuate or not?” I was the one that had to make that decision in
                    most cases. We never evacuated. Sometimes one could hear “pub noises” in the
                    background of the caller. Once such threats resulted in an evacuation, they
                    would only increase.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the awful decisions a DCM is called on to
                        make.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: We had demonstrations as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they demonstrating against?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Against what they regarded as American opposition tunifying Ireland.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you swamped with American visitors a lot at the
                        embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: We had a lot, mainly Irish Americans. I remember one time when the
                    ambassador was out of the country, and I was charg�. There was a call from the
                    receptionist saying that there was a gentleman there who would like to see me. I
                    asked, “Who is he and what does he want?” She said, “He's from America, an Irish
                    American. He's never been in an American embassy and he's never seen an
                    ambassador.” I received him, took him around the embassy and, I think, made him
                    a friend for the Foreign Service. Senator Moynihan came by fairly frequently, as
                    did other Irish-American politicians, including Speaker of the House Tip
                    O'Neill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else we should say about your time in
                        Ireland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: The job was very interesting. I was charg� d'affaires for almost a year
                    because of delays in identifying and clearing appropriate ambassadorial
                    candidates in Washington.</p>
                <p>Q: In 1982, at the completion of your tour in Dublin, you came back to the
                    Department and joined the Management Policy staff, where you spent three years.
                    Who was the Director of the staff at that time?</p>
                <p>RUSHING: When I got back from Ireland, I didn't have an immediate assignment, but
                    what I was doing with others was solidified, and I became the Director of the
                    new Management Planning Staff. It was chartered to look into the future and try
                    to make predictions and plans for the role of the State Department in a new,
                    high-tech age, which would cover both foreign affairs and defense planning as
                    well as internal management.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many people did you have working with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: We had a budget of about $55 million and about 25 people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is a very sizable organization for the State
                        Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: It was really a breakthrough, something that Under Secretary for
                    Management Ron Spiers insisted on and was able to get money and people to do it.
                    The central office in the White House awarded State a special commendation for
                    excellence. One of the reasons why we were perhaps farther ahead than others was
                    because we started behind other agencies and were able to profit from their
                    experience.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Secretary Shultz take any interest in what was going
                        on owas he even aware of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes, he definitely was. As you know, one of his greatest interests was
                    to get what is now the National Foreign Affairs Training Center [NFATC]
                    established. But another, outside the main stream of daily foreign affairs, was
                    what we were doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give any examples that your staff came up with,
                        ideathat have been put into use or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: One of the things we were working on was what State shouldo if
                    Washington were threatened with destruction or actually destroyed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were able to work out some satisfactory...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: We were able to work out something. Happily, although we carried out
                    periodic exercises, we never had to actually implement our plans.</p>
                <p>Q: Let's hope we never do. What did the other bureaus and offices of the
                    Department think of your proposals and suggestions, or were they even exposed to
                    them at that time?</p>
                <p>RUSHING: Most of the bureaus and offices, at the top management level, were
                    briefed on our mission and activities, not on all of our activities, but those
                    that would affect them directly. Some of the people were very supportive and
                    encouraging and, in fact, contributed ideas to what we were doing. Others were
                    highly-critical.</p>
                <p>Q: I'm not surprised. After your three years on the Management Planning Staff,
                    you were transferred to our mission in Geneva in 1985. Tell me about that
                    position. What were you and to whom were you to report?</p>
                <p>RUSHING: After the exciting and challenging years as Director of the Management
                    Planning Staff, I learned of a new position that was being established in
                    Geneva. That was as Executive Assistant to our ambassador to the UN's offices in
                    Geneva. One of the reasons for establishing this new position was that the
                    Department wanted to be sure the U.S. was taking consistent positions in the
                    many different fora in Geneva.</p>
                <p>As you know, Geneva not only is the European headquarters of the United Nations,
                    but it hosts a multitude of different international agencies and activities:
                    GATT [General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs], WHO [World Health Organization],
                    ILO [International Labor Organization], Multilateral Commission on Disarmament,
                    bilateral arms reduction talks with the Soviets, etc. We could at any one time
                    have as many as eight different U.S. ambassadors in Geneva.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Another thing that was wanted was for someone to maintain close contact with our
                    discussions with the Russians, with the Soviets, on disarmament. In doing this,
                    I initially spent considerable time with the head of that activity there, at the
                    time, Max Kampelman. My job was not to put myself ahead of the mission's
                    ambassadors or DCM, but to make sure that the management activities of the
                    mission and that of the other elements of the United States Government
                    represented in Geneva were fully compatable.</p>
                <p>I expected to be transferred after the initial four-year assignment but two
                    successive ambassadors asked the Department to extend me. In fact, as we were
                    preparing to leave in 1991, the ambassador (my third) would have wanted me to
                    stay even longer, but I thought that six years were enough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: When we arrived there, the mission ambassador was Jerry Carmen. He had
                    been the head of the General Services Administration in Washington and was a
                    Republican activist in New England.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say he was effective in his role there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: He was very concerned with promoting American business interests and put
                    together a seminar on capitalism and private industry that was quite
                    successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long was he there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: He was only there for about a year after I arrived. I don't remember
                    when he came. He was succeeded by Joseph Petrone, who had retired from the Army
                    some years earlier as a colonel. He and his wife were very active in Republican
                    Party affairs. She was very able and engaging. They entertained graciously. He
                    was liked by everyone who knew him. Finally, there was Morris Abram, a New York
                    lawyer who came in '89. He had a remarkable ability to get along with people
                    while at the same time, he was very tough-minded, effective, and intelligent.
                    Perhaps he was one of our best ambassadors ever sent to Geneva.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our relation, the mission in Geneva, with our
                        embassy iBern?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>RUSHING: Well, there wasn't all that much, aside from protocol and social events.
                    The mission had little to do with the U.S. bilateral relationship with the
                    Swiss, which was handled by the embassy in Bern. There were some complications
                    concerning the operation of the Geneva office of Embassy Bern's Consular
                    Section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have relations with other missions in Geneva,
                        too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes. I forget how many missions were there but there were a lot, maybe
                    50 or 60. We saw their diplomatic personnel on a continuing basis, particularly
                    when we were trying to make some point, get something done that we wanted.</p>
                <p>Q: Did our various groupings there, or entities, get their instructions through
                    the Department of State or through their own agencies?</p>
                <p>RUSHING: It was complex and difficult to explain briefly. Most UN activities came
                    under the aegis of the U.S. ambassador in Geneva. I should say the “U.S. chief
                    of mission.” For, although there could be any number of U.S. ambassadors in
                    Geneva at one time, depending on what was going on (meetings, conferences),
                    there was only one U.S. chief of mission.</p>
                <p>This was not always well-understood and misunderstandings resulted. The
                    U.S.-Soviet bilateral disarmament negotiations were basically in a separate
                    capsule. The U.S. team had its own communicators, procedures, etc. Most of the
                    people in the mission saw little of their work. In the view of what happened
                    later with the collapse of the Soviet Union, Ambassador Petrone deserves praise
                    for being able to halt planning for the construction of a new, separate,
                    high-tech building solely dedicated to the bilateral arms negotiations at a
                    price of somewhere between $50 and $100 million.</p>
                <p>There were two (maybe I'm forgetting some others), U.S. Government residential
                    delegations which carried on their affairs—although UN-connected - separately
                    from the mission: the UN Conference on Disarmament and the GATT.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did USUN [U.S. Mission to the United Nations] play any
                        role ithis? Were they interested in what you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes. USUN was the mission's sister post back in New York and there were
                    some joint interests and activities. In many cases, however, the mission was
                    separate from what was going on in New York and visa versa. Our parent bureau in
                    the Department for most matters was IO [International Organizations].</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about instructions concerning labor or the health
                        matters?Would they be sent to Geneva directly from these bureaus in
                        State?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Theoretically, everything should have come out with IO'concurrence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you inundated with visitors, VIPs [very important
                        persons],Congressmen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: We had a lot. There was a branch of Geneva's Administrative Section that
                    did nothing except handle visitors and set up conferences. It had one officer
                    and, I think, three national employees.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So your role was more than just housekeeping.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: The role was more than just housekeeping.</p>
                <p>Q: So, six years of that and you were transferred back to this side of the
                    Atlantic to Norfolk, where you became Political Advisor. Was this to CINCLANT
                    [Commander in Chief, Atlantic] or SACLANT [Senior Allied Commander, Atlantic] or
                    both?</p>
                <p>RUSHING: To both. The U.S. admiral in Norfolk wears two hats. SACLANT is the NATO
                    command. CINCLANT is the American command. Both are focused on the Atlantic
                    although the CINCLANT territory is larger than the jurisdiction of SACLANT.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got to Norfolk, what did you find your duties to
                        be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: The Norfolk experience was not totally satisfactory. I was treated well,
                    both socially and professionally. But I was never clear what I should be
                    doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the Department or by the Navy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Neither.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fairly broad.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>RUSHING: I picked up and embroidered on what my predecessors had been doing. I
                    was told, “Everything's just fine.” Certainly the POLADs [political advisors]
                    coming out of World War II were stellar FSOs. Think of Bob Murphy. I think that
                    reflected that the military may not have known how to deal with the State
                    Department; they had limited experience in the areas of diplomacy and foreign
                    affairs. I have reflected on this and contrasted the year's training military
                    officers receive before taking up an Attach� job at an embassy with the few days
                    of briefings I received in Washington on my way to Norfolk. Over the years, the
                    military has become so sophisticated and so knowledgeable about how the foreign
                    affairs apparatus works that, in many cases, I don't think that they need a
                    political advisor anymore, except as an ornament, although I had had close
                    contacts with the U.S. military throughout my career, e.g. the sale of the F-16,
                    the Norfolk experience was discouraging.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To whom did you report?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Theoretically, only to the Commander in Chief, a four-staadmiral.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But practically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: I didn't report to anyone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Washington, State's Bureau of Political/Military
                        Affairs coulhave cared less?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Could have cared less.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They wanted to see the back of your head?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you got your instructions from them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: I didn't get any instructions and only an occasional query.</p>
                <p>Q: A rather interesting way to run an organization. When you sat in the staff
                    meetings with the Admiral and the other top Naval people, did you get the
                    impression that your views were listened to? Did they find you useful?</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>RUSHING: I don't know. Yes and no. One of the things that concerned me was that,
                    in these staff meetings, let's say, a Marine General, who was no friend of the
                    State Department, would say, “The State Department's position on this issue is
                    so and so.” I'd say, “Not so.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were making friends all over the place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: That was the problem. Then I would call up someone in the State
                    Department—almost never to PM. I'd call one of the geographic Desks and say,
                    “Hey, what's our position on this? Today in this meeting, this guy said it was
                    so-and-so.” The State guy would say, “No, it's not that way. It's this way.”
                    Which coincided with my prior understanding. My discussing this with State - to
                    rebut what I knew was not the case - was not appreciated by my colleagues at
                    Norfolk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have access to the top at Norfolk when you needed
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was being near to Washington, DC a help or a hindrance?
                        Woulyou have been better off if you'd been in Honolulu or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: I'm not sure but I think so, based on stories from other POLADs. One of
                    the things that worked was that I'd go to Washington about once every three or
                    four weeks and make the rounds (on a face to face basis) of all the people I had
                    business with. That was helpful in keeping up-to-date, but aside from correcting
                    Norfolk military misperceptions I'm not sure it added much to what was already
                    known. The most useful people were outside PM. I must say, however, that there
                    were not infrequent occasions when I could make a meaningful contribution that
                    could shorten Norfolk's reaction time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had no role in Desert Storm, and yet you could
                        probably sethe messages coming back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: I think Desert Storm was over by the time I got to Norfolin August
                    '91.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a role in Somalia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Somalia was run by Central Command out of Florida.CINCLANT provided
                    ships and Marines.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Haiti?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: That was ours. Most were pessimistic that anything was ever going to
                    work out there. At least in the short term, things seemed to be progressing, but
                    serious long-term political and economic problems remain that will not be
                    resolved in the foreseeable future. Most of the planning of a possible U.S.
                    invasion was done at CINCLANT. I had little to do with it. I was concerned what
                    the relationship of our military would be with the Haitian people themselves. I
                    don't know whether I had any effect on that or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get to go to Haiti?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: No, I didn't. With the possible exception of clandestine visits, no one
                    went to Haiti from CINCLANT that I'm aware of, during my time there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when we called off the ship that was about
                        to land?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: No, I wasn't in Norfolk. I was back in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That story remains to be told. How about Cuba? Was that a
                        biissue while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes. I stayed in touch very closely with the Cuba Desk in the State
                    Department. We had ongoing discussion and planning among the Departments of
                    State and Defense and CINCLANT.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Russian Navy? Was that a great concern to
                        us athe time or not? They're prowling CINCLANT waters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Oh, yes, they are—they were anyway. Of course, the perceived Soviet
                    naval threat had diminished by that time. We still monitored their movements
                    very carefully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you accompany the Admiral on any trips?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: Yes, Brussels several times, Iceland, different places ithe Caribbean,
                    Rome, the Azores.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>Q: Your tour in Norfolk ended in '93 and you came back to the Department for a
                    period. You worked on Special Projects in S/S. What did that involve?</p>
                <p>RUSHING: I joined a small group of senior officers in S/S that was looking at a
                    new way to automatically declassify messages, to get rid of a lot of top secret,
                    very sensitive messages that ended up in S/S for filing and just stayed there
                    forever. We did devise a way to accomplish this: both declassification and
                    destruction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To whom did you report?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: To the Executive Secretary of the State Department, thhead of S/S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And after that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: I retired in April '94 after attending the retiremencourse, which was
                    very well done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back on those forty years, did the Foreign Service
                        livup to your expectations when you entered?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: It did at the beginning but became less so as time went by. I told our
                    two sons, who are now in their 30s, that they should consider the Foreign
                    Service, but my advice would be not to seek it as a career. In the event, the
                    older is a district sales manager for the Johnson &amp; Johnson subsidiary that
                    makes Tylenol; the younger is a managing director of an investment bank in
                    London.</p>

                        What dyou look back upon as the most effective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUSHING: I think one of the things that I tried to do in Laos was to dampen down
                    the war and not exaggerate what U.S. military force could achieve in Southeast
                    Asia. I was not successful, but I made a try.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were pushing a terrible boulder uphill. Any other
                        commentyou'd like to make about the Service or about places where you
                        were?</hi>

                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>RUSHING: I think my job as Director of the Management Planning staff was
                    fascinating and important to the U.S. as a whole. I liked what I was doing in
                    Denmark very much, including the sale of the F-16 and our coverage and demarches
                    made during Denmark's tenure of the EC presidency. My year's tenure as charg� in
                    Dublin was particularly challenging. Although I'm not sanguine about the future
                    of the Foreign Service, it's somewhat paradoxical that I've liked almost all the
                    places that I have been and the jobs I've had.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, I want to thank you, Charlie, for this very interesting discussion we've
                    had. This is Tom Dunnigan and the date is July 2, 1996.</p>
