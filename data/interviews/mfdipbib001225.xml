                <p>AMBASSADOR RICHARD N. VIETS</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 6, 1990</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is April 6, 1990. This is an interview with
                        Ambassador Richard N. Viets on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies. I am Charles Stuart Kennedy. I wonder if you could give me a little
                        about your background—when your were born, where you come from, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I was born and raised, Mr. Kennedy, outside a tiny village in northern
                    Vermont, a place called Hyde Park.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that in the Northeast Kingdom?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: It sits in the underbelly of the Northeast Kingdom. It is sort of midway
                    in the northern part of the State of Vermont between Burlington and St.
                    Johnsbury.</p>
                <p>I was “educated” in one of those classic schools where there were three grades to
                    a room. You had the benefit as a first grader of doing third grade work and as a
                    fourth grader doing sixth grade work. I remember once writing a brief
                    autobiography claiming that my principal education had taken place in a one room
                    school house in Vermont, which was a slight elaboration on the truth. But it was
                    a great way to...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know. My wife comes from Sheffield, Vermont.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, things have changed since then, but that was the way I started. I
                    subsequently had an appointment to West Point and was going to be a West
                    Pointer. About a month before the plebe summer started I was involved in a bad
                    accident and the Army, or at least, West Point wouldn't touch me. I went home to
                    recuperate from this accident in Vermont. After a couple of months I enrolled as
                    a special student in the University of Vermont...part time because I couldn't go
                    to school full time at that point.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>The Korean War broke out—this would have been September 1950—and I had been too
                    young to participate in World War II. I was in the middle of what I characterize
                    as my “Hemingway phase” in that period of my life and was certain that no man
                    could understand life without having seen and participated in war. So I lied
                    about my condition and situation and joined a reserve Army unit that had been
                    called to active duty to go to Korea. I ended up not in Korea but in
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>When I finished the Army, a little less then two years later, and went back to
                    school...I came down here to Georgetown, I went again to the University of
                    Vermont, I was at Harvard for a while, I studied out on the West Coast and a
                    little bit in Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You really bounced around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I was a little ahead of my time...academic trampism! I finally concluded
                    enough was enough.</p>
                <p>I had been out on the West Coast working for the Bank of America and later
                    building custom kitchens for homes of movie stars, when I encountered a young
                    lady whom I had known in Germany some years earlier and I followed her back to
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>I encountered on the street, Pennsylvania and 17th Street, an old college
                    classmate who was just walking out of what was then USIA headquarters at 1776
                    Pennsylvania Avenue. He had just taken an oral examination to enter the USIA
                    junior officer training program. I was at loose ends. The young lady in question
                    had come back here for treatment of cancer and had just died. I thought on the
                    spur of the moment that USIA sounded like a good idea.</p>
                <p>So I walked in and went through the necessary examinations and somewhat to my
                    surprise received a letter several months later from USIA telling me that I had
                    been accepted and was being assigned as a junior office trainee to Kabul,
                    Afghanistan. This was in 1955. I was back in Vermont staying with my parents at
                    that time having a great life as a ski bum. I can remember going to the
                    Encyclopedia Britannica to look up Kabul to see just where it was. I didn't
                    know.</p>
                <p>I subsequently went to Kabul and spent a wonderful year there. In many respects,
                    as so often happens with a young person on their first post, it was a
                    fascinating period. From there I went to Tunis. In those times USIA had an
                    interesting approach in training their junior officers. They felt that in order
                    to test the mettle of their officer candidates, they ought to be thrust into two
                    very different cultures and environments in the course of a two-year overseas
                    assignment. And they were also concerned that junior officers work for at least
                    two supervisors in their first assignment in order to mitigate any prejudice one
                    way or another on the prospects and potential of each officer candidate.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you being run out of USIA at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: In Washington, yes. I arrived in Tunis, I think about a week after Tunis
                    had become independent. I recall that when you got out into the countryside in
                    Tunisia into some of those small desert towns, the French tricolor was still
                    flying from the local mayor's office.</p>
                <p>It was also a time, of course, when the Algerian revolution was gaining force and
                    the FLN had their headquarters almost in my back yard. So it was the
                    revolutionary phase, one of them, of my Foreign Service career.</p>
                <p>I spent a little over a year in Tunis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you a couple questions first about Kabul and
                        then about Tunis. In Kabul...we are talking about the mid-fifties which is
                        pretty isolated. The Afghans as has become very apparent to everybody, the
                        British earlier on and the Russians much later, aren't very susceptible to
                        anybody. What does a young, brand new USIA officer do there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I am sure that my USIA masters have probably long since departed from this
                    world so I can be very truthful! I think the answer is, precious little in terms
                    of advancing the interests at that time of USIA. I had the advantage of being
                    the youngest person on that Embassy staff and I was also a bachelor. So I was
                    the clean up hitter of the staff and always the guy who was available to do what
                    nobody else wanted to tend to.</p>
                <p>Our Ambassador at that time was a remarkable character by the name of Angus
                    Ward.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to ask. He is one of the remarkable people in
                        the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: A memorable person. Ambassador Ward was in the final phase of his own
                    career. He disliked what he called the capital life...that is, staying in Kabul.
                    He had two major obsessions in his life at that point, and indeed they were
                    obsessions. One was to complete work on a Mongolian-English dictionary and the
                    second was to complete the mapping of certain areas of the northern reaches of
                    Afghanistan which the British had never gotten around to doing. He had brought
                    to Afghanistan a custom-built International Harvester safari wagon. These things
                    are rather common now days, but in those days it was quite a vehicle. It had
                    extra gas tanks, and water tanks, etc. We would go out for weeks at a time...we
                    being me as his sort of aide-de-camp, his driver and a bearer and cook, to put
                    up the tent and make the meals.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>It was a wonderful education for me because I can remember so many nights sitting
                    around a campfire up in the Hindu Kush listening to this man relive his career,
                    which as you will recall was essentially in China and in the Soviet Union, with
                    one major break prior to coming to Afghanistan in Kenya where he often said he
                    got very bored with the Mau Mau rebellion and wanted to come to Afghanistan
                    where things were really happening.</p>
                <p>I also spent a great deal of time traveling around Afghanistan with our military
                    attach� who was probably the most intelligent person I ever knew in the armed
                    services. Alas, several years later he blew his brains out. His reporting
                    requirements out of Washington necessitated his spending a great deal of time
                    moving around the country, and especially the northern areas. The Soviets at
                    that point were just beginning their rocket testing program and one of their
                    bases was not too far north of the border.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up concern about the Soviets trying to
                        get into Afghanistan? If so, what were we doing about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: That is a good question. You may recall that in 1955, Khrushchev and
                    Bulganin came to Afghanistan, to Kabul, and dropped the equivalent of a $100
                    million economic grant in the lap of the Afghans. That was the first, in my
                    recollection, major Soviet foreign aid program outside of what we then called
                    the Iron Curtain, that is Eastern Europe. In many respects, I think, the Soviet
                    rule book on how to run an economic assistance program was written in
                    Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>Yes, we were extremely concerned at that point about Soviet influence in
                    Afghanistan. In retrospect, one needed much more of an historical understanding
                    of the region than it seemed to me we were demonstrating in those days. You
                    recall it was the era of the Baghdad Pact. I remember great efforts being made
                    to sign up everybody along the so-called “northern periphery” to the Baghdad
                    Pact. The Afghans would have nothing to do with it, of course.</p>
                <p>But there were two central concerns. One was Afghanistan's strategic position as
                    the throughway between the subcontinent and Western Europe and secondly, as I
                    say, there were some major interest in what was going on on the other side of
                    the border in the world of rockets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Ward who had been in prison in Mukden and had
                        served in the Soviet Union...here was probably as good a man as any to be in
                        this place. Obviously he must have known the history of the area well and
                        was not a Washington cold warrior. How did he view Soviet influence in
                        Afghanistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>VIETS: He, in fact, was in the final process of tuning out his career. I don't
                    recall, I'm sure we must have had discussions on this, but his principal
                    interests in those days didn't relate to the contemporary political, social,
                    economic problems in Afghanistan. He was in an anecdotal phase of his life and I
                    wish I had had the same tape recorder you have in front of me now. I would have
                    had a hell of a book out of it. As I said he spent as little time as possible in
                    Kabul. When he was there he spent a great deal of time in his house.</p>
                <p>He was quite a skilled craftsman with wood. I remember ...he knew that he was
                    retiring so he started a big program of building packing cases for what was a
                    40-50 year collection of things. He was married to a white Russian lady of
                    formidable dimensions and pretensions. I don't remember, but it seems to me
                    something like 350 packing cases were produced. All of them of cabinet craftsman
                    quality.</p>
                <p>I recall when he finally left...our Army attach� had two huge trucks that were
                    used to haul food and other things needed by the Embassy from Peshawar, which
                    was our depot for all of our sea pouches and food shipments, etc. In those days
                    very little was available in the bazaar of Afghanistan, unlike today. These
                    trucks were shuttled back and forth a couple of times a month. They were
                    commandeered by the Ambassador to take his shipment of 300 odd packing cases
                    down to Karachi to catch a ship back to Europe. He was retiring in southern
                    Spain, where he intended to take his safari wagon into the Sahara and do mapping
                    work there.</p>
                <p>By then I had surely become the American equivalent of the ADC and was asked to
                    accompany the two trucks to insure that nothing untoward happened. You can
                    imagine that over the years he had amassed an extraordinary collection of
                    artifacts. A great deal of stuff came out of China which obviously was valuable.
                    We were to go down to Karachi with these trucks and then link up with the
                    Ambassador and his wife and get them on board ship and away. This was about a
                    week's journey overland. It was a long haul and the roads were such that you had
                    to go pretty carefully. But I recall finally getting down there and linking up
                    with the Ambassador.</p>
                <p>The morning the ship was sailing...the MV Victoria, I still remember, one of the
                    old Lloyd Triestino ships that sailed from Hong Kong to Singapore, to Bombay,
                    Karachi, to Aden for refueling and then on to Italy...Naples. One would go to
                    Naples and the other would go up to Venice and Trieste.</p>
                <p>In any case we went down to the port in Karachi...the Ward family had a
                    collection of three or four beautiful cats. I am sorry I don't recall whether
                    they were Russian, Siamese or what. I am not a cat fancier. But they were
                    gorgeous creatures. I recall that the pouch room at the Embassy had been raided
                    by the Ambassador and he had taken away two large sea pouches and had cut air
                    holes in them. Those bags had leather handles on them for easy carrying. Two
                    cats were put into each bag. I was assigned the task as we got out of the cars
                    at the port of carrying these bags on board.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>The gangway was a rather rickety affair, I remember, and it swung back and forth.
                    I was directly behind Mrs. Ward who was of a certain age and size as I suggested
                    earlier and I recall hanging the two sea bags over the sides of the gangway and
                    trying to use my elbows to steady poor Mrs. Ward who was having difficulty
                    climbing the gangway.The Ambassador was right behind me and about halfway up as
                    we were swinging back and forth and the cats are meowing and Mrs. Ward was
                    complaining, he roared at me, “God damn it, Viets, never mind my wife watch
                    those cats!”</p>
                <p>I could go on with many more anecdotes like this...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I like getting these stories because people like
                        Ward die out unless we get something in writing. Well, going on to Tunis.
                        What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I used to talk about myself as deputy head of the USIA office in Tunis. In
                    fact there were two of us there! As I said, this was just at the moment of
                    Tunisian independence so the Tunisians were scrambling about looking for
                    assistance in every single area of governmental and private activity you could
                    think of. So our agency operation there was a very busy one. Lots and lots of
                    people were coming from the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tunisia had gained its independence fairly
                        peacefully.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: That's right. Habib Bourguiba was the great figure at that point and for
                    many years after.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My understanding is that he had a very strong positive
                        feeling towards the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: He did. He was a tremendous admirer of President Eisenhower, who was in
                    office at that point. Despite what one would have to say had been a spotty, if
                    not questionable, record of American subservience to French colonial policy in
                    North Africa for a considerable period leading up to Tunisian independence,
                    Bourguiba was a great admirer of many aspects of the United States and its
                    institutions. In consequence, we had ready access to him and, I like to think, a
                    certain amount of influence.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Our access to him was immeasurably enhanced by the fact that we had on our staff
                    at that point, the USIA staff, an extraordinary woman who was a Polish, a
                    displaced person, who Bourguiba had almost “adopted” as a daughter. There was a
                    period, I recall, when he would not receive anyone who couldn't talk to him in
                    French or Arabic, without her acting as an interpreter. This lady, I should add
                    for the record, subsequently, became my wife. So I have a certain bias in my
                    description of events. But she played a very, very interesting role during that
                    period in our relationship not only with Bourguiba, but in a sense even more
                    importantly with the FLN political leadership. But that is another story and one
                    which I don't want to get into here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like whatever you can say. There was a tremendous
                        debate within the American government over what we should do about Algeria
                        because you had the European Bureau saying, “Look, we don't want to mess
                        around with NATO, we have to keep the French happy.” This led to our
                        problems with Indonesia too. Yet at the same time the colonial situation,
                        even in those days it was pretty obvious that this thing was not going to go
                        on. Algeria was hopelessly divided with a very strong colonial element
                        there. What were we doing</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Your characterization is absolutely accurate. The Europeanists in the
                    State Department were the dominant force until quite late in the day in North
                    Africa, in our relationships with the incipient North African independent
                    governments and institutions. The historians may quarrel with me, but it seems
                    to me that this period marked the beginning of a structural change in the
                    American government's pro-French orientation of “well, it is their backyard and
                    we shouldn't mess in it since we have all these NATO obligations, etc.” Also a
                    lot of just plain Francophonism, if one can coin that word, I think drove a
                    great deal of our North African policy. But a seminal event in my memory at that
                    time was a speech on the floor of the Senate by a man named Jack Kennedy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Senator from Massachusetts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Who was the Senator from Massachusetts. I think that speech was in 1954.
                    It rang alarm bells that the law of diminishing returns was beginning to set in
                    by our almost blind support of a very myopic French colonial policy in Northern
                    Africa. I don't think that is over-stating the situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I don't either.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: In later years of my career, as you know, I spent a certain amount of time
                    working in Israel and Jordan and I saw so many segments of Israeli society
                    acting, behaving, thinking in much the same manner that many of the French
                    “Colon” did during the 1950's.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>In any case, in answer to your question, obviously we had to adhere to the policy
                    lines laid down by our political masters in Washington. But I can recall
                    vigorous dissent messages flowing back and forth for the first months of my time
                    there. Our mission was still a consulate general. We had not been elevated to an
                    embassy, even though the country was independent. Again, our Embassy in Paris, I
                    remember, had a hand in insuring that this did not happen for many months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To get a little feel of the atmosphere, did you sort of
                        look upon the Embassy in Paris as being overly sophisticated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: We certainly looked upon it as being an extension of the policy interests
                    of the Quai d'Orsay. One has always to understand that emotions in such
                    circumstances can run very high. And they did! But you see these issues through
                    rather small sets of political, social binoculars. And as I look back on it, I
                    realize this was really my first introduction to the frustrations of disagreeing
                    with policies handed down from on high. I don't want to put too fine a point on
                    this or mislead anyone who reviews these records, but in our defiance of
                    Washington and our embassy in Paris I think we sailed pretty close to the edge
                    in Tunis during this period in finding creative ways to deal with the “outlaw”
                    FLN leadership in Tunis through various emissaries, including Bourguiba. My late
                    wife was very active in this regard...she wasn't a US citizen so she wasn't
                    under the same constraints we were. But we did not spend a great deal of time
                    informing Washington of those activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the type of thing that I think is good for
                        somebody to understand the record, that there is an awful lot going on out
                        there that just won't get in the record. Most people are individuals and
                        have their own agendas and see things. The Secretary of State may make his
                        orders, but the written ones are rather meager out in the field.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>How about with the Tunisians? Here you are with USIA talking about America. This
                    must have been rather difficult. It is hard for us to get away from our
                    independence as a former colony and then to sort of cool it when we talk about
                    French colonialism.</p>
                <p>VIETS: It was extremely difficult and again I was so often reminded in the last
                    years of my career...working with the Israel-Arab conflict and the Palestinian
                    problem...of exactly the same dilemma of having to work within the constraints
                    of a policy laid down by the President and the Secretary of State and the
                    Congress looking over your shoulder constantly and constantly interfering—
                    policies with which you found yourself sometimes in major disagreement. It
                    creates plenty of creative tension in the profession! And on occasion when you
                    felt yourself veering too far towards the edge you ask yourself, “Should I get
                    out?” You are still a loyal soldier, but where do you draw the line?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the Tunisians was this coming up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Yes, constantly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Every time you saw a Tunisian, Algeria came up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Absolutely. As I say, you had to be creative while still attempting to be
                    fundamentally loyal to policy. We were able and I think more so perhaps in those
                    days than now because there weren't quite so many layers of people then between
                    you and the senior policy level in the Department and the White House to make
                    our arguments and then hope that those arguments were registering and getting
                    through. And over a period of time the policy changes, of course. In the case of
                    Tunisia how much of a policy correction was due to our efforts as opposed to
                    broader considerations of policy, is somebody's doctoral thesis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You certainly were absorbing in these two years two quite
                        different atmospheres.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: That's right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave Tunis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I left in July or August, 1957. I had become frustrated by the US
                    Information Agency. It seemed to me that it was becoming very sclerotic in its
                    management of itself. In those days there were still a great many hangers on
                    from the old Office of War Information, in senior managerial positions of the
                    Information Agency. These people were all approaching retirement but they were
                    still running things. There were a lot of cold warriors. There were a lot of
                    people who weren't, in my judgment, terribly competent. It seemed to me that it
                    was an organization that had a dead hand. I became very impatient with it. I was
                    young and impatient in any case. So I resigned. I had enjoyed a very rapid run
                    with them. They were very liberal in their promotions and all that. But I
                    decided I did not have the patience to wait for these people to move on into
                    retirement.</p>
                <p>I also had a very itchy foot and was still a bachelor. I had been exposed on
                    several occasions over the last couple of years to a government program called
                    the Office of International Trade Fairs. This organization operated in the most
                    wonderful free-wheeling manner you can imagine. The GAO, General Auditing
                    Office, would jump off the roof today if any office ran itself like the Trade
                    Fairs office did in those days. I thought this would be great fun for a couple
                    of years to just wheel and deal around the world putting up trade fairs. So I
                    joined them and spent the next two years hurtling around the globe in Europe,
                    Asia and the Middle East, doing this.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>I ended up in India and in 1960 decided enough was enough...in late 1959 I
                    married the remarkable Polish lady that I mentioned earlier and realized this
                    was no life for her. So I resigned from the government, joined the Mobil
                    International Oil Company and spent the next 18 months or so working with Mobil,
                    ending up in Paris. But I increasingly realized that, to quote old Joe Kennedy's
                    famous dictum, there is no fun in chasing the buck, or something like that...I
                    found making money a very boring world in which to operate. However necessary
                    money may be, unless you are awfully lucky, making it is not terribly
                    interesting, and I had had an interesting life up until that point and it seemed
                    to me to spend my days talking with petroliers in France about the need to
                    change the oil in their airplanes more frequently was not terribly exciting or
                    intellectually stimulating.</p>
                <p>My wife and I went on a holiday to Sardinia in the summer of 1961. I was one of
                    the early scuba divers and a great devotee of Jacques Cousteau. I sat on the
                    bottom of the Mediterranean off the coast of Sardinia for a week, coming up for
                    air, of course, occasionally, just working out my future. I finally decided that
                    what I wanted to do was to join the Foreign Service. I was thirty years old at
                    that point and going on thirty-one. That was a period when thirty-one was the
                    cutoff point. So I quickly took the exams and passed and got in just under the
                    wire. Because of my “business” background, and some trade experience, it was a
                    logical thing that my first assignment to Tokyo was as a commercial officer.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VIETS: That is slightly misleading in that we departed just before Christmas
                    1962, arriving at the end of the year.</p>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>VIETS: I am sorry, I am misinterpreting you, I came in as a lateral entrant. In
                    those days one took what was the same oral examination that an FSO candidate
                    would take, what they waived was the written exam. I vividly remember the day I
                    took the exam. There was a wonderful French restaurant across the street from
                    the building I was to be tested in on 17th street. Unhappily, it has long since
                    disappeared. My exam was scheduled for 2:30 in the afternoon. I had a certain
                    apprehension because I knew if I failed, that would mark the end of my Foreign
                    Service aspirations because I would be thirty-one in a couple of months. So I
                    invited to lunch a ravishing lady, a friend of my wife and I, and we sat across
                    the street out on the terrace of this restaurant and consumed a couple of
                    wonderful bottles of white wine.</p>
                <p>I sort of lurched into the examination room feeling absolutely no pain.
                    Fortunately in those days exams were held with the examiners sitting behind a
                    long table on one side and you sat on the other. So I sat with my hand over my
                    mouth hoping that nobody would pick up the vapors. I think I had had just enough
                    to drink to be sufficiently articulate and I got through the ordeal all
                    right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then went to Tokyo. What was the commercial situation
                        and what were you doing at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I was thinking about this the other day because I was at dinner with a
                    distinguished American lawyer who had just come back from a couple of years in
                    Tokyo and we were trading comments and reminiscences.</p>
                <p>In those days Japan was still in its pre-pubescent period. The Japanese were
                    still very busy copying things. They were already well into the radio and
                    television business, but nobody wanted their cars. The Japanese didn't think
                    much of their cars. I remember bringing an American Ford car there and crowds
                    would gather around it out in the countryside. It was a cheap American Ford, but
                    it was always greeted with great appreciation.</p>
                <p>I have always thought that the threshold of Japan's transition to a mature
                    industrial society really was marked by the Olympics in 1964. It seemed to me
                    from that point onward, the Japanese suddenly demonstrated a self assurance in a
                    societal sense that we hadn't earlier seen. They had labored night and day,
                    seven days a week, in Tokyo for several years prior to the Olympics in changing
                    the face of the city. Everything suddenly seemed to come together for the
                    Japanese. They became increasingly important players in the international
                    marketplace. They were becoming more assertive in their relationships with us.
                    They grew up. It was for that reason an especially interesting period to be
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>It was made all the more exciting because we had as our Ambassador one of the
                    more remarkable men I have ever worked for, Edwin O. Reischauer, the famous
                    Japanese, Chinese scholar from Harvard. I think the United States was
                    inordinately fortunate to have him as our principal representative to that
                    country at that period because he was very much a father figure for the
                    Japanese. They paid great heed to his advice and counsel. He was a very wise,
                    exceedingly competent man. I think his contributions to the Japanese transition
                    from a sort of occupation mentality into a more normal relationship with us have
                    never fully been appreciated either by policy makers or by historians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your responsibilities and how did you see him as
                        he related to the commercial side of things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Unlike almost any of the other politically appointed chiefs of mission
                    that I either worked for or saw at close distance over the ensuing years, there
                    was very little in the Embassy that didn't interest Ambassador Reischauer.</p>
                <p>We had established as part of our Embassy operations at that point, indeed it was
                    one of the reasons I was sent there, a trade center, where every six weeks we
                    mounted a major exhibition. The center was a display case for American products.
                    I remember that the Ambassador took a very keen interest in that operation. He
                    was always there for openings and often came over to see how things were going,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>He was also very much personally involved in negotiations in the economic arena.
                    He, of course, was essentially bilingual in Japanese-English, but he used a very
                    clever device. If he were in a press conference, for example, with Japanese
                    journalists, he used the principal Embassy interpreter to do the English to
                    Japanese portions of the affair. And, you could rest assured there would be
                    several points in the course of this exceedingly proficient interpreter's
                    rendition of what Reischauer had said when the Ambassador would interrupt him in
                    Japanese and say, “Now that is not quite the right shade of meaning that you
                    have given to this, rather it is etc. etc.” Of course, the Japanese just loved
                    this because it revealed his inner knowledge of the most refined elements of
                    that very sophisticated language. A remarkable man in many respects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Working for Commerce at that time, what sort of
                        instructions were you getting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: The Commerce Department, I think, was essentially a reflection of the
                    general American attitude toward Japan at that point. That is, Japan was an
                    important potential market for American exports. We were beginning to worry
                    about our trade deficit. My recollection is that in those years we had a
                    shocking global trade deficit of something like $18-20 billion a year...we would
                    be on our hands and knees if we could get it down to that today.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>So Commerce's view of Japan was almost exclusively focused on exports. I must say
                    it was rinky-dink stuff that Commerce was focusing on. I have no particular
                    respect, looking back on that period, for the competence and vision and
                    foresight of the people in the Department of Commerce or State, for that matter,
                    on what was coming down the pike. I can remember those of us on the commercial
                    staff...we had six or seven American officers, it was a large
                    establishment...were principally devoted to kind of hand holding American
                    businessmen who were visiting Japan for the first time. We were involved in
                    explaining distribution systems and patent office problems and MITT, the
                    Ministry of Industry and Trade, and arranging appointments, etc. There was no
                    real understanding that the Japanese industrial juggernaut was gathering steam
                    and would soon be rolling down the road over everything in front of it.</p>
                <p>I do recall, however, working on a major study that Commerce never asked for but
                    we decided we should do, on the fledgling Japanese automobile industry and the
                    potential it had for becoming a major player in the global marketplace. I
                    haven't, of course, read that despatch in many years, but I think we
                    demonstrated surprising foresight in our predictions on what was going to
                    happen. I can remember the study reaching Washington and eliciting
                    guffaws...what were those young guys smoking?</p>
                <p>So we had it all wrong. We didn't understand very well. And when I say “we” I am
                    really speaking of the policy makers here. Those of us out there in Tokyo
                    realized what was happening, although perhaps not with all the vision that there
                    should have been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To move on, you then were assigned...you were going to
                        spend quite a bit of time in India. First in Madras (1965-67) and New Delhi
                        (1967-72). What were you doing in Madras?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Again, I was assigned there as a commercial officer. It took me a little
                    more than five minutes to realize that the potential for American exports in
                    South India during that period was so limited as to perhaps occupy an American
                    officer's activities about five or ten percent of the time. Fortunately, several
                    months after my arrival, a State Department inspection team blew into town as
                    part of their overall India inspection tour, and I was able to prevail on their
                    good sense that this position should be abolished.</p>
                <p>Our Consulate General in Madras covers a territory about the size of West
                    Germany, four southern states of India, with, I think, a population of about 400
                    million people. That meant a great deal of travel. Again, I happened to be
                    fortunate enough to be working with a group of people who didn't like to be away
                    from their homes too frequently, so I spent a lot of time moving around south
                    India, which is a fascinating part of the world. In consequence, I did a lot of
                    both political and economic reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our interests in that area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Again, and this is always hard for anyone today to understand the passions
                    which drove so much of American policy and preoccupied and dominated the
                    activities of so many American posts abroad, one of the major preoccupations was
                    our concern about Soviet influence in India. It was certainly a legitimate
                    concern, but should never have become a dominant concern. We had a huge
                    intelligence representation in India at that point. We spent an awful lot of
                    time monitoring what the Soviets were doing, and they spent an awful lot of time
                    monitoring what we were doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was India sort of going on despite it all like Old Man
                        River?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Yes. But you will recall this was also an important era of India's own
                    political history. Nehru had just passed from the scene. Prime Minister Shastri
                    had succeeded him. Shastri was a rather weak figure who, you may recall, died of
                    a heart attack while on a trip to Tashkent. To many people's surprise, within
                    the US establishment at least, a lady named Indira Gandhi succeeded him.</p>
                <p>She was clearly the candidate of the political bosses in India at that point.
                    They thought they were going to be able to dominate her and manipulate events as
                    they desired.So we also devoted quite a lot of time trying to figure out whither
                    India in political, economic and philosophical terms. We were still hoping that
                    we could influence the Indians to embrace the so-called market economy, which we
                    called private enterprise in those days. So a lot of time was spent working with
                    American businessmen and Indian politicians who were favorably disposed to
                    freeing up the economy from its layers and layers of British inspired
                    bureaucracy and Indian refinements thereof.</p>
                <p>There was also a major presence throughout India of USIA. We had library
                    operations in those days in Trivandrum down in Kerala State...in each of the
                    capitals of the four southern Indian states that our consular district
                    embraced.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mention Kerala State. This was one of those red
                        blotches on the map.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Kerala had a “Communist” government. That was a period in which there had
                    been a major split in the Communist Party between a faction of the party that
                    supported Moscow and a faction which supported Beijing. So you had this
                    wonderful CPI, Communist Party of India, divided into two groups. One was what
                    we called “Right” and one was “Left,” “Right” being Moscow. We wasted a lot of
                    time on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure there were other things we could have been doing,
                        but in those days the word “communism” would suck us into paying too much
                        attention to it at the expense of other issues.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: We did have some major American economic projects going on. I should have
                    said at the outset that another big preoccupation, certainly mine, was our AID
                    program, economic assistance program, in India which at that point was of a
                    value of hundreds and hundreds of millions of dollars. Much of it was in the
                    form of food aid. In 1966-67, India went through a very severe famine and the
                    United States came to India's rescue in a stupendously generous fashion. I can
                    remember going down to the port in Madras and looking out and seeing 70, 80
                    American ships sitting at anchor filled with grain waiting to come into the
                    port.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the delivery system? Often getting grain to the
                        right place is crucial.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Compared to other parts of the world that I lived in I think it was
                    relatively efficient. The Indians had, thanks to the British, an extremely good
                    rail network which covered all of south India. And their road system also was
                    still in relatively good shape. The grain losses in India were in the storage of
                    it where rats and weevils get to it. Often, as you know, it would just be stored
                    outside. There were inadequate covered storage facilities. But in terms of
                    transporting and distributing those food grains to feed hungry people and their
                    hungry live stock, I think one has to give very high marks to the Indians for
                    the way they handled the crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in Madras what was the attitude of the
                        officers you worked with and your own attitude towards the Indians? Was it
                        positive or sort of “Oh my God, these are difficult people”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I think both of the above. I had a life long love affair with India, less
                    so with Indians, but certainly with the country. It is such a fascinating series
                    of cultures and civilizations. The topography is magnificent, of course, from
                    the Himalayas to the coast lines. All those wonderful hill stations, tea
                    plantations, etc.</p>
                <p>I think that no American who has served in India has not left considerably older
                    because of the need to find secret reservoirs of patience and understanding
                    which he might not have had when he came. But also I doubt if any American who
                    really made the effort to get out and know something about India hasn't left
                    much the richer for it. It is a remarkable civilization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a difference between when you were in Madras and
                        moving around attitude towards Americans and all than there was when you got
                        up to New Delhi which is much more a capital which often reflects the
                        central party, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>VIETS: Yes. To begin with south Indians...there are major Christian communities
                    in south India, especially in Kerala, so there exists a different ethic towards
                    such things as private enterprise in south India than in north India. South
                    Indians are a more sophisticated, in a sense more worldly group of people than
                    the north Indians are. These are terrible generalizations but there is some
                    validity to them, I think.</p>
                <p>But you put your finger on, I think, the principal differences...in New Delhi you
                    were in a capital with layers of bureaucrats and politicians many of whom were
                    not very competent and were driven by the most confused and confusing economic
                    and political philosophies. We were all, ourselves, under the spell of Chester
                    Bowles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was Ambassador there from 1963-69.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, he was Ambassador there twice. I got him the second time around. He
                    had amassed...it was a very large mission in those days in New Delhi...and he
                    had amassed without question the most capable group of people I ever worked with
                    anywhere during my Foreign Service career, which certainly includes the city of
                    Washington! He had an eye for talent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How old were some of those people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, for example, the current head of National Public Radio was one of
                    his people; the current head of AIPAC, Tom Dine was one of his people; the
                    current head of the Foreign Service Institute [Brandon Grove] was one of his
                    people; there must have been 30 or 40 future ambassadors who were on his staff;
                    the Governor of Ohio, Dick Celeste, was one of his people. The Foreign Service
                    today, at least my generation, is just studded with Bowles graduates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his method of operation and how did you view him
                        in his relations with the Indians?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>VIETS: It is a complicated question and a complicated answer and I will try to
                    simplify it by saying that he was impassioned to imbue American principles and
                    ideals into the Indian political consciousness and mainstream. He was a great
                    democrat, as you know, both in terms of being a great member of the Democratic
                    Party, and a democrat in the political philosophical sense of the word as well.
                    A man of formidable intellect and energy and that combination always, of course,
                    is nothing to trifle with. So he worked seven days a week, eighteen or twenty
                    hours a day, coming up with idea, after idea, after idea, on how to knit US
                    institutions with Indian institutions. He always said that he got much of his
                    inspiration from his pattern of surrounding himself with fairly young, energetic
                    people. We were all in our 30s or early 40s at that point. Once or twice a week
                    he would have eight or ten of us to his home for dinner and we would sit out
                    there in that lovely back garden of his and argue far into the night with him. I
                    had two wonderful years with him in that garden listening to argument, debate
                    and dissent on everything under the sun that was going on, both in India and
                    elsewhere. As a consequence, he missed very few tricks and we, as a consequence,
                    were the beneficiaries of a lot of practical political wisdom on his part. He
                    was one of the most open ambassadors I have ever known. If he had just come from
                    spending a couple of hours with the Prime Minister, we would hear about the most
                    privileged elements of that conversation. This was not always true in other
                    embassies in which I served. But his influence led me to try to emulate him in
                    many ways when I became an Ambassador.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you think your work related to the Indians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: They were devoted to him. Partly because they felt they had co-opted him,
                    and certainly much of the bureaucracy in Washington was convinced of this fact,
                    and it was probably true. It was a mutual co-option I would say. But India, for
                    him, became an important center of the universe and he managed to divert huge
                    amounts of American resource to that country. For example, at one point, we had
                    a rupee account amounting to a couple of billion dollars stashed in the coffers
                    of the Indian Central Bank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are still living off them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Yes. Senator Moynihan, while he was Ambassador, finally had the good sense
                    to negotiate a framework of agreements that led to this huge rupee debt owed to
                    the US to be channeled into productive things that finally got rid of the bulk
                    of it. But we were an enormously important player in India in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is the saying that when the Democratic Party is in,
                        India gets the tip, and when the Republicans are in, it seems to go to
                        Pakistan. Did you have any feeling towards this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>VIETS: No, I think that is not a particularly thoughtful comment. There are many
                    factors at play here. I think that various administrations, going back to the
                    Nehru era and perhaps up to and including the present...although I am less
                    certain of myself now because I keep an eye only occasionally on US-Indian
                    relations, I am not intimately involved with it anymore...but I think that every
                    administration had its frustrations in dealing with the Indians, who are, as I
                    said earlier, inordinately frustrating human beings.</p>
                <p>The Pakistanis, on the other hand, have a somewhat crisper approach to their
                    relationship with the US. They know what they want and they are prepared to make
                    the necessary accommodations to get it. In consequence, over years I think that
                    the Pakistanis have done rather better in managing their relationships with the
                    United States than the Indians have. But it is a hell of a complicated subject
                    to open up on.</p>
                <p>While I was in India, of course, we had two Indo-Pak wars. One in 1969 and one in
                    1971. During the second one there was a major American bias toward support of
                    the Pakistanis. Henry Kissinger was, more than any other person, responsible for
                    this. I can recall Kissinger, who at that time was National Security Adviser for
                    Nixon, coming out to India. I was the control officer for his visit. At that
                    time I was working in the Ambassador's office. I had stayed on in India because
                    when Bowles left and a new Ambassador had arrived, Senator Kenneth B. Keating,
                    he had pinned my arms behind my back and knocked me against the wall and said
                    that I was going to stay and be his principal assistant. I agreed to do it for a
                    year and ended up doing it for three. That is why I was in India for so
                    long.</p>
                <p>In the summer of 1971 Kissinger visited India on his way to China, via Pakistan.
                    This was the famous secret first trip to China. As I said, I was appointed his
                    control officer for the visit. We had come up with the idea that he meet with a
                    group of Indians who had been his students at Harvard, in his celebrated Harvard
                    seminar. So we pulled in 20, 25 Indians from around the country who had studied
                    under him. We were very frustrated at that point because we had been sending
                    message after message to Washington saying that the Indians and Pakistanis were
                    on the way to war and Washington wasn't listening and didn't believe us. The
                    Washington policy mandarins thought we were reflecting Indian attitudes and not
                    our own best estimates.</p>
                <p>In any case I remember vividly getting these guys for breakfast around a huge
                    table in the Ashoka Hotel, and Kissinger showed up and remembered most of them.
                    He sat down and went around the room in his professorial fashion asking each of
                    them to make a forecast of what was going to happen in the next four months.
                    Every single one of them came up with a four or five minute analysis of why war
                    was inevitable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The war was over what issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>VIETS: The war resulted in the fragmentation of East Pakistan into the new nation
                    of Bangladesh. Its causes are complicated and some are still murky, but in sum
                    the Indians were dabbling around in East Pakistani politics and the Pakistanis
                    were dabbling around in Punjab things. A long story.</p>
                <p>In any case I was sitting beside Kissinger and could palpably feel his anger
                    rising because he didn't want to hear any of this. When we finally completed the
                    circle he just preemptively stood up and said in so many words that he was
                    ashamed that he had made so little impact in their capacity to analyze
                    situations rationally and none of them knew what he was talking about. There
                    wasn't going to be any war, and if there was, it was all India's fault, etc.</p>
                <p>It was quite a performance by this man and he stalked out leaving these poor
                    fellows all looking at one another and wondering...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In interviews in general what I have absorbed is that
                        Kissinger tends to make up his mind, and also there was a bigger plan as far
                        as he was concerned. He was in Pakistan and this was going to screw things
                        up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: That is right. We, of course, were not aware of his maneuverings at that
                    point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When he came was he asking you and others what was going
                        to happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Oh, sure. But as I said, there was hardly a day that a very thoughtful
                    cable didn't go out of our mission forecasting what was going to happen. It
                    didn't fit in with his scheme of things. I must say that I doubt very much if
                    Henry Kissinger spent a hell of a lot of time learning the intricacies of South
                    Asian politics. He did not have any particular love for the Indians to begin
                    with. He had had various encounters with them and apparently felt they were a
                    hopeless species.</p>
                <p>In this type of interview I don't want to get too deeply into analyzing Mr
                    Kissinger. I subsequently worked for him as the head of the so-called S/S-S,
                    Executive Secretariat, in the Department when he came over from the White House
                    to be Secretary of State. I spent a year there, so I had a ring side seat
                    observing how he worked and operated. He certainly was one of the most
                    fascinating figures in post-war American political history. He is a person of
                    exceptional talent and knowledge, but also a man who was not nearly as wise, I
                    think this is the word I want to use, as he managed to make the world believe.
                    US policy, as a consequence, enjoyed both the benefits and the downside of that
                    man's power.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As the war clouds gathered how did you see the other side
                        of the moon...our Embassy in Islamabad, and how were they reporting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, both Embassies made major efforts to keep our lines open without
                    necessarily including Washington. We visited one another very frequently. We
                    worked out some elements of our disagreements without spilling any blood on the
                    floor. But there remained some basic policy differences which led to opposing
                    policy analyses and recommendations from the two missions. I am not sure, as I
                    look back on it...and I would need to refresh my memory by going back and
                    reading some of the telegrams of the period from both missions...but I am not
                    sure how good a job either of us really did in seeing these issues through the
                    optic of our own national interests as opposed to perhaps doing a splendid job
                    of articulating the views of the governments to which we were accredited. I
                    would like to think that we did a reasonable job in interpreting these events
                    and analyzing them and recommending courses of actions that served American
                    interests. But we will leave that judgement to the diplomatic historians!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there also some emotion as to how the West
                        Pakistanis were putting down their colleagues in what we now call
                        Bangladesh?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Yes, there was a lot of butchery going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Including reports from our Consul General, Archer Blood
                        and others. This was a pretty emotional thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Indeed it was. Since we were bankers to both parties, we had some
                    responsibility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here was a Senator, Kenneth Keating, coming who was not a
                        great intellect as others had been and didn't come from having a significant
                        role in foreign policy formulation in the Senate. In fact, if I recall, he
                        was a defeated senator, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Yes, by Bobby Kennedy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was his first ambassadorial assignment. How was he
                        received and how did he operate and what was his role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>VIETS: To begin with, his appointment flowed from the fact that he and Richard
                    Nixon had entered the House of Representatives together and were founding
                    members of the Marching and Chowder Society and were very close friends.
                    Keating, by the time he got to India, had clearly begun to have some major
                    reservations about aspects of President Nixon's behavior, etc. However, he still
                    remained a loyal and close friend. That was the genesis of his appointment.</p>
                <p>The Indians, I think, were ambivalent about the appointment. In the first
                    instance they always wanted to think they were getting an ambassador, as most
                    countries do, who could pick up the phone and get the President on the other
                    end. Keating certainly could do this, although he wisely, because of his
                    political background, was aware of the fact that if you excessively used this
                    entree those who guard the portals of power will insure your access over time is
                    eroded, especially when you are 7 or 8 thousand miles away.</p>
                <p>The quality of persons with whom he was dealing with, for example, the top
                    echelon of the Foreign Ministry were all Oxford, Cambridge educated men, very
                    intelligent, worldly, suave, urbane, sophisticated, experienced men in the world
                    of politics and economics and it didn't take them very long to figure out that
                    Keating was not an intellectual heavyweight. But he had some damn strong people
                    standing behind him. So he was made to look much better, I think, than he
                    was.</p>
                <p>He was an enormously personable fellow, an Irish politician who really knew how
                    to press the flesh very well. He loved the social side of his job.</p>
                <p>He used his Senate method of operation by appointing a chief of staff who was
                    responsible for everything. I had both the great fortune and the misfortune of
                    being anointed by him to this position. Keating refused for a long, long time to
                    adhere to the traditional patterns of managing an embassy, and I as a fairly
                    young and junior officer found myself effectively running the place. The good
                    Ambassador used to devote a couple of hours in the morning to the office, then
                    retire to his swimming pool until late afternoon, followed by a siesta for a
                    couple of hours. He would then start his social rounds, the high point of his
                    day. I am afraid he did not work very hard, which meant that the rest of us put
                    in some mighty long hours. Fortunately, after several months of 20 hour days a
                    very professional DCM, Galen Stone, arrived in New Delhi and picked up the reins
                    as the traditional deputy Ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he have any opinions of how things were going? Did he
                        listen to others?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>VIETS: He would listen very carefully. I am hearing my voice echo here and
                    realize I am perhaps drawing a picture of something of a fool. He was not by any
                    stretch of the imagination. He was shrewd. He had a lot of experience in the
                    political world and in Washington. He had an enormous range of contacts in this
                    country. In every part of our society Ken Keating knew people who counted. He
                    was perfectly happy to use those contacts whenever they could be helpful.</p>
                <p>To his credit he recognized that, as politicians who survive do, I think, he had
                    some bright people working for him and he listened to them and took their
                    advice. I respect him for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he feel about this coming war? This is one of
                        those times when there was a lot of emotion at home over India and
                        Bangladesh.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: He had no trouble understanding what was coming down the pike and
                    supported fully those officers on his staff who were writing the telegrams that
                    made these forecasts and policy recommendations. He backed them to the hilt and
                    was back in Washington very frequently to argue the case in his own fashion. But
                    I fear that he was written down by the policy level people in Washington as
                    being a little fey and growing old and a bit forgetful. People in this city were
                    concerned because they knew he was a close friend of the President and thus he
                    was accorded respect due to his position and his age, but I don't think he made
                    any great impact in a personal sense either here or in India.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at policy situations, here you have a nice test
                        case. You have two countries with which we have considerable interest
                        in—Pakistan and India—and they are heading towards war. What can we do and
                        all that. We have a National Security Adviser who has his eyes fixed on
                        China and almost anything else is passed over. It is often said that you
                        don't really need a powerful ambassador because other things happen, but
                        really in the Washington sense, had this been somebody else who had not only
                        political clout but who was at the peak of his or her powers, that could
                        have made some difference.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>VIETS: Well, I agree with you. As you were posing this I was quickly thinking of
                    people I had worked with who could have made more of a difference. Sam Lewis,
                    for example. I was his DCM in Tel Aviv for a couple of years. There is a man who
                    had intellect, energy and the forcefulness of personality and the respect of his
                    audience in Washington at the policy level who would have made a difference had
                    he been in India. I am certain of it. I could name other people. You are right.
                    I do not subscribe to the prevailing theory that ambassadors are an anachronism
                    and are the personification of the irrelevancy of the Foreign Service
                    institution as it has developed. I agree that ambassadors are in some respects a
                    useless institution, but there are certain moments when they really earn their
                    keep and can make an enormous difference in the formation of policy and perhaps
                    even more importantly to the implementation and conduct of that policy. But they
                    have to have that combination of intellect and experience and the capacity to
                    come back to this city and make people listen to them. Otherwise the bureaucracy
                    in this city is so huge and so divisive and fractionated and self-important and
                    arrogant that it will just get its own way. I have always thought that this was
                    a capital waiting to be told what to do. Ambassadors, like certain generals and
                    admirals, still have that potential to represent the difference between
                    stupidity in policy and policy that is acute and germane to US national
                    interests. Unfortunately, I am not sure there are too many people about these
                    days who meet my criteria for this, but the potential role is there for the
                    person with the right mix of qualifications.</p>

                        Washington as far as clout goes than to have lost an election.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, you get what you deserve. I think the myopia of the political wisdom
                    of using defeated political candidates as an Ambassadorial resource was even
                    more sharply drawn when Keating decided that he wanted to go to Israel. He had
                    wanted to come out to India because he had served there as an officer in World
                    War II and had enjoyed it very much. He knew it could be a great life and indeed
                    for him it was. He had a huge staff in his residence, a beautiful residence and
                    a couple of swimming pools, airplanes at his disposal, etc. After 3 years he
                    decided he wanted to go to Israel, primarily I think because of the warm and
                    fuzzy feelings he had generated with his New York Jewish constituency. He
                    mistakenly calculated this popularity could be transferred and re-packaged in
                    Israel. Alas for him, it couldn't be, and he died an unhappy and frustrated
                    man.</p>

                <p>VIETS: That is right, and he enjoyed it. But as I say he decided that he wanted
                    to go to Israel and the President thought that was fine. Well, that killed him,
                    quite literally. If you can think of any more stupid thing to do then send a man
                    in failing health, elderly, unable to muster much energy and toss him into the
                    vortex of the Middle East and make sure he is there during a major war, that is
                    pretty smart.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Embassy react, particularly thinking of the
                        political officers? This was the time we were going through the tilt towards
                        Pakistan. Was there sort of a revolt of allegiance on the line or something
                        of this nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: No, no, no. If you are asking about the Indo-Pak war, our energies over
                    night refocused into trying to end the war. It was essentially US good offices
                    that brought that conflict to a relatively rapid end. It is a shining hour in
                    American diplomacy and I hope you don't ask me for too many details about how we
                    did it because my memory is fading!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe what you and others were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: To begin with, we were the main communications link between Islamabad;
                    Dacca, the provincial capital of East Pakistan and now the capital of
                    Bangladesh; and New Delhi. We got right into the middle of it by trying to
                    quickly defuse the situation. We arranged cease-fires, we were even the
                    communicators of “don't bomb during this period because red cross people are
                    going to be moving in and evacuating patients from hospitals,” etc. We did
                    everything you could dream of that a negotiator could do who had the best
                    communication system of anybody in the world at that point...not what it is
                    today, but still so much better than either one of the adversaries had.</p>
                <p>I think we were essentially trusted by both sides. Better said, I think the
                    people on the scene were trusted. I don't think Washington was particularly
                    trusted by either capital, but the force of personality of the people we had in
                    New Delhi and Islamabad and our bona fides had been amply demonstrated to our
                    respective host governments. And personal trust as always, even in issues of
                    war, become terribly, terribly important.</p>

                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>VIETS: No. There may have been some rumblings and threats, but I don't recall any
                    major Soviet role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you found dealing with the Indians that they didn't
                        feel we were on the side of the Pakistanis because of this? How did our role
                        in ceasing the hostilities play out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: As in all wars, there comes a point when the advice of the military to
                    their civilian political masters becomes the dominant element in decision
                    making. Our Deputy Chief of Mission in New Delhi, Galen Stone, had established
                    exceptional rapport with the military chiefs in India during that period. Also
                    our CIA liaison with the Indians was of the highest order at that point. The
                    combination of these two factors, I think played a critical role in ending the
                    war. Galen could sit down with the military chiefs individually and go through
                    things. Our Station chief could do that with his intelligence opposite numbers
                    at the top and they in turn could go to their political masters. They wanted to
                    end the war. They had no ambitions to become occupiers of East Pakistan. They
                    were taking casualties and were concerned about a potential long term guerilla
                    activity that could go on along the frontier. No soldier wants to continue a
                    war. It is the politicians who were the...</p>

                <p>Today is July 6, 1990 and this is a second interview with Ambassador Richard N.
                    Viets. Picking up where we left off before, I wonder if you could tell me your
                    impression at the time of how we treated India as regards to Vietnam? You were
                    there at the time and India was sort of the burr under everybody's saddle, at
                    least from our point of view. How did we look at it and how did we deal with
                    this?</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>VIETS: We swallowed hard. I think that both the Washington foreign policy
                    bureaucracy, as well as certainly our Embassy in New Delhi, accepted the fact
                    that we could not in any foreseeable conditions modify Indian views regarding
                    our role in Vietnam. But as in all conditions of this sort, there are always
                    anomalies and aberrations. One that immediately comes to mind is the fact that
                    the Indians made available to us, certainly during the seven years I was there
                    and I left in 1972, facilities at their naval bases in Cochin and Bombay, for
                    flotillas of US warships that had been on patrol off Vietnam and were on their
                    way back to Europe or the US and they would put into Cochin or Bombay for
                    several days of R&amp;R, refueling, etc. We made no effort to hide the fact that
                    these ships were coming from combat patrols in Vietnamese waters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume there was a general feeling of “let's cool it” as
                        far as talking about this anywhere. If you were faced with criticism about
                        doing more with India this was not something one would drag up to show
                        Indian support in Congress or the press.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Your point is well taken. The Indians were of some value to us in the ICC
                    operation in Vientiane and certainly there were individual Indian diplomats who
                    I think understood with greater clarity than perhaps their political masters
                    did, what was going on and quietly were helpful to us. But over all, as I said a
                    minute ago, I think we just gritted our teeth and muddled on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way this gives a certain feeling that there was some
                        sophistication in what we were doing because there is the tendency, either
                        the new people coming in or because of Congressional pressure, to go
                        charging around and try to do what you can't do. But you felt things were
                        well enough under control so that you didn't have to deal with people who
                        wanted to convert the heathen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I think it was, to borrow the cliche, more of a damage control operation.
                    What we were spending more time doing was insuring that the Indians didn't
                    publicly take us on in various arenas around the world on Vietnam, as opposed to
                    trying to proselytize and swing them around to our point of view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to ask a couple of questions. You mentioned
                        that you had this position where you were moved up and at your rank dealing
                        at a much higher level. One of the things I am interested in is how the
                        Foreign Service operates. How did this sit with your fellow officers at the
                        Embassy over a period of time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: That is always a question better put to others, not the individual.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: It wasn't easy for anyone. I think in the circumstances, people in that
                    mission...and as mentioned earlier it was a huge operation. My recollection is
                    that there was something like 800 Americans throughout the whole country at that
                    point. Certainly one of the biggest missions we had anywhere in the world. Many
                    of those people, of course, were AID folks out in the countryside, but still the
                    Embassy, itself, was enormous with 20 odd agencies represented there.</p>
                <p>People, I think, in general...those who showed up for work every day...understood
                    pretty well that what we were dealing with was (a) an ambassador who had no
                    background at all for the task that confronted him, (b) was beginning to show
                    signs of failing health and certainly did not have a great deal of energy and
                    (c) like many political appointees was rather more interested in the ceremonial
                    aspects of the job and the perquisites then he was in most of the substance. I
                    don't want to completely diminish Ambassador Keating. He had, I think, the good
                    sense, which I can't say for every political ambassador, to listen very
                    carefully to sound advice that was given to him by his professional
                    subordinates. Rarely would he override them. And he was prepared to stick his
                    neck out on policy issues when one could have easily seen it would be better for
                    him to remain quiet. In any case, people understood I think quite well the
                    nature of his role and personality and knew that somebody had to be there to
                    borrow Donald Regan's famous phrase, “to sweep up after him.” Certainly that was
                    one of my jobs.</p>
                <p>He also had made very clear from his day of arrival that he wanted to run that
                    mission as he had run his Senate office. He wanted to work through one person
                    and what happened after that didn't bother him much as long as it was done. It
                    was only after being there quite a few months that he became more sensitive to
                    the fact that one person really had to be the DCM, and not this young personal
                    assistant staff aide. But still behind closed doors more often than not he would
                    use me as his transmission belt to the DCM on many, many issues.</p>
                <p>I was very fortunate to be working with Galen Stone, under whom I had served a
                    couple of years earlier in New Delhi when he had been political counselor and I
                    was one of the political officers on his staff. We had developed a very close
                    personal relationship in addition to a professional relationship. When Keating
                    began to look for a new DCM, he was the person who I pushed hardest with
                    Keating. Ultimately Keating hired him. So here were two men who both had some
                    professional standards and who were also close personal friends. I think by in
                    large it worked very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It works sometimes when this sort of situation happens
                        when a political appointee brings his own staff aide from outside. Then
                        there is an immediate cutoff from the professional ranks.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>VIETS: Well there I have to give Keating great credit. He could have done the
                    same thing. He didn't. He knew he would be better served to use people within
                    the system. And I think he was. His successor arrived with an outside fellow who
                    took over the job I was doing and I think it was very, very hard for everybody
                    for a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you came back to Washington in 1972 and would
                        stay there until 1974. Having had this peculiar position in New Delhi, were
                        you told that you now would be doing work equivalent to your rank?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I came back and was assigned as one of the senior watch officers in the
                    Operations Center. Not a job without responsibility. We often said that when the
                    lights went out on the seventh floor and people went home, we effectively were
                    the link between the outside world and the Secretary of the State. And, indeed,
                    on occasion we dealt directly with the Secretary of State and certainly all the
                    other principals every day of the week when you were on duty.</p>
                <p>Ted Eliot at that time was the Executive Secretary and after perhaps three or
                    four months, I don't recall the precise period of time, Eliot called me in and
                    said that the officer, Nicholas Platt, who is now our Ambassador in the
                    Philippines and then was the head of the S/S-S, the line, the Executive
                    Secretariat, was moving over to the National Security Council, and Eliot asked
                    me to take over his job.</p>
                <p>This gave me more of the type of responsibility that I had in India. I must say
                    on looking back it was certainly one of the more interesting periods in my
                    Foreign Service career because in that job you are dealing 24 hours a day, seven
                    days a week, with the principals of the Department of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did your job entail?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well in those days, and I don't know how much it has changed in the
                    interim, there were about 10 or 12 young officers in their early 30s who had a
                    couple of tours under their belt, who were by all odds the cream of the crop.
                    Ray Seitz, for example, was one of the officers on my staff and is now Assistant
                    Secretary for Europe. Bob Blackwill was one of the young officers and now is the
                    President's senior adviser in European affairs. And I could just go through the
                    list, they were all...Jerry Bremer, who is now President of Kissinger
                    Associates...very talented fellows.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Each one was assigned several accounts...bureaus and offices in the
                    Department...to act as sort of interface between the seventh floor principals
                    and those particular offices. Every scrap of paper that the Department produced
                    for any of the seventh floor principals went through them. They sent it forward
                    with appropriate comment and if it didn't meet the standards it went back down.
                    Thus a lot of responsibility and a lot of power.</p>
                <p>In my time we actually, I think, stretched our charter somewhat by getting quite
                    frequently into policy aspects of what was being proposed. That was as much a
                    function of the acute intelligence of these officers as it was management on my
                    part.</p>
                <p>It was also a very interesting period because about two or three months after I
                    took over that job Secretary Rogers departed and a man named Henry Kissinger
                    came over. We had the great experience of breaking him in, as it were.</p>
                <p>There was a lot of travel involved. The Secretariat teams went everywhere with
                    the Secretary and usually the Deputy Secretary and sometimes even some of the
                    other principals, so one was in the air a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kissinger had been running foreign policy pretty much from
                        the National Security Council. When he came over to the State Department,
                        all of a sudden he had this apparatus. Did you find he was using it, or was
                        he more or less continuing as he had run the NSC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: He started out with a very small group of trusted staff that he brought
                    with him from the White House operation. But within a fairly short period of
                    time he had sized up with considerable acuity the strengths and weaknesses of
                    the State Department and the people that he could depend on. By the time he
                    left, I think the Foreign Service had gone a considerable distance towards
                    co-opting him, in the more positive sense of the word.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Selling itself as an instrument that could be used as
                        opposed to one that was dragging its heels.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Right. And it was a period in which there was a lot of talent around. He
                    knew how to use talent. He knew that talent would make him look good, and that
                    was part of the name of his game. So I have to give him in that arena very high
                    marks.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today there is talk that Baker is running for the
                        Presidency and people may be doing things to make him look good. Were you in
                        the Executive Secretariat ever pulling punches or trying to maneuver things
                        so that you wouldn't pull the Secretary into doing something...maybe
                        publicly making a hard decision or something, because often the Secretary of
                        State is the person who just by his job brings bad news?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I think one of the things that has happened to the institution of the
                    seventh floor is that over the years there is an increasing sense that the
                    domestic politics of foreign policy at the level of the Secretary of State are
                    sometimes more important than foreign policy implications.</p>
                <p>I remember actually just a couple of months ago having lunch with Paul Nitze and
                    talking about this subject. Nitze was reminiscing when he had been asked by
                    Acheson to revive a small policy planning cell. Acheson had sat him down in his
                    office to have their first discussion and the first thing Acheson had said was,
                    “I want to make one thing very clear, I want the best possible shot you can give
                    me on any particular foreign policy issue that I have to deal with. I don't want
                    you for one instant to crank into your best shot the domestic political
                    implications of whatever it is you are advising me to do. That is my concern and
                    the President's concern. The two of us will worry about that. Your job is to
                    tell me what is best for this country, exclusively in foreign policy terms.”
                    Well, anybody who took that attitude today would be out on the street within two
                    hours. I saw this so strongly in the latter years of my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about at this time? Was this a consideration? You say
                        you were a filter and a filter always plays an important role in any
                        bureaucracy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I am not sure I can give you an accurate answer to that question without
                    sitting down in a dark corner and pouring over some recollections. I know that
                    domestic political considerations, especially as the Nixon era came to a close,
                    were certainly there, but I am contrasting my recollections of that period with
                    what I saw over the last five or ten years in the Foreign Service and they were
                    nothing in comparison to today. When I say today, I am not specifically talking
                    about James Baker whom I never served under, but his predecessor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One other thing before we leave this. You say that
                        sometimes these young officers were getting involved in policy matters. Can
                        you give some examples?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>VIETS: If papers were done by bureaus, for example, on disarmament negotiations
                    and came up and were not well argued or the options that were offered were, for
                    the most part, straw options, not realistic, one of these young guys would come
                    in and we would sit down and go through it and discuss it and decide whether we
                    would shoot it back down to the front office of that bureau. That often
                    precipitated an angry Assistant Secretary calling me and telling me to keep my
                    nose out of his business. I would respond that I was saving him from himself, it
                    was a lousy paper and he should take a more careful look at it and here were
                    some ways to strengthen it. It was a great way to make both friends and
                    enemies!</p>
                <p>To be more precise, we were not actually sitting down and designing policy.
                    Rather, we were attempting to improve the quality of the arguments, proposals,
                    etc. that were going to the Secretary. Sometimes this required totally redoing
                    things and at other times perhaps simply dropping stuff and adding new
                    stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were in this position I assume you were keeping

                </p>
                <p>VIETS: There was really no time. It was a very, very stressful job. I actually
                    worked at it six and a half to seven days a week because it never stopped.
                    People burned out quite fast. There was always a lot of last minute juggling.
                    There were very long hours...16, 17, 20 hour days sometimes. And, as I said, an
                    awful lot of traveling, which consumes people as you well remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So I take it in this period of time you didn't really have
                        much time to contemplate policy direction and all this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I contemplated, if that is the action word...there was only time for a lot
                    of fast thinking about things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly towards the latter period of Kissinger as
                        Secretary of State and the Watergate thing began to build up, did you have
                        the feeling that the direction at the top was not as strong as it might have
                        been?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I think our overwhelming sense was that our allies were deeply concerned
                    about the staying power of the administration, its capacity to make timely
                    decisions. Kissinger, obviously, was aware of this fact and worked very hard to
                    counterbalance it. But he had so many other liabilities in a personal sense,
                    that I am not sure how successful he was in doing this. Remember, I left that
                    job after only a year because I had been selected as Deputy Chief of Mission in
                    Romania and was sent off to study Romanian for four months. So I only had a
                    year's exposure to this.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VIETS: In 1974.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: At the conclusion of the four month course I went immediately to
                    Bucharest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Bucharest? You were there from
                        1974-77. This is midstream Ceausescu.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: We had in place a most remarkable Ambassador, Harry Barnes, who had some
                    three years earlier himself been the Deputy Chief of Mission there. He had come
                    back to the Department for a couple of years and then had been nominated as our
                    Ambassador and not long after he got there, I arrived. Harry knew the country as
                    well or better than perhaps any American diplomat who ever served there. He was
                    essentially bilingual in Romanian. A fantastic linguistic competence.</p>
                <p>Even though Romania was a very carefully controlled...I started to stay a closed
                    society, but they hadn't totally slammed the door at that point...it was still
                    possible with a lot of work and care to develop relationships with private
                    Romanian citizens. And Harry succeeded in that better than anybody on his staff,
                    or perhaps all the rest of his staff put together. He felt that Ceausescu was
                    still redeemable in certain areas in the sense that if we were clever enough and
                    worked hard enough at it we could maneuver Ceausescu into doing certain things
                    that were in both Romania's interest, which was an element in Harry's approach
                    to his job, as well as in US interests. His major effort was to weave as many
                    strands of ties, economic, cultural, political, with the United States as he
                    could.</p>
                <p>We initiated all kinds of programs. We had an extremely active cultural exchange
                    program...student exchange, professors, researchers, etc. We negotiated an MFN
                    agreement with the Romanians. We negotiated a trade agreement with the
                    Romanians. We worked terribly hard at family reunification cases. We did vastly
                    more than the Israeli Embassy and the Israeli government to insure that Romanian
                    Jews were permitted to leave Romania.</p>
                <p>It was again a kind of a whirling dervish type of job working for Harry who had
                    inexhaustible energies and a very fertile mind. He had all kinds of new ideas
                    every morning. He would come in and reel them off.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Romania was really sort of the star in the Eastern
                        European firmament as far as our foreign policy was concerned. It served in
                        the way that in the fifties Yugoslavia served. This was sort of a friend in
                        the other camp.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I think one can overdo this. We were under no illusions that the Ceausescu
                    regime in internal affairs was the most oppressive in Eastern Europe even in the
                    mid-seventies when I was there. But externally, of course, Ceausescu had managed
                    to carve out a fair amount of freedom to maneuver. It was in that arena that
                    Kissinger and his successors dealt most effectively. Harry Barnes concerns went
                    beyond the external side. He tried to loosen up some of the internal political
                    dynamics and up to a point succeeded, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this period, human rights was really not in the front
                        of our priority list in foreign affairs. That came later during the Carter
                        administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I am happy to have you ask that question because as you know I have
                    recently been back to Romania a couple of times in connection with the elections
                    and I have had the mitigated pleasure of having to sit in a number of
                    conversations with revisionist historians and others who were lecturing me about
                    “how could you possibly have permitted the United States government to deal with
                    this dreadful tyrant, Ceausescu? There were all these civil rights that were
                    being abused and you people never did anything about it. You just gave them MFN,
                    etc.”</p>
                <p>Well, I would take issue with you on one level. You are quite correct that under
                    Henry Kissinger, human rights would never be writ large in the foreign policy
                    charter of the United States government because that would get in the way of
                    doing things that he thought were perhaps more important. But by golly for those
                    of us who were there, human rights were terribly important. As I said a moment
                    ago, we spent hours and hours every week cajoling, arguing, prodding, pushing,
                    probing for ways to get (a) Romanians who were divided from their families out
                    of the country, and (b) making life easier for those who couldn't get
                    out...rapping knuckles when people were thrown in jail, etc. They were important
                    to us and we did a hell of a lot.</p>
                <p>The difference is that we didn't have a human rights bureaucracy in this country,
                    both in the non-governmental sector as well as in the bureaucracy itself. So
                    there wasn't a great deal of publicity generated by this. It was just very
                    quietly done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to add this as a historical note that your actions
                        were following events almost a hundred years before when President Grant had
                        sent an American Jew to Romania, Benjamin Behoto [ph], for strictly the
                        purpose for trying to help the Jewish community. This was done at the behest
                        of the Jewish-American community. He was paid actually from volunteer funds
                        from various Jewish groups including some from the Rothschild family.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way for somebody who is looking at the Foreign
                        Service and all or the State Department apparatus, an awful lot is done in
                        the field that is not part of an official telegram that goes out. If you see
                        something that can be done it depends really on the ambassador in a
                        way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Yes, you do it. There still are people in this profession who don't need
                    to seek credit for things that they do and therefore never reported it, or only
                    casually, informally would make reference to it. I think that is the difference
                    between the professional and whatever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Harry tell the Romanians that they had to let more
                        Jews go to Israel or other things that were not our immediate concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, this was the carrot and stick. I mentioned a moment ago, for
                    example, that we had negotiated an MFN treaty. We negotiated it in a fashion
                    that required frequent reviews of performance in various areas including the
                    numbers of family reunification, the numbers of Jews that were allowed out, etc.
                    The Romanians were terribly anxious to get an trade agreement with us. Once
                    again we tied to that understandings, some explicit, some implicit, but we knew
                    and they knew what we were expecting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with the Romanian government? Was
                        everything under Ceausescu?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: By the definition of the apparatus which he set up you could do nothing
                    without channeling it through him. By the same token, as with any other society
                    you worked very hard at developing relationships with people who could help make
                    things happen. You won their trust or made yourself needed by them and proceeded
                    a pace.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the British, French and Germans involved as much in
                        what we would call the human rights field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: No. The Germans were more than anybody else because of the large German
                    community...roughly 300,000-400,000 Germans up in the Transylvania area. These
                    people were trying to get to the Federal Republic as the Jews were trying to get
                    to Israel. So they more than any other embassy were involved in similar efforts.
                    But we were way out ahead of all other missions across the board in our interest
                    in the human rights arena.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>And I was saddened when I most recently was in Romania a month ago to discover
                    that when a group of lawyers I was with wanted to discuss the human rights
                    situation, everywhere we would turn we were told it was the Dutch Ambassador who
                    was the man who was the most active and knew the most people, etc., not the
                    American Embassy. So we went and had a session with the Dutch Ambassador and
                    sure enough he turned out to be vastly better informed than our own Embassy
                    did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is personality...who is there and who wants to take on
                        things. How did Harry Barnes use you as his deputy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, Harry started the relationship with the time honored assurances that
                    I was to be his alter ego and I think perhaps more than anybody I ever worked
                    with he stuck to that. There was nothing he did or nothing he knew that he
                    didn't share. He was very good at delegating the daily operation of the Embassy.
                    At the same time his shadow loomed over everything we did. He loved to travel
                    and spent a lot of time out of Bucharest and in the countryside so that also
                    left one ample opportunity to...and he was frequently in Washington pushing his
                    agenda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we find Bucharest a good “listening post” compared
                        with other places? It had strained relations with the Soviet Union and some
                        of the other Warsaw Pact countries.VIETS: I think the answer has to be yes.
                        It was a particularly useful listening post for the rest of Eastern Europe
                        and the third world because it was the anchorage for all kinds of
                        revolutionary groups and individuals who used Romania as their training
                        ground or safe harbor. There was a great deal going on in that country of
                        interest to us.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mention revolutionary groups, were these terrorist
                        organizations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, the PLO, for example, was very active there, as were other
                    Palestinian organizations. Various African liberation groups were also
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your brief at the Embassy as far as contact was
                        concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: You mean my personal brief?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, your brief and also the Embassy's.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>VIETS: Obviously we had to live within whatever rules of the road that were laid
                    down by the Department on dealing with groups such as the PLO, but if one was
                    seated next to someone at a dinner table who was “black-listed” you found ways
                    of being polite and also productive. But there were plenty of other people who
                    were able to deal with these people and those clearly would become contacts of
                    yours. You would carry on dialogues through them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about relations with other Eastern European
                        countries, particularly the bordering countries? Was there concern that an
                        awful lot was being swept under the rug by the tight controls...nationality
                        problems, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I think the sense was there that in the future there were going to be
                    immense problems because of the overlapping of nationalities. I think that none
                    of us had the foresight to predict that Eastern Europe would crumble as rapidly
                    as it did. There was no love lost between the Romanians and their fraternal
                    brothers in Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>I remember particularly the Yugoslavs were terribly disdainful of the Romanians
                    and they shared a long border and a lot of other common economic interests.
                    Ceausescu was detested by other Eastern European leaders. I think they were
                    embarrassed by his cult of personality, etc. So again another interesting way to
                    get insights into those people were through discussions of what was going on in
                    Romania.</p>
                <p>One of my most fruitful contacts was my Yugoslav counterpart who had been in
                    Romania for a number of years and was the best informed person in the country so
                    far as I was concerned of what was happening behind the scenes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling that there was another life behind the
                        Ceausescu facade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well there surely was another life and that was a Sybaritic life of
                    nothing but the best for Ceausescu and his family and immediate hangers-on. But
                    I am not sure what you mean by the question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you able to sample what the Army was thinking,
                        or the peasants were thinking, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>VIETS: We tried but everybody was so scared the instant you began to raise
                    subjects such as this. People would look at the ceiling or put their finger to
                    their lips or roll their eyes, etc. It was very tough to do, but we were
                    constantly traveling. As I said, the Ambassador spent an awful lot of his time
                    out of town, but the rest of us also traveled a great deal. It was the most
                    traveling Embassy I have ever served at, which was helpful. In consequence we
                    were far and away the best informed foreign mission in Romanian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I traveled a lot when I was in Yugoslavia. I added it up
                        once and discovered I had spent 42 nights in different places in Yugoslavia.
                        This was very typical of the Embassy. Before we leave Romania, were there
                        any major problems or situations that you experienced?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: We had a Presidential visit. Mr. Ford came to see us. Kissinger came a
                    couple of times. I think one of my most vivid memories in a very personal sense
                    of a job that I doubt very many Foreign Service officers have had to shoulder
                    was to take Ceausescu's most senior adviser aside at a music recital in the
                    Ambassador's residence and warn him against the imminent assassination of
                    somebody in the United States. I will always recall that particular evening and
                    the aftermath of that conversation. That is the sort of message that one doesn't
                    pass very often.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can I ask more about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, I probably shouldn't go beyond that, but it was a very dicey period.
                    I am happy to say that the individual who was the target, so far as I am aware,
                    is still thriving. The assassination team was called off at the last moment but
                    only after a lot of huffing and puffing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get the impression that the Romanians thought they
                        had a sort of special relation with the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Oh, very much so. And as is their cultural heritage, they pushed it to the
                    limit and beyond. I think that by the late seventies and early eighties as
                    Ceausescu's paranoia became more and more evident, that markedly changed. My
                    good friend Roger Kirk, who was our Ambassador in Bucharest until about ten
                    months ago, spent a very tough three years there. The relationship dribbled off
                    into open antagonism and he had a tough time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Bucharest in 1977 and went from there to another
                        hot spot, Tel Aviv, again as Deputy Chief of Mission. How did this
                        assignment come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>VIETS: That is an interesting story. I was back in Washington for a consultation
                    three or four months before I was scheduled to finish my three year assignment
                    and Carol Laise, who was then Director General, called me in for a meeting. She
                    announced to me that she was very unhappy with the situation in our Embassy in
                    India at that particular time and thought it needed a very different hand. I was
                    her handpicked person to go out as political counselor. Happy as I would have
                    been to return to India, I was not happy with the thought of returning as
                    political counselor having been for three years a DCM in Romania. I thought it
                    was a step backwards. Carol didn't see it that way. Her interest in India was
                    supreme and anyone who had an opportunity to serve in India, regardless of the
                    level, was obviously...</p>
                <p>I was a good soldier and said, “Okay. I would rather have another DCMship, but if
                    this is what you think must be done, I will do it.” I returned to the India desk
                    and there was a phone message for me from a man named Sam Lewis, who I had met
                    once or twice before socially, but had never worked with him. Sam had just been
                    nominated as our Ambassador to Tel Aviv. The phone message asked me if I would
                    have lunch with him that very day. I agreed and we had a terrible cafeteria
                    lunch.</p>
                <p>It became clear to me in the first 30 seconds of the conversation that Sam was
                    taking a look at me as a potential DCM. At the end of it I was pretty certain
                    that I was going to get the job, although he was shrewd enough not to say so.
                    Indeed, a couple of days later he called me and formally offered it. So we had
                    to go to Carol and untangle the India web.</p>
                <p>Sam was very anxious to have me there immediately after his arrival. He was being
                    held back in Washington until the day after the Israeli elections when Prime
                    Minister Begin was elected. He flew out the next day and two weeks later I
                    stepped on an airplane in Bucharest bound for Israel. Half an hour later I was
                    sitting at my desk hard at work and never stopped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's compare and contrast how Harry Barnes used you as
                        his DCM and Sam Lewis used you as DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, again, the same traditional ambassadorial words of, “I don't want
                    anything to go on here that you are not aware of, etc.” Sam was true to his
                    word. Especially in Israel you had to be because it was such a hot spot. This
                    was the period that led up to the Camp David negotiations and then the
                    Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty. The US was right in the middle of all of that
                    from day one, setting up everything and acting as intermediary for months and
                    months between the Egyptians and Israelis who wouldn't speak directly to each
                    other. We set up all kinds of secret contacts, etc. There were periods when more
                    than half the time Sam was in Washington. So one really became almost a
                    permanent Charg� and it was necessary that we worked very closely, and we
                    did.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>The only area that Sam reserved for himself, and he insisted that it was for
                    protection purposes for me, was relationships with the American-Jewish
                    organization leadership. He felt that that was the exclusive responsibility of
                    the Ambassador to manage that and very rarely did I get involved in it. It would
                    only be when I was Charg� and a group came in and I would have to meet with
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the period you were there...you were there from
                        1977-1979...how did you and the Embassy view the Israeli political
                        situation? Here was a real change in the political orientation domestically
                        in Israel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: There was very deep concern over the political changes that took place
                    under Begin. We spent an enormous amount of energy and time trying to modify
                    some of Begin's views and policies. A great deal of time during my first year
                    was spent in trying to effectively contain Israeli attacks into the Lebanon. You
                    had on the one hand, very, very active intelligence, Mossad, and Israeli Army
                    and Air Force operations in Lebanon, and at the same time you were carrying on
                    these very sensitive negotiations between the Israelis and the Egyptians, in
                    which we were the exclusive conveyor belt. All messages went through us...to
                    Cairo and came back from Cairo to us. We were the principal interlocutors for a
                    very long time.</p>
                <p>I remember after months of this finally one day getting a call from Prime
                    Minister Begin's Chef de Cabinet, asking me immediately to get on the line to
                    Cairo to pass along a message which he dictated to me over the phone. I said,
                    “For Christ's sake, Eli, why don't you pick up the phone and do it yourself.” A
                    week before a direct line had been established. He said, “Do you think they
                    would answer the phone?” I said, “Why don't you try.” He did and it worked. That
                    is how we began to get out of the business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how the Begin government
                        worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, that is about a week of conversation. Begin was a most remarkable
                    figure. An old world Polish Jew who had lost all of his family in the holocaust
                    under dreadful, dreadful circumstances. Truly a great patriot in his own right.
                    He was a lawyer to the tips of his toes, very legalistic in everything. A man
                    with enormous innate politeness. Even in the most dreadful moments of
                    antagonism, and disagreement, conversations would always have to start out with,
                    “How is your wife and your daughters?” etc. All the niceties of civilized
                    conduct were carried on and then once you got beyond that he was one tough
                    cookie to deal with.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>But there were other tough cookies who worked with him. Moshe Dayan was a
                    brilliant man. The most fertile, creative mind of any of Begin's advisers. Ezer
                    Weizman, who in those years was an unbridled hawk and has now become a great
                    dove. He was quite a remarkable figure. There were some very tough chiefs of
                    staff in the army that one had to deal with regularly. It is difficult to
                    characterize and describe the nature and quality of our Embassy relationship in
                    Israel during those days. Again, I think, it has changed substantially since
                    then. We were simply in all their pockets as they were here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have been interviewing Nicholas Veliotes who mentioned,
                        this was in the early seventies, that they always had to work on Friday
                        because the cabinet met. I asked why they had to schedule the Embassy
                        meeting because of a foreign government's cabinet? Well, apparently the
                        relationship is so close that one is moving in accordance with their
                        political life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: And you had this enormous community in Washington interested in everything
                    that was going on. You had a huge press corps there that was spewing tens of
                    thousands of words of reporting back here seven days a week. So you were in
                    competition all the time with even the wire services in getting stuff back. We
                    were just constantly, 24 hours a day running that relationship. It was, and
                    remains, deeply complicated by the fact that our Chancery is in Tel Aviv and
                    everything except the Ministry of Defense and Mossad Headquarters were in
                    Jerusalem. So you were everyday winding up and down those Judean hills to
                    Jerusalem to do your business and then dictating all the way back into a little
                    portable recorder your cables and memcons.</p>
                <p>As time went on and the negotiations leading up to Camp David became so critical,
                    we often would move over from meetings with the Prime Minister or other cabinet
                    ministers and dictate our reports at our consulate general in Jerusalem and send
                    them from there, simply because of time purposes, or we would get on the secure
                    phone in Jerusalem. There were days that one would make three round-trip trips
                    to Jerusalem. The last one perhaps getting home at 3 o'clock in the morning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were sort of an outsider to this. You had served in
                        India and Romania. Did you sometimes stand back and say, “Why the hell are
                        we getting so involved in this country and what really is our real interest
                        here?”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>VIETS: Well, I think that one of the reasons Sam took me as his DCM was that
                    conversation over lunch in the State Department cafeteria in which I expressed
                    considerable skepticism about the nature of the US-Israeli relationship, one
                    that I did not know a great deal about but what I did know I was skeptical about
                    it. I think that Sam may have felt that perhaps it was not a bad idea to have
                    somebody at his side with this quality. Indeed, to his great credit a few weeks
                    after I arrived, we brought out an extraordinarily talented older officer named
                    Bill Brubeck, who had served as DCM in Amman some years earlier. He had become
                    really a great authority on the Middle East and was an iconoclast of the first
                    order. We brought him out because we wanted somebody sitting off, out of the
                    line of daily operational fire, to nitpick, to push us, to examine and
                    re-examine from every perspective what we were up to.</p>
                <p>All of this in the light of what subsequently happened in the relationship may
                    sound like pretty thin gruel, but I, at least, to the day I left, liked to think
                    that I maintained my integrity in handling that relationship when things...I
                    would call a spade a spade. I still have some marvelous notes from Jimmy Carter
                    and Brzezinski and Cy Vance on things I did, especially when I was Charg� and
                    brought the Israelis up short.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There has been this accusation that you get in the Near
                        Eastern Bureau that I am sure everyone is aware of, that somehow our Embassy
                        in Israel becomes completely co-opted by the Jewish movement politically in
                        the United States. Here is a small country of several million people putting
                        us at odds with this huge Arab world out there and it is not in America's
                        interest. Somehow the feeling gets focused on the Embassy. When I mention
                        Sam Lewis to hands who have dealt in the Arab world steam begins to come out
                        of their ears. I wonder, is this endemic or is there a problem of
                        co-option?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I believe in general terms there are problems of co-option in almost any
                    society you can name for a diplomat operating in that environment if he gets
                    deeply involved in it. But I think there is nothing that approaches the danger
                    of co-option in Israel because here is a society that never lets up. It has
                    enormous influence and impact in Washington and has no qualms about using it.
                    For them the game is their security, their livelihood, their lives. That is
                    their argument. It is very tough to buck it. I think that it is a major mistake
                    to leave anybody in Israel for an extended period of time. And I include,
                    needless to say, ambassadors in that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In dealing with upper level Israelis...let's say a
                        directive comes out from Washington to press them hard on a point...they
                        look at you and say, “Okay fellows, this is nice and you have made your
                        point, but if you press it too hard we are going back to the Israeli lobby
                        in the United States and they are going to wipe you out.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>VIETS: I don't remember anybody being quite that blunt. They didn't have to be.
                    There is language within language in this arena. But I can assure you that we
                    all had our hours at bat when we were brutal in our directness. I certainly
                    include Sam in this. Whatever Sam's reputation is, and remember I was only there
                    for a little over two years with him, and he stayed on for seven or eight years,
                    and clearly as time went on his views were modified and shaped by the pressures
                    that were on him so I won't speak to that. But during the period I was there the
                    United States was very lucky to have a guy as smart and tough as he was. When
                    the chips were down there was never any question in my mind as to what he was
                    representing in those days. It perhaps changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were there at a time when there was really a
                        very crucial shift going on, when Israel was becoming more and more
                        dependent on the United States. Was there disquiet on the side of the
                        Israelis who were looking on this thing and knowing the underside of
                        American politics, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I think there were very few thoughtful Israelis who worried a great deal
                    about the liabilities of becoming so dependent on the United States. In part
                    because I think no one in those years understood how dependent Israel ultimately
                    was going to become. And secondly, because I think there is an inbred, perhaps
                    arrogance is too strong a term, but I will use it, that at the end of the day
                    they knew what they were doing and could manage the relationship in a fashion
                    that would always keep their interests protected.</p>
                <p>On the American side there certainly were many people who were concerned about
                    the changing nature of the relationship, but the domestic politics of the
                    relationship became so paramount in policy decisions with the Congress pressing
                    the administration unmercifully to give more and more aid, military assistance,
                    economic assistance, trade advantages, intelligence exchanges, etc. You had
                    people like Jimmy Carter who suddenly found himself running for his life. In his
                    re-election campaign he turned 180 degrees concerning his views on how to handle
                    the Israelis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But initially you were there when Carter was first coming
                        in. So the period you were there you felt that there was really a certain
                        amount of firm control?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>VIETS: No, I wouldn't say that. I think the moment of major change, the fault
                    line, took place during the Johnson administration. Up to that time, I think the
                    relationship had been one that was best characterized by the figure of
                    speech...the Israelis were kept on a quite short leash. Johnson, for purely
                    domestic political reasons, changed that policy. He suddenly opened up a
                    cornucopia of arms to Israel. We became the principal military suppliers and
                    remain so to this day. Economic assistance began markedly to increase under
                    Johnson. By the time Carter arrived in office it was already in the billions. I
                    can remember arguing until blue in the face on maintaining lower levels and
                    ultimately we found ourselves faced with a relationship that had gone out of
                    control in many important respects.</p>
                <p>But lets be fair, I am sitting here running on about a relationship that is so
                    complicated and so nuanced that one risks doing a great injustice to it with the
                    kinds of superficial responses that time constraints dictate in responding to
                    your questions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The idea is to at least pick up some of the feeling here.
                        What were your impression of our congressman coming to Israel? Was this sort
                        of a political situation that they would come to? Were they completely the
                        creatures of the Jewish lobby in the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I think with rare exception one would have to characterize them as being
                    craven in their deportment and behavior, each trying to out do the other in
                    their public utterances, in their fealty and loyalty to the State of Israel and
                    its people. They had very little time for any conversation that contained
                    criticism or analysis of what was going on. These were PR visits for use in
                    fund-raising and election winning. One very often was physically disgusted by
                    it.</p>
                <p>Let me add out of fairness to the Israelis, I think in the dark of the night they
                    were equally disgusted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it is almost impossible not to be by this peculiar
                        relationship that has developed. What about our consul general in Jerusalem?
                        This has always been a fascinating post. I have written a history of the
                        consular service and at one point the consul general in Jerusalem, in the
                        1970s up through World War I, served as a protectorate of the Jews. This was
                        unofficially, but interceded often with the Ottomans, etc. But then the role
                        almost switch. It was the same role but the Ottoman Empire no longer posed a
                        threat, the Israelis were the occupying power. How did you view their
                        operation, what were they doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I think Sam and I agreed that we would not fall into the trap that some of
                    our predecessors had in viewing the consulate general as the enemy. As you know
                    I think it remains the only consulate anywhere in the world whose reporting goes
                    directly to Washington.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Oh, yes. So both of us worked very hard in insuring that our personal
                    relationships with the Consul General and staff...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the Consul General?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, Mike Newlin was there for all of the period that I was there. Mike
                    felt the same way. I, in particular, spent a lot of time insuring that Mike was
                    kept fully apprized of all but a tiny fraction of sensitive elements of our
                    negotiations leading up to the Camp David and the peace treaty, etc. Although a
                    lot of the traffic was so highly compartmentalized we couldn't send it to
                    Jerusalem, he would come down one day a week and lock himself in my office and I
                    would show it to him. So he knew what was happening.</p>
                <p>For his part, he insured that all of his reporting was repeated to Tel Aviv. Our
                    staffs would meet regularly and compare notes. Occasionally there would be an
                    eruption of differences, but on the whole it was very well managed and
                    productively managed on both sides. The one major problem area I recall was at
                    the staff level. A vice consul became very, very incensed over her perception of
                    some human rights abuses on the part of the Israelis.</p>
                <p>

                        this. It got on the front pages...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: She documented a number of cases of maltreatment and abuse of Arab
                    prisoners in jails, etc. She was very concerned that the Embassy was
                    undercutting her and went public at one point on this. In the end, I think she
                    was relatively satisfied. She had her day in court and her information in no way
                    shape or form was censored.</p>

                        This is Jimmy Carter and human rights time. There is a very controversial

                        things coming out of the West Bank where Israeli occupation authorities were
                        that were embarrassing to the Israelis and which they didn't want

                <p>VIETS: They were reported. I am sad to observe that the censorship of these
                    reports took place in Washington, not in the field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a little about Washington. My only time in the
                        Middle East was a short time as a vice consul in Saudi Arabia. I had nothing
                        to do with any of this and am not a Middle East hand, but I have watched
                        this with a certain amount of fascinated disinterest. It has always seemed
                        that in Washington our relationship with Israel is so political that you
                        really can't report as you would from another post. It would immediately
                        leak into the press, one's career could be jeopardized, etc. How did you
                        feel about this? You were new to it too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: My career, I guess, is marked by a reputation of being excessively
                    outspoken and I never really worried about it. It seemed to me that one calls a
                    spade a spade as accurately as one can. That is on reporting. When it comes to
                    policy formulation, obviously one has to be careful to insure that you are
                    embracing the spectrum of agreement and disagreement. So it is two quite
                    different issues that one is talking about.</p>
                <p>I felt, as Sam did, that careers could be badly bruised, if not destroyed, out
                    there, so one made very sure that one took responsibility for those messages
                    that we knew would cause heartburn in Washington. But one encouraged the younger
                    officers on the staff to dig and dig hard and there was no...I think it would be
                    an interesting case study to go around to officers in that mission who have left
                    and ask them if they felt any kind of constraints being put on them. I doubt
                    very much during that period you would find...My concern today, if we can move
                    this interview to 1990...by virtue of one of the things I am doing in retirement
                    is political advisor to King Hussein, so I stayed very actively engaged in
                    US-Israeli relationships and US-Arab relationships, such as they are. I am
                    deeply concerned that almost all of the Foreign Service officers that I now see
                    and deal with, I feel have become politicized by this issue and all too often
                    are pulling their punches in their reporting, their analysis, their
                    recommendations to their superiors. It is something that I could quite easily
                    document. It is very sad to see what is happening. They are scared of their
                    careers on this particular issue.</p>

                        would do this; or was it somebody who was wanting to make a name for

                <p>VIETS: There would be a lot of discussion over telephones, I don't recall cables

                <p>VIETS: Point well taken. More than in any post I had served in you were aware of
                    the fact that what you were sending back in one form or another, bits and pieces
                    of it could appear in the public domain. We had some very special category
                    arrangements on distribution for that stuff so few people saw that and I don't
                    recall any difficulties there. But once you got below that, it was fair game to

                    aware than many that it was important to keep a historical record. Files were
                    full of memcons, telephone memcons, etc. But in the pace of events you just

                </p>
                <p>Today is October 21, 1992 and this continues an interview with Ambassador Richard
                    N. Viets. Dick, the last time we covered a lot of the relationships between the
                    Embassy and Washington. What was your view and the Embassy's view of the Arabs
                    within Israel itself at that time?</p>
                <p>VIETS: I must say in retrospect I am not at all certain that this Embassy nor I
                    as the Deputy Chief of Mission put as much focus on the issues of the Arabs
                    within the so-called green line, Israel proper, as we should have. I believe in
                    an earlier interview, we may have got into the tensions that existed between the
                    Embassy and our Consul General in Jerusalem, which, of course, is responsible
                    directly to Washington for reporting what was going on in the occupied
                    territories. The Arabs within the green line were by definition the
                    responsibility of the Embassy.</p>
                <p>During that period, as a community, my recollection is that they were a quiescent
                    lot. I don't recall, frankly, with enough vivid detail, what at the time I felt
                    was the reason for this quiescence. Whether it was that they simply had been
                    beaten down by the general weight of the Israeli state, or whether they had
                    simply made their peace with themselves and with the Israelis and were going
                    about their lives. There was very little, as I recall, formal contact between
                    the two Arab Palestinian communities...those within the green line with those in
                    the occupied territories. This wasn't terribly easy to accomplish because of the
                    security apparatus and the military apparatus which was omnipresent. I think any
                    green line Arab seen spending a lot of time on the West Bank would immediately
                    have come to the attention of the Israeli authorities and probably would have to
                    shortly respond to somebody to what he was doing there. So it was not a period
                    when a great deal of contact was taking place.</p>
                <p>We had in the Embassy a political officer who, along with a number of other
                    things, added it to his portfolio and did sporadic reporting on it. We certainly
                    kept in touch with the Arab delegation in the Knesset and members of the
                    parliament. But I don't know in retrospect whether perhaps we should have put
                    more emphasis on that community than we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like at the time they knew their place and the
                        Israeli apparatus was keeping them knowing their place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: That is certainly my recollection.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Coming to the events...you were there probably at the most
                        dramatic time one can imagine, other then just a war going on which is
                        dramatic, but not necessarily moving ahead. What was our view of Sadat
                        before he came? Were you getting from Egypt a feeling that something was
                        happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Yes, quite a lot. To begin with, we knew, although it took us some weeks
                    to extract the full facts out of the Israelis, we knew that there had been
                    contact between Dayan, the then Foreign Minister, and an Egyptian in the
                    President's office. I recall vividly Dayan's anecdote about this gentleman, who
                    he had met on one or more occasions secretly in Morocco. I recall Dayan telling
                    the story that at one of their meetings this man suddenly went very silent and
                    wouldn't respond or anything. When his silence was finally broken he announced
                    that he was very fond of clocks, he collected clocks and he apparently at that
                    moment heard a lot of clocks ringing in his brain and he had to listen to them
                    and he couldn't talk to anybody. There was some very strong feeling on Dayan's
                    part and I think on others who knew this gentleman, that he was slightly
                    “tetched.”</p>
                <p>In any case, Dayan eventually succumbed to Sam Lewis' beguiling efforts and gave
                    us the details of those meetings of which we had had bits and pieces of through
                    various intelligence means, but we didn't know everything.</p>
                <p>From that point onward our Embassy in Tel Aviv became the conduit for all of the
                    messages going back and forth between Cairo and Jerusalem. The bulk of that
                    became my responsibility. Clearly this was a very sensitive, highly classified
                    operation. I can recall spending a great deal of my time in the weeks leading up
                    to the Sadat announcement of his impending visit handling these contacts. There
                    were, I think a few direct Israeli-Egyptian contacts outside the area, but
                    basically the two sides used the Americans to pass messages and views back and
                    forth.</p>
                <p>I do recall a very secret visit that we arranged shortly before the Sadat visit
                    for Ezer Weizman, who at that time was the Minister of Defense in Israel. We
                    flew into Tel Aviv in the dark of the night a US Air Force aircraft from Germany
                    and I can remember picking up Ezer before dawn in an Embassy carryall and hiding
                    him under blankets and driving out to the far end of the Tel Aviv airport runway
                    and Ezer appearing from beneath these blankets and being hustled on board before
                    any of his own people could see him. I remember even the pilot and crew on the
                    plane had no idea who the passenger was or where they were going until he was on
                    board and they were in the air. He went to Cairo and met with Sadat and his
                    counterpart. Ezer, I am sure, is still dining out on that story and elaborating
                    on it. And it was rather amusing...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While this was going on, were you concerned that there
                        were elements within the Jewish political system who would love to torpedo
                        this sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>VIETS: No. I think that is a fair question, but I think the Israelis at that
                    point were desperate to get talks going with any Arab state. After all, remember
                    no offers had been laid out by anybody on what the price of a peace agreement
                    with the Israelis was going to be. That all came later.</p>
                <p>The Israelis could read the handwriting on the wall, I suppose, but remember that
                    the Israeli public didn't know that this was going on. That, in it self, is a
                    remarkable moment in the history of the State of Israel. If we think of
                    Washington as a big piece of Swiss cheese where no secrets can be kept, I must
                    say Tel Aviv puts Washington in most respects to shame. There are a few core
                    secrets in Israel, for example, issues relating to their nuclear capability, on
                    which indeed their lips are sealed, but almost everything else within minutes,
                    hours or days of the event or conversation taking place gets into the most
                    active media world I have ever served in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well you and obviously our Embassy in Egypt, Hermann Eilts
                        was Ambassador, knew what was going on since you were acting as
                        communicators. Were you also acting as advisers in suggesting the next
                        move?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Yes, we did both. I think both Embassies were very, very conscious of the
                    need to insure that neither party was getting a skewed view of what the other
                    side was trying to say. We didn't shade messages, but we might interpret them.
                    We might say, “If you responded in this fashion this is probably the response
                    you will get.” That kind of role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is quite a different thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: We passed the stuff back and forth without putting any input...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the role of Washington? Here is something that
                        is going on and the policy makers in Washington must have been itching to
                        get heavily involved in this type of thing. Did you have a feeling that this
                        was being tightly controlled?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Obviously Washington by its very nature wants to be the mother hen on
                    everything that is both unimportant and important. We, I think, were punctilious
                    and professional in keeping Washington informed about what was going on. We were
                    repeating, where there was cable traffic, all of the cable traffic. I would
                    several times a day have conversations over secure voice telephone with people
                    in Washington about what was going on. And certainly Sam would have very lengthy
                    conversations, sometimes daily.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>No, I feel confident that they were kept apprized of everything that was
                    important. There were, by definition, all kinds of telephone calls back and
                    forth between our Embassy in Tel Aviv and our Embassy in Cairo, that Washington
                    wasn't monitoring. It was up to both Embassies to insure in the cause of the day
                    that they reported to their respective Desk what had gone on.</p>
                <p>I should add that the point was reached in which I felt that the moment had
                    arrived for the Egyptians and the Israelis to begin to deal with some of these
                    issues directly. I vividly recall one day getting a telephone call from Prime
                    Minister Begin's office, a man named Ben Eliezar who at that time was his
                    principal chief of staff. He asked me to pass what was a very anodyne
                    administrative type message to the Egyptians through our Embassy. I think I must
                    have been up all night the night before or something was wrong because I was
                    quite testy with him. I remember saying, “For God sake Eli, I think it is time
                    that you guys just pick up the phone and contact the guy who is going to be
                    receiving this on the other end and say this to them directly. This is
                    ridiculous for us to be acting in this role. We will be happy to continue doing
                    whatever we can to facilitate things, but this is getting silly.” I remember him
                    saying, “I agree. Do you think the Egyptians will answer the phone?” I said,
                    “Well, here is the phone number, try it.” And he did. From that point onward,
                    the Israelis and the Egyptians both started their direct bilateral contacts. I
                    am sure that somebody in American intelligence has never forgiven me, but there
                    were other ways of keeping track of this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find as you were watching these messages going
                        back and forth that there was a difference in approach between the Egyptians
                        and Israelis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Absolutely. I should preface this by saying that this was a period of
                    intense high pressure on all of us at the Embassy. Looking back on it it has
                    just become a jet speed kaleidoscope of events and I wish that my memory were
                    better so that I could answer these questions with greater acuity. But we were
                    all totally exhausted. I was probably getting on average about 3-4 hours of
                    sleep a night for weeks on end. In those circumstances, that part of your brain
                    that stores things sometimes doesn't do very well. But my general response to
                    your question is yes. I think you could see always in at least the more
                    important substantive messages the omnipresent Israeli toughness. The Israeli
                    view on negotiations, understandably, and perhaps quite rightly, is to reach way
                    beyond the possible, assuming that by the end of the negotiation you may be back
                    about where you want to be. On the other hand, I think the Egyptians generally
                    took the attitude that you should start out with a fairly sensible proposition
                    and take it from there. It took them quite a while to realize the Israelis would
                    always whittle away at it, shape and form it to their requirements.</p>
                <p>That is not to suggest that the Egyptians were always sensible. They weren't.
                    They can be excruciatingly exasperating when they want to be. And they can be as
                    bureaucratic as the best of them and certainly they can be as fuzzy if not more
                    fuzzy than anybody I ever worked with when they wanted to be.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>But as time went on both sides, I think, pretty much got the measure of each
                    other and began to calibrate their messages, responses and reactions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are talking about this heavy load of work. I take it
                        for a good part of the time...this was before Sadat made the
                        announcement...that the heavy load was going on in that period too. Is that
                        correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: That is correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously your wife was noticing, but everybody else must
                        have been noticing the Ambassador, the DCM and a few other people...I mean,
                        here it is a bright sunny day outside and they are walking around looking
                        harassed and there is nothing on the horizon that looks particularly
                        menacing or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, by definition Tel Aviv is a screwy Embassy to work in and I don't
                    think it took long for anybody who was there to figure out that there was a good
                    bit that went on in the US-Israeli relationship that was handled by the
                    Ambassador exclusively or by the Ambassador and the DCM. Occasionally bits and
                    pieces of this floated down to other senior officers. But it wasn't one of those
                    wide open missions where everybody knows exactly what the Ambassador and the DCM
                    have done all day long because they would tell everybody about it in the next
                    day's staff meeting.</p>
                <p>People were accustomed to seeing a lot of closed doors and a lot of cars coming
                    back in the dark of the night. The poor communicators were accustomed to knowing
                    that at 2 or 3 in the morning they were going to be asked to send a NIACT
                    IMMEDIATE or FLASH message on what was going on. It was just the nature of that
                    installation at that particular period. It may still be the same, but I doubt
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This whole thing was opened up when Sadat made the
                        announcement. Was this agreed upon, because certainly it would make it much
                        stronger if Sadat made the statement rather than a joint declaration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: No, my recollection is that this was a unilateral decision on his part and
                    “bang” there it was. We may have had a little bit of advance notice, but I don't
                    think very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it hit the Israelis the same way?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>VIETS: Oh, yes. It blew that country right off the map.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Embassy's and Washington's reaction? How did
                        we see the Israeli's response and how did we play with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, it would have been better to tape this at the moment because you
                    surely would have received a more accurate answer to that question. I don't
                    think that either Sam or I were at all surprised. You could see this symphony
                    being created, if that is the right metaphor, and one knew ultimately that
                    either there was going to be bilateral talks or the thing would blow up, one or
                    the other. It came very close to blowing up any number of times. Here's where I
                    think Hermann Eilts and Sam Lewis and perhaps one or two of the rest of us made
                    the difference. We kept it going in those moments when it started veering
                    off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is where we are talking about not shading the answers
                        but working on the formulation of the answers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: That is correct. Or simply sitting down with people and saying, “God damn
                    it, don't pay any attention to that, this is what you ought to have your eye on,
                    and this is what ought to be your goal. Here are some ideas of how to go after
                    it.” Sam, for example, spent many, many hours almost every day with people like
                    Moshe Dayan, either during the day or late at night. Dayan lived outside of Tel
                    Aviv, not in Jerusalem, so it was easy to spend evenings with him. And Sam
                    certainly spent hours and hours with Begin. And when he wasn't in Tel Aviv I was
                    doing the same routine.</p>
                <p>So, as I said, I don't think either one of us was at all surprised, but because
                    this had been so carefully controlled by Begin and Sadat, it did come as a bomb
                    shell in Israel. My recollection is that there was literally dancing in the
                    streets and all the rest. It was a nation that suddenly after all those years of
                    having been a pariah, somebody recognized that you existed and spoke to you. In
                    the ensuing emotional outburst it unleashed a great deal of unrealistic hope on
                    the part of the Israelis that this meant perhaps the beginning of the end of
                    Israel's isolation throughout the Arab world. After all, the Egyptians were the
                    center of the Arab world and if the Egyptians did this it would be so much
                    easier for everybody else, etc.</p>
                <p>I think in a sense those unrealistic views have for some Israelis perhaps existed
                    to this day. I haven't ever quite understood how the Egyptians could do this and
                    why it didn't open the way for others.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>I recall after the visit itself there was a great rash of naming children, twins,
                    Begin and Sadat. One little personal anecdote, I remember a dinner that Moshe
                    Dayan and Ezer Weizman gave at the Jerusalem Hilton for Secretary of State
                    Vance, who was there for a visit trying to keep the game alive. Students of this
                    era will remember that after the initial euphoria of Sadat's visit, both the
                    Egyptians and Israelis began to tighten their positions and things slowed down
                    in a hurry for a while. Again, that is where, I think the Americans won their
                    equivalent of the diplomatic Nobel Peace Prize by really being basically
                    responsible for keeping it going.</p>
                <p>In any case, I recall at this dinner, half way through, Vance, who was sitting
                    with Mr. Begin, crooked a finger at me. I left my table and went over. He wanted
                    me to deliver a message to somebody in Washington. While I was standing behind
                    his chair talking to him, Begin reached over and in his usual punctilious
                    fashion, greeted me warmly and asked, as he always did, after my wife and
                    children. I always tried to have a semi-jocular relationship with Begin and I
                    said, “Mr. Prime Minister, I have something to report to you in this post-Sadat
                    era of naming children after you and Mr. Sadat. My middle daughter Kasha, has
                    bought two fish. One is named Begin and one is named Sadat.” He smiled and
                    laughed and said, “This is going on all over, isn't it.” I said, “Well, I am
                    reluctant to tell you, but one of them the night before last killed the other
                    one.” He immediately in his quick witted fashion said, “Did Begin kill Sadat or
                    Sadat Begin?”</p>
                <p>In a sense that little story is a metaphor of what was going on at that very
                    moment. Tensions were rising. Begin was beginning his very hard line approach in
                    reaction to Sadat's demands for a total pull out in Sinai, resolution of
                    Palestinian issue, etc., and he was beginning very carefully to lay out his
                    markers about what Israel would and would not accept. Sadat, I think, was
                    perhaps somewhat confused and frustrated over the fact that he had made, in his
                    eyes, and I think most Israelis would agree, a great personal gamble and taken a
                    very courageous step, and it wasn't being accepted in the same fashion and
                    manner in which he had made it. It had immediately become kind of a bizarre
                    negotiation. And that caused some bitterness, to put it mildly, within the
                    Egyptian policy community and Sadat's entourage. This is where Hermann Eilts
                    earned his keep and Sam Lewis earned his.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we trying to let the Israelis know that Sadat had
                        done something that was really very dangerous politically and physically for
                        him? People in the Arab world would be out gunning for him and not to waste
                        this moment because he might not be around.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>VIETS: Certainly we were taking a line similar to that. But the Israelis in their
                    own fashion had their own reactions. I think that, again I don't want to turn
                    into a psychiatrist, but it does seem to me that when you have a society that
                    has been a pariah, and that really is the right word for many, many years...a
                    whole generation of Israelis had grown up in an environment in which essentially
                    nobody in the region in which they lived had recognized them, spoken to them,
                    indeed at various times tried to do them in...it is perhaps too much to expect
                    that society overnight to trust what the first person to come down the pipe
                    offers is a peace initiative. This is asking a great deal of any society.</p>
                <p>Again, this is 1992 and we are still seeing those delayed reactions. Remember,
                    this is a society that has been shaped and formed by an adversarial relationship
                    and has not known any relationship in which one is treated as an equal or one is
                    treated as something other than an enemy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to get a little personal thing on this, how did you
                        see anything you did that might be worth mentioning during the Sadat visit
                        in 1977?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I am probably the last person to ask that question of because literally on
                    the day of the visit we had essentially all of our Embassy out on the street in
                    Jerusalem, Tel Aviv, and God knows where else, in order to pull together the
                    appropriate reporting messages. Dick Viets played the role of DCM by staying
                    home and minding the fires. So I watched it on a television set in my office.
                    But I had no role, whatsoever, that day. I only heard all the wonderful stories
                    from my wife and my colleagues who were there. I wasn't present.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the Sadat visit it moved into a period of joint
                        negotiations. Were our Embassies in Cairo and Tel Aviv still playing
                        somewhat the same role, or had the play moved more to being directed from
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I think at that point Washington certainly became the senior partner in
                    all of this and we were subsidiary, because at that point you were talking about
                    policies that required very top echelons in this government to make decisions
                    on. I think one of the professional thrills of that period was knowing that
                    whatever you were drafting was being read by the President personally, by the
                    National Security Adviser and the Secretary of State. I still have somewhere in
                    my personal archives in the Department a variety of copies of telegrams that I
                    had done as Charg� with writings on the margin from the President, Brzezinski
                    and Secretary Vance, etc. There aren't too many times in any Foreign Service
                    officer's career when you know you are talking directly to the boss. That in
                    itself is a sufficient inducement to survive on four hours less sleep a night
                    than normal.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that point was your main purpose to interpret how the
                        Israelis were reacting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Again, I have trouble remembering the details of that period precisely. It
                    really is a blur to me. The fact that Camp David was held, I think in itself is
                    part of an answer to your question. A few weeks later things really were not
                    going very well and the I think the feeling on the part of the President and his
                    senior advisers was that the moment had arrived for the United States simply to
                    lock people up in a room and hammer out an agreement; that it was drifting and
                    it was always a risk that one or the other would simply say, “Enough of
                    this.”</p>
                <p>As I am talking I am constantly comparing in my mind the environment then with
                    the environment today in peace talks that are starting up again this very
                    morning that we are talking. I remember the frustrations that began to develop
                    in the region when nothing seemed to be happening as a result of this wonderful
                    Sadat visit when emotions and hopes ran so high. It just seemed to tail off into
                    endless volleys of diplomatic exchanges and sharp off-the-record comments,
                    leaks, etc., by both sides. The constituency always needed in any prolonged
                    negotiation of this nature, began to erode. There was no tangible evidence,
                    either for the Israelis or the Egyptians, that the game was necessarily worth
                    the price. The same thing is true today, I think. But fortunately wisdom
                    prevailed. There was a political and policy leadership in this city who saw this
                    as a moment in history that should be grasped irrespective of the dangers that
                    it would blow up in your face. And they grasped it and forced it through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting from your Israeli contacts as the
                        negotiations seemed to be drifting that the United States should come in get
                        the thing back on track</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: There were people like Ezer Weizman who were saying precisely that, who
                    were growing frustrated over the actions of their own government. Ezer was one
                    who was extremely critical of elements of his own government's policies. I can't
                    speak for what was going on in Cairo. The Israelis had then, and still have,
                    thank God, a very free press which meant that the media was full of analysis and
                    as always advice to the government over what to do. So it wasn't a depressed
                    public debate at all, it was a very lively one. But frustration was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a sense of relief from your point of view when
                        President Carter called the Camp David meeting?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>VIETS: Oh yes, very much. You may remember during Camp David, itself, the press
                    was miles away and it was a very tightly controlled negotiation. I really didn't
                    know many of the details of what was going on because there were no daily
                    reporting cables coming out of Thurmont, Maryland. I didn't learn many of the
                    details until Sam flew back to Tel Aviv. I can remember the morning after he
                    arrived going to his residence, sitting down by the swimming pool in the hot
                    Mediterranean sun, while he went through several hours of notes that he had
                    taken. He knew what he was doing during Camp David and took very extensive
                    notes, which unfortunately have never seen a book, but someday may.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I will tell you in a way what is happening to those notes,
                        he has been doing a series of Oral Histories with us which has been going on
                        for a few years. Peter Jessup is doing the interviewing. I think he was
                        Station Chief or something like that. Anyway, Peter is a professional oral
                        historian and Sam has been basically dictating his memoirs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Just to continue this parenthesis, when he retired he started work on a
                    book which was really to be a political memoir of that period couched in the
                    greater context of the US-Israeli relationship. He worked on it for several
                    months, maybe a little longer, and I think got half way through or so and
                    decided there were other ways he wanted to spend his time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left shortly after the Camp David thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I left there in August, 1979. There is one anecdote that has come to mind.
                    Again I can't place precisely when it took place, but you will recall that the
                    negotiations on a peace treaty between Egypt and Israel began to flounder very
                    badly. President Carter who was in the midst of gearing up for his re-election
                    campaign clearly saw not only the historical importance of getting a peace
                    treaty between Israel and Egypt accomplished, but also that this would be a
                    major accomplishment of his administration. He also realized that things had
                    probably reached the point where he, the President, would have to reinsert
                    himself between Begin and Sadat. So he flew to the area.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>I remember clearly the first meeting that took place after his arrival in the
                    cabinet room of the Israeli Prime Minister's office. The room was full of people
                    around this very long cabinet table, as well as in the row of chairs along the
                    wall...both Israelis and Americans. Obviously everybody wanted to be there. The
                    Israelis are exactly like the Americans, the second and third echelon people
                    wanted to be seen as part of this. Carter took a look around the table and said,
                    “Prime Minister Begin, I really feel that we aren't going to be able to conduct
                    the kind of conversations I want with all these people here. So I am asking
                    everybody in my delegation to politely depart this room. The only people I want
                    to stay behind are Secretary Vance, Sam Lewis, Ham Jordan, Jody Powell and
                    Brzezinski [I think that was it.].” So we all started to get up. Begin quickly
                    said, “Well, I agree.” And he asked his people to depart. As I walked by Begin's
                    chair, he turned to me and said, “Dick, you are not leaving, you can't leave.”
                    To have a Prime Minister of a country to which you are accredited say something
                    like that obviously raises certain questions as to where you come from. He
                    turned to the President and said words to the effect, “Mr. Viets has played a
                    very important role in all of this and really deserves to stay and I would like
                    to have him stay.” So the President said, “Well, Dick, you are staying.”</p>
                <p>So I had the pleasure of sitting in that meeting which went on and on and on. It
                    reached just a dreadful deadlock. The President finally said, “Prime Minister, I
                    suggest that we take a break and consult with our colleagues because we are
                    going nowhere and we really need to break this off for a bit and take a rest.”
                    So Begin and his team got up and left the cabinet room. I will always remember
                    this moment. The President of the United States took his shoes off and put his
                    stocking feet on the cabinet table and put his head in his hands and began to
                    rock back and forth, almost like a child in pain. And then a very strange thing
                    happened. Hamilton Jordan and Jody Powell walked up and sat down on either side
                    of the President and began to speak to him in some of the crudest language I
                    have ever heard any man address to a superior. The essence of their words was,
                    “For God's sake, Mr. President, put something up your derriere and get on with
                    it. Stop whimpering and feeling sorry for yourself. You can crack this nut, you
                    can win this, etc., etc. You can win this but you have to get with it.” The
                    language was very earthy, Southern lingo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were both Georgia loyalists who had been with the
                        President right from the beginning.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: That is right and you could see they were probably the only people in the
                    world who could talk to the President of the United States in this fashion. I
                    found it most fascinating and terribly embarrassing to be present at a moment
                    when the President of the United States was being addressed in this fashion by
                    two, albeit old, friends, but who were nevertheless subordinates. And in front
                    of a group of people who shouldn't have been there!</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>In any case, the President responded positively to this dressing down by his two
                    old friends and took charge of things. We very quickly decided what we were
                    going to do when the Israelis came back. The President made it very clear he
                    would leave if the renewed session again devolved into endless bickering. He
                    asked me to go outside and telephone somebody on the staff and tell them to get
                    the aircrew of Air Force One ready, that the session might bust up at any moment
                    and he would want to get out of Israel in a big hurry.</p>
                <p>So Begin and company came back into the room. Against all rules of the game I
                    wrote a note to Ezer Weizman, who was one of the few Israelis that Begin
                    trusted...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was Minister of Defense?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: He was still Minister of Defense at that time.</p>
                <p>I said in the note, “Ezer, you should know that the President has ordered Air
                    Force One ready to take off. This thing is just going over the cliff unless you
                    guys get your act together.” I passed it across the table to Weizman. He read
                    it; looked at me; got up and showed the note to the Foreign Minister, Moshe
                    Dayan. Dayan read it and looked across the table at me and I nodded. Dayan, who
                    was sitting next to Begin, showed the note to him and there was a kind of
                    silence among the Israelis. Dayan then said, “You know I have perhaps an idea
                    that might work us out of this box we are in,” and proceeded to develop his
                    idea. Carter chimed in that he thought the proposal was great and he could work
                    with it. Within 15 minutes things were on the way to being resolved and it was
                    agreed that the President and Begin would meet again that evening and settle
                    it.</p>
                <p>So again one never knows in life what the results of even the smallest actions
                    are. That meeting may well have ended in great success in any case, but this
                    certainly gave some impetus to resolution of the immediate crisis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of nailing down the obvious, sometimes there is the
                        idea that everything can be done from Washington and a foreign capital and
                        you don't need people on the ground, but there are times that it is
                        absolutely essential that you have built up trust. In the first place
                        somebody from Washington couldn't have passed that note because they
                        wouldn't have known that person or cared. If nothing else, this is one of
                        those instances that shows what embassies do. They build up trust,
                        confidence so that in times of crisis they know somebody is talking
                        straight.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, it is also I think that you know every day of this life people
                    serving Presidents and Prime Ministers and others are constantly doing this sort
                    of thing and very little of this ever gets into anybody's memoirs. But that is
                    what history is made of. It has always intrigued me, these little tiny episodes
                    that take on such historical significance.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is, of course, as we develop this oral history
                        what we are trying to do. It is not to highlight but to show that there are
                        a bunch of people running around carrying spears, etc. who keep the
                        machinery going. Before we leave Israeli, what was your view of Sharon at
                        the time you left in 1977, because he before and particularly later led
                        Israel down a disastrous road into invading Lebanon in which he pretty much
                        controlled things and did it without any real direction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Sharon during that period was under a much tighter leash then he
                    subsequently was. He was Minister of Agriculture and while there was no doubt in
                    anybody's mind what his political views were...he never tried to mask it. On the
                    contrary I can remember going any number of times to see him at his office in
                    Jerusalem and he would lay out on a big table his maps of the West Bank and show
                    me the roads he was planning to build or were already being constructed. For
                    every Congressional delegation that came he would have military helicopters and
                    fly them up to some of the higher points in the West Bank and show them the
                    famous narrow salient. So he was very open and aggressive in a more controlled
                    fashion then he subsequently became over espousing his views.</p>
                <p>My recollection is that he became Minister of Defense about the time I was
                    leaving because I do remember a ship visit where the visiting admiral gave a
                    dinner on board the fantail of his cruiser and I recall going up with Sharon for
                    that dinner with our wives. But the bulk of my time he was Minister of
                    Agriculture and was, therefore, essentially cut out of all the diplomatic toing
                    and froing that took place between Israel and Egypt and Washington. He really
                    wasn't that much of a factor. Begin was supreme during that period. Nobody could
                    take him on politically and survive. Even Moshe Dayan was very careful in the
                    way in which he handled Mr. Begin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Therefore an American President could go in and deal with
                        an Israeli Prime Minister at that point, when other times that an American
                        President might go, a Prime Minister of almost any country might have to
                        have almost the whole cabinet there because of shared power.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: That's right. It was a combination of factors. Begin had a very powerful
                    personality. He was a very shrewd, tough politician who knew how to run a
                    cabinet. While I don't think he will ever go down in the history of Israel as
                    one of the great prime ministers in terms of the type of government he gave
                    Israel, he is certainly firmly ensconced in the history books for what he did on
                    the Egyptian peace treaty. And that was clearly his major goal. He had a great
                    sense of history and he damn well wanted to insure that he had a place in
                    history, and he did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question on the Israeli thing, looking at our
                        Embassy, how did you view Israeli specialists? It is always very difficult
                        to recruit people because it is somewhat limited to one country and makes
                        them a little bit suspect in the Arab countries. How useful were they and
                        how did you feel about them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: This is unfortunately a very sensitive subject and I am going to address
                    it frontally because it is a subject that is generally avoided. People prefer to
                    sidestep it. During the period I served in Israel, 1977-79, we were blessed with
                    a group of a half dozen or so FSOs of Jewish origin who were bilingual in
                    Hebrew, who were exceedingly talented young officers whose contribution to the
                    United States Government's understanding, and most particularly to Sam Lewis'
                    and Dick Viets' understanding of what was going on in Israel, is hard to
                    overstate.</p>
                <p>That said, everyone serving in Embassy Tel Aviv was on the receiving end of
                    unremitting pressure by Israelis in and out of government [or an intensity I
                    never experienced anywhere else in the world] to be sympathetic to Israeli
                    policies and points of view. All of us at one time or another found it very
                    tough to handle these pressures. Our Jewish colleagues were special targets, of
                    course. Without going into any personal details, there were moments when some of
                    them did not handle these pressures very well. The emotional weight laid on them
                    simply was too great.</p>
                <p>I have always felt, and nothing has happened in my life since then to moderate my
                    views one iota, that there are times and situations when special heed must be
                    given to ethnic and religious roots in making personnel assignments. Not to do
                    so risks potentially difficult problems for both the individual and the Foreign
                    Service. However imprudent this view may be in our outrageously (at times)
                    politically correct society, I feel it must be said.</p>

                <p>VIETS: I know some people reading this transcript will immediately feel that what
                    they are reading is a closely disguised anti-Semitic smite by Dick Viets. Quite
                    the contrary. I think anyone who knows my record in Israel would not find that
                    to be true. But I am now speaking as someone who has had some responsibility in
                    the Foreign Service for managing people in such situations. I am appalled when I
                    read, for example, that we are sending to country X an officer I worked with for
                    several years, who was born and raised in that country and is now going back as
                    ambassador. I think he is being put in a most difficult personal and
                    professional position. No matter how hard he works to maintain his balance, the
                    moment will surely come when his emotions will overcome his professional
                    self-discipline. In this instance because he will be the Chief of Mission there
                    will be no one above him to save him from himself. I truly feel sorry for my
                    friend. The Republic has done neither him nor itself a favor in making this
                    assignment.</p>

                <p>VIETS: This is the area of the world that I was just referring to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is something we are all aware of.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, not, apparently, some of the people who make these personnel
                    decisions. The defense offered always is that these are fine Americans. And they
                    are fine Americans. But I had been seduced over the years in any number of
                    societies I have worked in and I have no roots in those societies whatsoever. I
                    can only imagine how much faster I would have been seduced if I were Irish and
                    in Ireland, or Jewish and in Israel or Chinese and in China. This is human
                    nature and has nothing to do with one's Americanism or patriotism, or
                    professionalism. It is human nature.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We will cut it off here and the next time around we will
                        go to Tanzania. How is that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Let's do it the year after next!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is January 14, 1993 and this is continuing the
                        interview with Dick Viets. After Israel you get your first ambassadorial
                        assignment. Could you tell me how this came about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, one never, of course, knows the full story behind any decision of
                    this nature. But during my posting in Israel I think over forty percent of the
                    time my Ambassador, Sam Lewis, was traveling to or from Washington. And he had a
                    certain amount of regional travel to boot. As we have discussed earlier, this
                    was an intensely active diplomatic period leading up to the Camp David agreement
                    and, following that, all the negotiations related to the Egyptian-Israel peace
                    treaty. This required Sam's physical presence in Washington for a great number
                    of meetings, consultations, etc. So I was left minding the store for long
                    periods of time and very frequently. Because life did not stop while Sam was
                    away, there were still lots of things going on in Israel and there were high
                    level meetings almost every day of the week with the Prime Minister, the Defense
                    Minister, etc. We had terrible problems up on the Lebanese border at that point
                    with Israeli incursions into Lebanon...sound familiar?...to which President
                    Carter was adamantly opposed. So we were constantly hammering the Israelis to
                    stay on their side of the border.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>In consequence I suppose I developed a higher than usual profile for a Charg� in
                    Washington. I can remember indeed getting phone calls from the Department saying
                    that the President has called the Secretary on your meeting with Begin and wants
                    to congratulate you, etc. It was all very heady stuff for a guy who still didn't
                    have a totally white head of hair. I also, of course, during this period got to
                    know Secretary Vance fairly well because he was coming through regularly and I,
                    myself, was going occasionally back to Washington.</p>
                <p>The sum of all this being that one's name got to be known fairly well. In 1979
                    you will recall that we were in the final phase of our negotiation with the
                    British, with the Rhodesians and with the soon-to-be Zimbabwean independent
                    state.</p>
                <p>The US was extremely active in this negotiation. In fact, in retrospect, I am not
                    sure that historians have yet really given the credit I think due to the Carter
                    administration, particularly Secretary Vance and his immediate
                    subordinates...people like Chet Crocker and Steve Low, etc...for the
                    extraordinary efforts they made that culminated in this peaceful transfer of
                    power from whites to blacks in what was seen to be one of the more insolvable of
                    the world's standoffs between whites and blacks.</p>
                <p>At that time in mid-1979, the so-called front line states in Southern Africa, I
                    think there were five of them ...the organization was chaired by Julius Nyerere,
                    the President of Tanzania, a very remarkable gentleman. Nyerere really towered
                    over the other four heads of state and this organization in many respects was a
                    one man operation. Because of his long association with the independence
                    movements in East Africa and throughout Southern Africa he was highly respected.
                    Nyerere is an intellectual of very considerable dimensions, an extraordinarily
                    articulate person. So the leadership of this group was essentially his without
                    any challenge. He was offering almost daily advise to the Zimbabwean leadership
                    on tactics, strategy, etc. in their negotiations with the British and the
                    Americans and the others involved.</p>
                <p>We had a very competent Ambassador named Jim Spain in Tanzania at that time who
                    had been there for about five years. Jim had played a remarkable role in
                    counseling, advising, pressing, pulling Nyerere in an attempt to shape his
                    views, not always successfully. There was a strong view in Washington and I
                    think the Secretary, himself, felt strongly about it, that Nyerere needed a good
                    bit of handling and Jim's time had come to an end. So I was the designated
                    hitter. I think, as far as I know, it was Secretary Vance who decided this. I
                    knew Carter fairly well at that point and he went along with it. So off I
                    went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any problems with confirmation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: None. This was almost a pro forma hearing.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You obviously had not been in the area. What were you
                        getting from the Desk, the African Bureau and maybe in the corridors, about
                        Tanzania? Being in the Foreign Service and not in the area, to me the word
                        was out that here is this guy Nyerere who is brilliant, a great speaker, but
                        ruining his country. That he had got caught up in the British left wing
                        social thing and was a disaster. This was the impression I heard. What
                        impression did you go out with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, I went out with a lot of impressions of that nature. I should say
                    that from the moment I was first alerted that I was selected as Ambassador,
                    while I was still in Israel, I made arrangements with the Department to receive
                    all of the important cable traffic between Washington and Dar es Salaam as well
                    as some of the regional cable traffic relating to the negotiation. I did that to
                    try to get a running start while I was still in Tel Aviv.</p>
                <p>There was a second reason for this. Sam Lewis would not let me go from Israel and
                    had a commitment from the Secretary that I would not be released until after a
                    successor had been designated who Sam approved of. There is a rather amusing
                    anecdote behind all that. My first candidate was someone whom Sam Lewis had
                    never met. A gentleman by the name of William Brown with whom I had served in
                    India back in the early sixties. Bill was a Chinese language specialist, a hydra
                    headed monster. He was both a Chinese language specialist and Russian area
                    specialist...a very rare bird, and an exceptionally capable officer. It seemed
                    to me that Bill had a great many of the qualities that would serve Lewis very
                    well and more importantly the United States government and the Embassy in Israel
                    well. Bill at that point was in Taiwan running that curious organization, whose
                    name I don't even remember, which was in fact...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A liaison office.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, we didn't even call it a liaison office. It was a fancier name. But
                    in effect it was our Embassy. I called Bill on the transpacific telephone from
                    Tel Aviv, tracked him down, and after the pleasantries I told him in three or
                    four sentences why I was calling him. And there was a long pause and then a kind
                    of giggle over the phone and he said, “Dick, do you know where I am taking this
                    phone call?” I said, “No, I don't.” He said, “Well, I am lying on a chaise
                    lounge beside one of the most beautiful swimming pools in the world. I am
                    waiting for my Chinese butler to bring me one of the best Chinese meals you will
                    find anywhere in the world, cooked by one of the best Chinese cooks anywhere in
                    the world. I probably will put in at least an hour of work today and the rest of
                    the day I am going to spend reading and perhaps play a little tennis, have a
                    couple of swims. This is the best assignment and the best kept secret assignment
                    in the world. And if you think I am going to trade this to go to Israel and work
                    my butt off, you are absolutely crazy, so get off the line and let me get back
                    to my snooze.” I said, “Well, Bill, we all have moments when we have to do
                    things that we don't like and you are going to come to Israel.” “Well, the hell
                    I am. It is nice talking to you Dick and just forget it. There is no way I am
                    going to be moved from this place.”</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>I had by then sold Lewis on the fact that Brown was the man. And Sam Lewis, who
                    is one of the world's greater behind the scenes operators, without Bill Brown
                    knowing what had happened, arranged to have Bill brought back to Washington on
                    consultation at a time when Sam, himself, would be in Washington on
                    consultation. He backed Bill Brown up against the wall and said, “You are coming
                    to Israel.” Well, in fact, Bill came to Israel. And, indeed, to finish off the
                    story, Bill served out two or three years as Deputy Chief of Mission, went on to
                    Thailand as Ambassador and a couple of years later returned to Tel Aviv as the
                    US Ambassador to Israel. So I always felt that I made a fairly good choice.</p>
                <p>Sam, having got all of this finally lined up, let me depart in September, 1979. I
                    still remember that series of farewells in Tel Aviv. It is probably the only
                    country in the world, of substance, where you can just turn out the entire
                    government to see you off. A lot of that was testimony to my very remarkable
                    wife who had made a great hit in Israel.</p>
                <p>In any case, off we went. I do not frankly recall at this point when I got to
                    Dar. It seems that there was a delay in Congressional hearings due to recess or
                    something, but we got there in the Fall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you went out you were going to focus on the area.
                        How did you manage that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I realized in my preparation for the assignment that the major focus in
                    preparation should really be in learning everything I could about Julius
                    Nyerere. The historical side of the preparation was fairly easy to do. Tanzanian
                    history is not that complex. I decided that one of the ways to do this was to go
                    around and see every American Ambassador who had ever served in Dar es
                    Salaam.</p>
                <p>I did this because I realized firstly, as I just said, that Nyerere was the key
                    to my success, or lack of success, in that assignment and secondly, because as I
                    read Jim Spain's reporting cables back to Washington it became increasingly
                    clear to me that he had developed a remarkably close personal relationship with
                    Nyerere. They had become very, very good friends. As a consequence I think Jim
                    had had a great deal of influence on Nyerere. Nyerere had been trained by the
                    Jesuits as a young man and so had Jim. They were both strong, practicing
                    Catholics. That was an immediate bond.</p>
                <p>And they had developed a wonderful game. Every call on Mr. Nyerere, which usually
                    was at Nyerere's seaside house and not at his office...he preferred to do
                    business out on the porch of his house...one or the other would open the
                    conversation with a quotation of some renowned Catholic philosopher or a
                    Biblical quotation and before the end of the conversation the other person was
                    supposed to complete the quotation and identify its genesis.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>Well, this had gone on for five years. The bond between these two men was very
                    strong. Obviously I had studied a lot of school boy Latin, but I was not
                    Catholic and I was not steeped in Church history and my memory of biblical
                    quotations, to say nothing of Latin quotations, is pretty thin. I realized if I
                    wasn't going to be able to do that, I had better have some alternative
                    intellectual horsepower that could compensate for it. And that was the reason
                    why I decided I needed to know more about Julius Nyerere than anybody else on
                    the face of the earth.</p>
                <p>And, as I was saying to you earlier, it was the first and last assignment I ever
                    had in the Foreign Service that I did start with a sense of confidence that
                    after a period of settling in I could get on top of the job relatively well. I
                    strongly believe that no Foreign Service officer is worth his salt if,
                    irrespective of his lack of regional knowledge of an area, he can't operate well
                    after an initial start-up period. But for the first time because of Jim's
                    intense and close relationship with Nyerere, who was effectively the key to our
                    influence in East Africa, and more importantly, the key to influencing the
                    Zimbabwean leadership it was important I be able to develop quickly a strong
                    personal relationship with Nyerere.</p>
                <p>The last American Ambassador to Tanzania that I saw before departing for Dar was
                    a gentleman who is no longer living, but I think should go nameless because of
                    the nature of the story I am going to tell you. I remember he was posted in
                    Washington at that time in a sort of nonsense job. He was getting ready to
                    retire. I recall walking into his office...he was a great tall, imposing man. He
                    got out of his chair and came around his desk. I introduced myself, we had never
                    met, and sat down. I candidly told him that for the first time in my life I was
                    starting an assignment with some lack of confidence. I knew that he had also
                    enjoyed a strong relationship with Nyerere and had served there during a very
                    tough period...there had been a kidnapping of some Americans and he was involved
                    in negotiating their release. But I said that the man who had clearly set the
                    standard was Jim Spain and I went into the Latin quotation business, etc.This
                    gentleman sat there with a grin growing on his face as I went on explaining why
                    I felt so ill prepared to go down and deal with this great fellow. I finished
                    and he looked at me and he said, “Dick, let me tell you something. Jim Spain and
                    I and all our other predecessors, all developed the world's greatest
                    relationship with Nyerere. Why? Because it was Nyerere who developed the
                    relationships. He is a very shrewd man and knows that he is going to need to
                    develop a very close relationship with any American who is sent down as chief of
                    mission in that country. You don't need to worry. Nyerere will make sure that a
                    different game is found. You are going to find that you are going to do just as
                    well if not better than any of your predecessors. This is a lot of bull shit
                    that Jim Spain has handled it better than I did or anybody else. So don't think
                    that it won't go well.”</p>
                <p>And, indeed, I have to say that when I left Dar es Salaam I was absolutely
                    convinced that I had a better relationship with Julius Nyerere than any American
                    Ambassador who had ever set foot in that country!</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>But, going back to your original question on Nyerere, he was, he is, because he
                    is still living, a most remarkable figure in contemporary African political
                    history. I always said, and others who knew him well I think shared this view,
                    that if Nyerere had been born in Western Europe or the Far East or even in North
                    America, he would have been an exceptional figure in public life. He was a
                    superb politician. He had an acute brain, the memory of an elephant,
                    intellectual horsepower that was second to none. He was cunning. He could be
                    warm-hearted one moment and cut you off at the legs at the next if it met his
                    political or personal needs. He had, of course, been the principal political
                    figure behind the Tanzanian independence movement in the 1950s.</p>
                <p>He had been the great hope, I think, of the British when they were departing East
                    Africa. Here was the man exceptionally well prepared to take over political
                    power in a country that was endowed with extraordinary resources ...physical
                    resources, a beautiful country...very rich in natural resources. It had an
                    agricultural base at the time of independence that was second to none in East
                    Africa. A wonderful deep water port, etc. And a stable political
                    environment.</p>
                <p>Alas, for a variety of reasons, Nyerere, while he continued to maintain a stable
                    political society...there was none of the Mau Mau type of operation that ever
                    developed in Tanzania...went in the same direction that many other African
                    political leaders did at that point, namely, that government always knew best
                    and everything should be operated by the government, everything should be
                    nationalized, and the people simply weren't ready to conduct their own affairs
                    and the government would always know best. In consequence the economy went into
                    a tailspin and even to this day, 1993, the Tanzanian economy is a vastly poorer
                    economy then it was on the day of independence about 30 years ago.</p>
                <p>Part of Nyerere's economic developmental philosophy surely was shaped by the
                    Fabian socialists. Various LSE professors (London School of Economics) used to
                    float in and out of Dar es Salaam offering advice to him. Also, I think he was
                    genuinely convinced that given time his particular formula for the development
                    of Tanzania would turn out to be right. He believed what he first had to do was
                    to educate the population because at the time of independence it was essentially
                    an illiterate society. As I recall, other than three or four doctors there
                    wasn't a Ph.D. in the country. There was still a big British and other
                    expatriate population that ran everything from the water works to the railroad,
                    etc.</p>
                <p>Nyerere simply concluded early on that his first moves toward bringing Tanzania
                    into the second half of the 20th century must be (a) to establish a national
                    educational program, which he did; (b) to break up the big estates which had
                    been by foreigners and to divide the land among the peasantry, which he did, and
                    (c) to nationalize all the limited industry in the country so that the profits
                    derived from these organizations would go into the national treasury and not
                    turn up as dividends being repatriated to the tea or coffee market in London or
                    the gold market in Zurich. This he also did.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>Alas, as I say, all of these moves turned into an economic disaster primarily
                    because he did not have the trained cadres to run any of these things. Pretty
                    soon the Tanzanian economy developed into a basket case. The international
                    organizations such as the World Bank, IMF, etc. came to Tanzania's rescue. There
                    was one point when Tanzania was getting more international donor assistance per
                    capita then any country in the world, billions of dollars.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you got there in 1979 the structure had shown
                        where it was going. There was no doubt about it. What was the reading you
                        were getting from the people you talked to why Nyerere didn't say, “Gee,
                        maybe this isn't working”? Was he an ideologue or was it a matter of
                        political control? What was our reading for his stubbornness in driving his
                        country to economic disaster?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: You put your finger on the principal reason. He was an enormously stubborn
                    man and he did not want to admit that he had been wrong. But having said that I
                    do remember the last several months of my posting there...I was only there for a
                    year and a half because suddenly the telephone rang and I was told that our
                    masters wanted me to go as Ambassador to Jordan...I do remember the last several
                    months of my posting there...by then I had developed a pretty solid relationship
                    with Nyerere and used to frequently go out to his home and sit on his back porch
                    facing a beautiful Indian Ocean lagoon and swat the mosquitoes away as he sat
                    there in his Gucci loafers and safari suit and talked about the world and
                    Tanzania.</p>
                <p>As his confidence and trust grew in this foreign ambassador he would open up more
                    and more about his own views of the way things were going. I began to pick up
                    threads of tacit or implicit admission that he had taken some very bad turns
                    over the years and that things had to be put right. And, indeed, a couple of
                    years after I departed he left office voluntarily. That was already written on
                    the wall. I remember sending cables forecasting he was going to retire. He
                    resigned first from the office of the Presidency, but very shrewdly kept control
                    of the political party apparatus and he kept himself on as chairman of the
                    party.</p>
                <p>Perhaps the most influential person around Nyerere was a very interesting,
                    extremely intelligent English lady name Joan Wickham who had gone out to Dar es
                    Salaam as a young woman shortly after independence, or just at the time of
                    independence, and had moved into the YWCA and had volunteered to help in the
                    launching of this new East African state. She was a gifted writer and Nyerere,
                    who himself remains as far as I know the principal translator of Shakespeare
                    from English into Swahili and one of the most gifted orators I have ever heard
                    in English, and himself a marvelous drafter of the English language, spotted her
                    right away and took her into his inner circle. She remained with him all those
                    years as an inside, very private and confidential advisor. Joan was a born
                    socialist, not an economist but very well read in economy and she held some very
                    strong views on developmental economics, etc. I think, on looking back, that she
                    had helped, if not shaped his views. Certainly she buttressed many of his own
                    views.</p>

                        shambles were they blaming anybody for it? Was it a capitalist plot?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: By the time I left one clearly had developed enough relationships, not
                    simply with Nyerere, but with others so you could hold very candid conversations
                    in private. It wasn't difficult to get a conversation going in which people were
                    very open in saying that this was a mistake and that was a mistake, there was
                    corruption, etc. Overall I think there was the universal view that for whatever
                    reason, the international markets were rigged against the interests of the third
                    world. Nyerere constantly hammered at this theme. I can remember listening to
                    him rail hour after hour against the IMF and the prescriptions the IMF was
                    demanding of Tanzania that he argued would send it further into poverty, etc. He
                    would cite how many pounds of tea in 1953 it took to buy a truck and how many
                    tons of tea it took in 1979 to buy a truck. So there was certainly a sense of
                    while Tanzania had made mistakes, and most people were perfectly prepared to
                    admit that...Nyerere not publicly, but privately...there was also a strong
                    feeling that the first world, Western Europe, Japan and the United States, had
                    very carefully rigged the game so that so-called third world economies would
                    never become competitive, that they would always be at the end of a leash that
                    would be controlled by these major primary commodity markets, at that point raw
                    commodities were all that Tanzania had in terms of exports.</p>
                <p>I can't say there was a bitterness about this. It was, as you find so often in
                    societies of that nature, an almost quiescent, benign acceptance of this as
                    fate...we were born in the wrong place at the wrong time.</p>

                        could take over was one of your assignments, but other than that did you
                        feel that you as the ambassador was under any obligation to put the
                        Tanzanians on the right course as we saw it or was it any of our
                        business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: No, it wasn't all Rhodesian independence. There were three or four
                    principal issues that I got involved in. One was the Rhodesian independence
                    issue and that was my primary focus in the early months.</p>
                <p>The second issue was the estranged relationship between Tanzania and Kenya. For
                    economic reasons this was an extremely difficult period for Tanzania because the
                    borders were closed and no commerce was flowing back and forth. Thirdly, we had
                    next door in Uganda the famous Idi Amin. You will recall at one point the
                    Tanzanians sent half the Tanzanian army to get rid of Idi Amin. Julius showed in
                    that venture a little bit of the imperialist in him. He wanted to play the
                    kingmaker in Uganda and poured a lot of Tanzanian treasure into his efforts to
                    dominate the political process and formation of the new political leadership in
                    Uganda.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>One of the side benefits to this was the impact on his army which became very
                    accustomed to living very well as armies of occupation always do and they came
                    back to Tanzania to a much poorer economy. One of the immediate repercussions
                    was a sudden spurt in vicious crime, of lawlessness and the society was buffeted
                    seriously. I think to this day the domestic security situation of Tanzania is
                    more dangerous than it was prior to the incursion into Uganda.</p>
                <p>Lastly, there were serious political problems in Mozambique, the country to the
                    south of Tanzania. Nyerere was not physically involved in the sense of having an
                    army down there, but politically he was deeply involved in trying to resolve the
                    conflict between Michel, the then leader of Mozambique, and the forces that were
                    financed by South African interests who were trying to destabilize and overthrow
                    Michel.</p>
                <p>There was also the Namibia problem in which Nyerere was involved in as president
                    of the front line states. That became increasingly a problem on my plate.</p>
                <p>Angola, yes we became involved in that but more peripherally. And always looming
                    over the horizon was South Africa. Nyerere had black South African revolutionary
                    groups training in southern Tanzania and there was financial assistance to them,
                    etc. So in that part of the world there was a fair amount going on.</p>
                <p>In addition to all these external problems that the American Ambassador by virtue
                    of being the American Ambassador constantly became involved in the role of
                    advisor, hand holder, message deliver, and idea generator, we also had a major
                    involvement in the dreadful Tanzanian economy. There was a substantial AID
                    mission in Tanzania. We also had restarted a Peace Corps operation there. It was
                    my lot to wind down the major part of the AID effort primarily because I felt we
                    were simply wasting our money. I told Nyerere so, and told his Finance Minister
                    so, etc. So that did not make me a very popular figure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's deal with various parts of this. How about the
                        Zimbabwe thing? Was there much of a role to play or was it pretty much on
                        course at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: There were just a lot of bumps on the road, but there was no driving over
                    the cliff. In the final months of the negotiations, Nyerere became increasingly
                    helpful and less skeptical of the long term objectives of the Americans and the
                    British. Therefore he was more amenable to influencing his Zimbabwean brothers
                    to take more moderate positions on various aspects of the negotiations. I think
                    by the end we all gave Nyerere pretty solid marks for the role he had played. It
                    was a positive role. It was a beneficial role on the whole. In the earlier part
                    of the negotiations, I think Jim Spain had many more problems to deal with than
                    I did on Rhodesia.</p>

                    question of that. But because of that, there were aspects of the negotiations
                    and moments in the negotiations when the Americans were a much more acceptable
                    intermediary than were the British. More trusted, I think. We had no axe to

                <p>It is interesting that the current British Ambassador in Washington was the
                    principal Foreign Office staffer in the negotiation. The British Ambassador in
                    Dar es Salaam, or High Commissioner as he was called because Tanzania was in the
                    Commonwealth at that point, and I worked very closely on this issue. We traded
                    information and very often harmonized our demarches to Nyerere and reported to
                    one another on our conversations and reactions. I would not wish to characterize
                    which of us was the more effective with him. You can go talk to Julius about
                    that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, the Kenya thing I really took on as a personal project. I very often
                    got well out ahead of Washington which wasn't very interested in this problem.
                    For the record I don't want to suggest that I was violating any policy, but I
                    sure as hell was making policy in Dar es Salaam and not espousing
                    made-in-Washington policy in my discussions with the Kenyans and occasionally
                    their neighbors over how to resolve all this. I also was working very closely
                    with the World Bank representatives at that point trying to figure out ways to
                    alleviate tensions between the Kenyans and the Tanzanians. And we made quite a
                    lot of progress. By the time I left the major breakthrough hadn't occurred, but
                    things were pretty well set so that my successor was able to finish it off. Of
                    course, let's not forget that the Kenyans and Tanzanians themselves finally
                    settled things, but they were helped a lot by the Americans.</p>

                <p>VIETS: Surely the diplomatic history of the United States, especially in the last
                    15 years, I think will play that very theme over and over around the world. This
                    is possible because (1) we are what we are...a huge powerful giant of a country
                    with all kinds of resources at our command and (2) I think with some notable
                    exceptions, the quality of the chiefs of mission we had representing us were
                    people who had the intellectual capacity and experience to play this type of
                    role. We were not High Commissioners or Field Marshals. We worked by in large
                    very quietly behind the scenes. Often few people knew what we were up to,
                    sometimes not even people on our own staffs. Most of us, I think, were able to
                    develop, again not because of our scintillating personalities, but because we
                    represented what we did, most of us were able to develop very close
                    relationships with the head of state and principal advisors and play very
                    influential behind the scenes roles in the countries to which we were
                    accredited.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, the official diplomatic history of the United States probably will
                    not cover all this in the terms I am describing it because many times I know we
                    didn't report all that we were up to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This, of course, is one of the fun things about being in a
                        place such as Africa. What about the African Bureau? What was your
                        impression? This was not your bailiwick.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: With exception of the Rhodesian negotiations, which was very high on
                    Vance's list of priorities...during the last part of my tenure in Dar, Chester
                    Crocker had come on board as Assistant Secretary. By all odds he was one of the
                    most capable men I ever worked with. So superb leadership came out of the
                    Bureau. In general, our missions in Africa were staffed by very young,
                    relatively inexperienced diplomats. It was a training ground. I don't know
                    whether it still is, but it certainly was in those days. There were very few, it
                    seemed to me, at least in East Africa, trained, regional specialists. The
                    physical stress and strain on employees and their families was such that people
                    would do a tour in Africa and then usually rotate out into something less
                    damaging to livers and blood streams. There certainly were devoted Africanists,
                    but they couldn't be compared for the most part with the specialists you would
                    find in Asia or Eastern Europe, etc.</p>
                <p>I also felt that the competence level was not as high as what I had encountered
                    in other parts of the world. I had the impression the personnel people used
                    Africa as a dumping ground for people who were in the B and C+ category. I don't
                    wish to suggest that all our embassies were filled with B and C+ people. But the
                    average embassy in Africa that I saw, and I saw only a fraction of the total
                    number, never seemed to me to be up to what I had been accustomed to elsewhere
                    in the world. It was my first assignment in Africa below the Sahara Desert. I
                    had been in North Africa early on where we had a highly skilled staff, or so I
                    thought.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that you were comfortable doing things such
                        as trying to promote connections between Tanzania and Kenya, etc., without
                        over informing the Department? You didn't feel that anybody in Washington
                        would get their nose out of joint?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, the truth of the matter is that I got bored towards the end. When I
                    arrived, as I have said, there was this one burning, diplomatic negotiation
                    going on. So one had quite a lot to do. Secondly, there had been a long hiatus
                    of Charg�ship. Spain had left many months before for another assignment.
                    Frankly, the Embassy I inherited was a very sleepy and inefficiently run
                    operation, I thought. Remember I had just come from this big time Israeli
                    experience. I probably piled into the poor staff in Dar es Salaam with a little
                    more horsepower than needed. But by the time I left I thought we had a pretty
                    sparkling Embassy and I think the Department did too. But I always called that
                    assignment to Tanzania as my sabbatical. I had a couple of times been headed for
                    the War College and Senior Seminar and each time had been diverted off to
                    something else, so this was my year and a half away from the front lines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now to the AID business. Obviously the country doesn't
                        like you to yank AID out, but also even more important from an American
                        Ambassador's point of view, AID hates to go out. You are breaking a very
                        large rice bowl in one of the nicer countries to serve in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I don't want to get into the details of this even for the historical
                    record, but AID was rather poorly served in Dar es Salaam during the latter part
                    of my tour there, which was when I began to wind things down. So we had two
                    problems. We had very poor leadership, which ultimately ended up in legal
                    difficulty. Secondly, we had a Tanzanian government which was simply wasting
                    American taxpayers' money, in my judgment. We were involved in a great number of
                    peripheral programs that had grown up over the years and nobody had paid much
                    attention to them and we just kept pouring money and people into them. There
                    were various university contracts that had gone on well beyond the time when
                    they should have been terminated.</p>
                <p>It was I think the classic scene in the third world of time to pull things up by
                    the roots and either throw them over the fence and move on to other things or
                    close down. I might add that there were also some legal difficulties that arose
                    between the government of Tanzania and the United States government, namely that
                    the Tanzanians were frequently missing their debt payments and under public law
                    after a certain period disbursement of AID funds has to be frozen. So we had
                    that to contend with as well.</p>
                <p>My successor in Dar es Salaam was a political appointee, a young businessman who
                    had been working for an American multinational corporation in Nigeria. He had a
                    lot of business experience and I think he finished off what I started. I
                    understand today, however, we are back giving various types of assistance to
                    Tanzania. But I don't think it is of the magnitude that it was in the sixties
                    and seventies.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have this very strong impression that so many of these
                        AID projects were matters of bright ideas with very little follow through or
                        else they were not suited for the society but beneficial for the Ambassador,
                        the AID Administrator for living in the country. But the overall effects
                        were either nil or almost pernicious. Did you have this feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: A final point on this. As I earlier stated, the magnetism of Nyerere's
                    personality ...and he was an internationally known figure, he wasn't simply a
                    political figurehead in East Africa...he was highly respected outside of Dar es
                    Salaam, especially in Western Europe and particularly in Northern Europe in the
                    Scandinavian countries. He had a lot of supporters in the World Bank, less so in
                    IMF. But he managed over his career to bring into Dar es Salaam several billion
                    dollars in economic assistance. The United States government bilateral
                    contribution was a fraction of all that. So we, in fact, were quite small time
                    players, at least during my period as Ambassador there, in comparison to the
                    Swedes, the Danes, the Germans, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had Socialist connections.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Indeed he did. The point that I want to make was that I will go to my
                    grave gnashing my teeth over a mental picture I have of Swedish, Danish,
                    Norwegian, German aid employees spending every afternoon at the Dar es Salaam
                    Yacht Club sailing their yachts, scuba diving in those beautiful reefs, living
                    lives of considerable wealth and position, lives most of them I doubt could
                    undertake at home. They were paid enormous salaries, paid much better than their
                    American counterparts, and doing fairly well nothing in my judgment to earn
                    their salaries. It was just a dreadful picture of the worse of the excesses of
                    the donor world.</p>
                <p>I think the single most effective aid program that I ever encountered anywhere
                    was in Tanzania and that was conducted by the Dutch. The Dutch knew exactly what
                    they were doing and then got their money's worth. They were very generous in
                    terms of the size and scale of their economy, but then kept a very tight hold on
                    expenditures.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, it was a running sore of mismanagement, corruption,
                    incompetence, sloth, indolence on the part, I think, of most other aid
                    representatives. The Chinese learned their lesson faster than any of the rest of
                    us when they built the famous Tanzam railway in the 1950s between Zambia and Dar
                    es Salaam. They spent hundreds of millions of dollars on this project and before
                    it was finished it was already rusting and deteriorating with bridges washing
                    away, etc. The Chinese became very disillusioned with the capacity of the
                    Africans to absorb their hard earned assistance in an effective manner.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was at a time of great tension with the Soviet Union.
                        The Soviets had moved into Afghanistan to prop up a Communist government.
                        The Carter administration had done a tremendous flip flop because they had
                        been betrayed; the Brezhnev Doctrine was in full force, not allowing any
                        Communist country to change its form of government. Africa was considered by
                        many cold warriors to be probably the one open battle field... What was your
                        impression of this during the 1979-81 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: The Russians were minor players in Tanzania at least during my period
                    there. They had learned their lesson earlier on, that this was a kind of open
                    ended hole into which you tossed money and got really very little back in return
                    for your investment. They were, of course, supporting a number of revolutionary
                    groups operating on the periphery of Tanzania. They were active in Mozambique
                    and surely were supporting with arms and funds some of the South African
                    groups...SWAPO was one of their favorite beneficiaries. But Julius Nyerere had
                    by then I think pretty well concluded that the Soviets were not the best game in
                    town and while he maintained cordial enough relations with them, he didn't spend
                    a great deal of time worrying about enlarging his relationship with the
                    Soviets.The other Eastern European representatives who were in Dar, and they
                    were all there...remember this is a time when they were essentially taking
                    orders from Moscow...all had small aid programs and all were active. But you had
                    to ask yourself whether their governments realized these were peripheral role
                    operations at best. They probably would have done better to go elsewhere.</p>
                <p>The one burning issue which isn't related to the Russians that we haven't
                    mentioned occurred when our hostages were being held in Tehran. I can remember
                    demarche, after demarche, after demarche that I had to make either to Nyerere or
                    to the Foreign Minister for assistance with the Iranians on releasing these
                    hostages. I remember the last major demarche I made. Nyerere was off in Zanzibar
                    on a political tour and I was instructed to deliver this damn demarche within
                    two hours. I had to hire a plane and fly over there and insist on seeing
                    Nyerere. I interrupted some important discussion he was having with island
                    political leadership to deliver it. I remember he sort of quizzically looked at
                    me and I recall thinking “Oh God, Washington has once again kind of lost its
                    perspective on the importance of all this.” But he was helpful to a degree. He
                    didn't have any influence with Tehran to speak of, but he did maintain relations
                    with Iran and did send messages once or twice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At one point when we were issuing our human rights reports
                        and all, Nyerere was called a hypocrite. Human rights were big during the
                        Carter time and you were there during most of that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>VIETS: I do recall some strain on this issue. In particular there was some
                    discriminatory imprisonment and even torture, I think, of some of the
                    Indian-Pakistani community. As I remember there were several instances when some
                    of Nyerere's own political opposition found themselves in jail and there was
                    some question about mal- treatment, etc. But on the whole I think the Nyerere
                    regime's record is...in the human rights arena when one is talking about
                    imprisonment and torture, or loaded legal shenanigans against opposition, I
                    think his record is remarkably good. If human rights includes the right to a
                    job, an education, hospitalization, etc., then you have to give him pretty good
                    marks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about UN votes? Did you have to trot in and ask for
                        their vote in the UN?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I did quite a bit of that. In the final months of my tour the Foreign
                    Minister of Tanzania was a gentleman named Salam Salam, who nearly became the
                    Secretary General of the United Nations. I think he would have had it not been
                    for George Bush. Bush remembered Salam Salam as the Tanzanian delegate who came
                    and danced in front of his chair in the General Assembly the day the Chinese
                    were admitted to the United Nations. And Bush never forgot Mr. Salam Salam. I
                    found Salam Salam, who I think is now Secretary General of the OAU, to be a
                    very, very bright, interesting man whose revolutionary zeal had long since
                    cooled.</p>
                <p>But the Tanzanians were always a part of the third world nonaligned group. This
                    was a period when they didn't break ranks. One could bring all the rational
                    arguments you wanted to in making a demarche, but I don't ever remember turning
                    more than one or two votes.</p>

                <p>VIETS: We totally closed down there. I think Jim Spain had closed it down. After
                    I left one of my successors was Jock Shirley. He was a senior USIA career
                    officer who had a great interest in USIA activities. He reopened the USIA
                    installation in Zanzibar. During my time we had no one there. I used to go over,
                    of course, from time to time to meet with the leadership of the island and press
                    the flesh as it were. It is a fascinating island to visit, but a very sad scene.
                    The clove export market was still a major source of foreign exchange for the
                    Tanzanian government, but the Zanzibar government saw very little of it. It all
                    disappeared on the mainland.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>There I think Nyerere has to be judged by history. He treated the Zanzibareans as
                    second class citizens in the Tanzanian Commonwealth, as it were. There was a lot
                    of strain and tension between the two entities and I think it exists to this

                    Dick, could you tell me how you got your next assignment after Tanzania?</p>
                <p>VIETS: I think it fair to surmise that I had established some minor reputation
                    while I had been DCM in Israel with the seventh floor and the White House, and
                    also with Nick Veliotes who had been named as the new Assistant Secretary for
                    NEA. Nick and I had shared a very curious career pattern. I had succeeded him in
                    three or four jobs over the course of my Foreign Service career. I succeeded him
                    as political officer in India; I partially succeeded him in my only Departmental
                    assignment; I succeeded him as deputy chief of mission in Tel Aviv and succeeded
                    him as ambassador in Amman. This was sort of a diplomatic Siamese twin act. I
                    think Nick probably provided the final impetus to the decision to send me to
                    Jordan.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give us a little feel about it? In interviewing
                        people who served in Latin American affairs it was bloody when they came in.
                        But I don't think the same hostility was there in the Near Eastern
                        Bureau.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: No, I don't recall that there was any particular sense of that. NEA was
                    still felt by many to be the premier Bureau in the Department. There were a lot
                    of extremely talented, very experienced people in the Bureau at that time. It
                    subsequently, alas, has declined considerably. But at that time I certainly
                    don't recall slipping on anybody's blood.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>I am reminded of an amusing anecdote in connection with this transfer. You may
                    recall from other interviews that Ronald Reagan decided at the outset of his
                    administration that he personally would telephone every one of his ambassadorial
                    appointees. That was probably as close as he got to the substantive side of
                    foreign policy. One was always alerted that you could expect a call from the
                    President within the next 48 hours or whatever, and to make sure somebody always
                    knew how to reach you.</p>
                <p>Well, I got the usual call from Washington saying that everything was set and
                    that the President was going to be calling me in the next couple of days
                    offering this appointment to me. At that particular point, it was in the spring
                    of 1981, my wife was in a hospital in England. She had been at some kind of
                    charity fete down on the beach in Dar es Salaam and one of those tremendous
                    cyclones had blown up out of nowhere. She had been under a huge tent which
                    collapsed with the tent pole narrowly missing her head and pulverizing her leg.
                    So she had been evacuated to an Air Force hospital in England and I was alone in
                    my residence except for the presence of a very personable, interesting
                    Anglo-Indian lady who had been on my personal payroll for a number of years
                    taking care of my youngest daughter.</p>
                <p>Mary, as I say, was an Anglo-Indian who had seen a good bit of the world before I
                    ever knew her. She subsequently served in many posts with us. She often took
                    over the general management of whatever residence we were in, superseding the
                    government employees and was really almost part of the family. She was very
                    protective of all of us and particularly of me, She was especially effective in
                    handling importuning phone calls that always manage to get through to an
                    ambassador's residence.</p>
                <p>On this particular early evening I was taking a shower preparatory to going out
                    to dinner. I had been advised early that morning that the President would be
                    calling within the next couple of days. I failed to mention this to any staff in
                    the house. Unbeknownst to me while I was in the shower the telephone rang. Mary
                    picked up the telephone and an operator said, “This is the White House calling.
                    Is Ambassador Viets there?” “Yes, he is.” “Well, the President would like to
                    speak to him if you will put him on.” She apparently said, “Yes, she would get
                    me” and meanwhile for some reason the President, himself, came on the line and
                    said, “This is President Reagan speaking, am I speaking to Ambassador Viets?”
                    Mary roared back at him, “You bloody trickster, you joker, we don't take calls
                    like this here. Play your games with somebody else.” and slammed the telephone
                    down thinking this was just some local joker who was playing games with the
                    American Ambassador's phone number.</p>
                <p>About that time I emerged from the shower and Mary was standing in the hallway.
                    She said, “Some joker just telephoned claiming he was the President of the
                    United States and I hung up on him.” I said, “Oh Jesus, Mary.” Well, the phone
                    rang again and this very patient operator said, “Do we have the right number?”
                    And all went well. I subsequently told the President this story when I saw him
                    next in Washington and, of course, he got a great charge out of it. He said he
                    vividly remembered being told off by this woman.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give us a feel about when you came back, how you
                        prepared for the post, what you saw were the major problems and were there
                        any problems with Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: The confirmation procedure was very easy when it finally took place. I
                    recall it was a fairly long wait. Congress was on one of their summer holidays,
                    etc. I didn't get out to Amman until August, having come back to Washington in
                    late May.</p>
                <p>I knew, having gone through the process once and having assisted any number of
                    other ambassadors to go through a confirmation procedure, I knew pretty much how
                    I wanted to handle my own preparations. These included taking sort of a vacuum
                    cleaner approach to the city of Washington and calling on almost anybody who had
                    anything to do with Jordan, whether it was the Congress, the key agencies,
                    Defense, Commerce, etc. I made a number of trips around the country talking to
                    business executives who either had interests in Jordan or...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the American community, Jordan seems like a very poor
                        country, who would have an interest in the place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Petroleum companies have long been interested in Jordan and several,
                    indeed, have sunk significant amounts of money into exploration in Jordan. There
                    are a variety of lesser manufacturing joint ventures in Jordan...light industry.
                    For example, there were a number of projects relating to the exploitation of the
                    resources of the Dead Sea. It is very curious that as I talk to you this morning
                    I just got off the phone from a call to Jordan regarding a major joint venture
                    involving an American firm that I have been working on for the last months and
                    it looks as if it may finally come to fruition.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is there in the Dead Sea that excites
                        exploitation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, the brine of the Dead Sea has more minerals and chemicals in it than
                    any other body of water anywhere in the world. The particular project that I
                    just referred to is one relating to Bromine. Bromine additives are chemicals
                    that are used in fire retardant clothing and equipment. It is a very big, big
                    field and there are only three companies in the world who produce it in any
                    quantity. Two of them are American and the other is Israeli. Now, maybe we will
                    have a fourth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of Israeli. Did the Israeli lobby get in touch
                        with you before you went out? Jordan seems to be the one maneuvering
                        ground.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>VIETS: My recollection is that it worked both ways. A lot of these people I had
                    known for a number of years and worked with and I called on them. Others
                    contacted me. I think there was a strong sense that because I had recently spent
                    two years plus in Israel, separated only by what I call my sabbatical of a year
                    and a half, I was still fairly fresh off the griddle and knew a good many
                    Israelis and knew a great many members of the leadership of the “American-Jewish
                    Community.” So it was a natural thing to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you go out to Jordan, you are looking at it with an
                        experienced but fresh eye. What did you see as American interests in Jordan
                        and what did you see as your check list of things you would like to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: There was only one overwhelming objective that I had. That was to do
                    whatever I could to relieve some of the pressures of the Arab-Israeli
                    confrontation and ultimately, of course, to help move the parties into
                    negotiations. I do recall getting ready for this assignment. We had a new
                    Secretary of State, General Haig, and I remember that Al Haig did not have time
                    to meet his new ambassador to Jordan. This is perhaps understandable, although I
                    took it as not a particularly good omen.</p>
                <p>Haig already brought to his new role a pronounced bias favoring the state of
                    Israel. I remember within NEA there was growing apprehension as the weeks went
                    by and he was seen to be staffing his office with a number of people who were
                    very pro-Israeli. He would see every key Israeli who would flow into town, but
                    he did not make the same effort with the Arabs. So I remember worrying at the
                    time that this was going to be a problem of getting through to the Secretary. I
                    had been rather spoiled when I was in Israel because, of course, almost
                    everything you sent got on the Secretary's desk and the National Security
                    Advisor's desk and ultimately to the President's desk. And there were lots of
                    phone calls and visits. So you got to know these people personally very well.
                    Suddenly one found himself back to addressing the same issues, but from “across
                    the river” and yet unable to get to see the gentleman in charge. This didn't
                    bode well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling in NEA at that time that we had just
                        come from Secretary Vance and Secretary Muskie and moving to Secretary Haig,
                        that there was a difference in the way these Secretaries did this? Was the
                        perception that Haig was more inclined to listen to the Israeli side more
                        than either Vance or Muskie?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: That was the perception. How fair it was I am in no position to say. Nick
                    Veliotes would be in a much better position than I am to make that judgment
                    because he had to deal with Haig day in and day out.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>I finally did get to see Haig because I had gone up to some eighth floor
                    reception with Nick and there was Haig talking to a group of people. Nick, in
                    his best tradition, just grabbed me by the shoulder and propelled me forward and
                    pushed right through the crowd around Haig and said, “Mr. Secretary, we have
                    been trying to get to see you for days and here is Dick Viets who will be
                    leaving in three days for Amman and you damn well ought to talk to him.” Haig,
                    who I knew, but not well, said, “Oh, Dick, nobody told me.” We walked over to a
                    corner and talked for about five or six minutes. So I did have my brief moment
                    with the great man.</p>
                <p>I recall the night the news was flashed to Amman, and I guess I was listening to
                    the BBC 11 o'clock newscast and was all alone in my residence, my family were
                    away on a trip, and I heard that Secretary Haig had resigned or been fired. I
                    distinctly recall going out to the kitchen, pulling out a bottle of champagne
                    and uncorking it and consuming the entire bottle. I was greatly relieved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I heard from someone else that when the news came out in
                        the State Department that Veliotes ran down the hall saying, “Don't anyone
                        dare cheer. Keep at work.” It sounds like tremendous disloyalty, but it is
                        not. Attitude and the perception of attitude is important. It is very
                        disheartening to be in a post where you feel you are not going to get a fair
                        hearing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Now, what was the situation in Jordan when you arrived?</p>
                <p>VIETS: My timing couldn't have been worse because I arrived there two or three
                    days, I can't remember precisely, after the Israelis had bombed the famous Iraqi
                    nuclear reactor. The Middle East, as usual, was full of conspiracy theories, all
                    of which sooner or later connected the United States to the Israelis attack. I
                    arrived to find the Embassy in a state of siege, psychological siege. Nobody was
                    moving out to see anybody, talk to anybody. People were just hovering in their
                    offices feeling sorry for themselves. I remember realizing my first task was to
                    get this Embassy to get on it's bicycle and get on down to the bazaar and to
                    ministries, etc., and to begin to do its job. I think all of this was
                    exacerbated by the fact there had been a Charg� for about ten months. A long,
                    long haul for a Charg�. He had taken the view that the Charg�'s job is
                    essentially to maintain the status quo so far as the internal operation in the
                    Embassy is concerned. And that is a perfectly defensible thing to do. Perhaps he
                    would have taken a different view had he realized he was going to be running
                    things for ten months. But he didn't know that. He felt that the new Ambassador
                    ought to be able to change things as he wished. So I had the sense the first day
                    or so that I was in Amman that I was in kind of a haunted house or a summer
                    house that had been closed up all winter. But there was a group of very, very
                    good people at the Embassy who responded with alacrity to a little leadership
                    and we soon had the place humming with activity. I had great fun working with
                    this wonderful staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reaction to this Israeli bombing? I find
                        myself most of the time personally sort of annoyed or angry at what the
                        Israelis do, but this one I can't fault because subsequent events certainly
                        proved you had a real nasty person, Saddam Hussein, who might have used a
                        nuclear bomb.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: You have just reflected, of course, 20/20 hindsight. I think at the time,
                    not only in the Middle East but even here in Washington, even Al Haig, was very
                    concerned about the precedent that had been set where a national air force
                    crosses two sets of borders and bombs a strategic objective which it is
                    concerned about and returns home and expects the rest of the world to applaud.
                    The fact that it was a nuclear reactor didn't appreciably change the concern
                    that this was setting one hell of a bad precedent that needed to be responded to
                    in an appropriate fashion in the Security Council, which we did.</p>
                <p>Of course, in hindsight, as you just said, the history of the Middle East was
                    changed more than we realized at the time by that mission. The Arabs and I think
                    the Jordanians in particular were deeply concerned because they all felt, “Oh my
                    god, if they can do it to the Iraqis, they can do it to us.”</p>
                <p>Going back to my time in Israel, every three weeks or so the Israelis would fly
                    reconnaissance missions deep into Jordan and Saudi Arabia and Lebanon. They were
                    doing this essentially at will. Partly I think for psychological purposes and
                    partly to monitor air defenses, tracking capabilities, etc. in order to draw a
                    profile of the type of reaction you would get if you ever had to attack that
                    country.We would regularly go into the Ministry of Defense and the Ministry of
                    Foreign Affairs in Israel and warning against this practice.</p>
                <p>My first meeting with the King was the day after I arrived in Jordan when I
                    presented my credentials. That was, I think, a sign of the importance the King
                    placed on the Jordan-US relationship...within twenty-four hours of arrival you
                    present your credentials to the chief of state. It was probably also a
                    reflection of the tension of the moment. It was a good thing to get an American
                    Ambassador in place because people were damn well heated up over this
                    incursion.</p>
                <p>In my first conversation with the King he confided that in fact he personally had
                    spotted the Israeli aircraft on their way into Iraq. He had been up in an
                    aircraft of his own in southern Jordan, down near the Gulf of Aqaba, and had
                    spotted some miles away part of the squadron of Israeli F-16s on the way in. He
                    had a copilot with him and had said to him, “My God, I think they are on a
                    mission into Iraq.” He may have even said “after a reactor” because there had
                    been some concern this might happen.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>In any event he radioed the ground control staff to advise the air control center
                    in Amman that he had spotted X number of Israeli fighters at very low level,
                    which was part of the signal that this wasn't a reconnaissance mission. And he
                    instructed them to inform immediately the Iraqi Minister of Defense of the
                    sighting. Somehow there was confusion and the message never got to Amman air
                    control and thus was never passed to the Iraqis. So that is one of those little
                    ironic footnotes of history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did King Hussein ever imply to you or say to you that he
                        thought the United States was implicated in this, or was he savvy enough to
                        understand what this relationship between the United States and Israel was,
                        which was not a client/patron relationship by any means?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: He was much too sophisticated to make that allegation. He knew very well
                    Israeli concerns regarding Iraqi nuclear ambitions and he also knew Iraqi
                    concerns about Israeli nuclear capacity. But the street, the bazaar, I think,
                    saw it quite differently, and believed there had to have been collusion. And I
                    think to this day there are many people who believe that the US knowingly
                    provided the Israelis with satellite photos, etc, of this Iraqi target. My
                    recollection is that Mr. Pollard, the famous Israeli spy, did indeed provide
                    them with quite a bit of information relating to that Iraqi enterprise, but I
                    don't know the details of that.</p>

                    months or days or hours there is going to be a crisis. You just move from one
                    crisis to another. And you know these things heat up and become very passionate
                    and tense and then subside to be replaced by something new. So I understood that
                    this was today's crisis and one had to keep it in check...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Based on your time in Tel Aviv, your time before you went
                        out and arriving and talking to people in the Embassy, what was your mind
                        set of King Hussein?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: One must start by observing that the Israelis felt they knew Hussein much
                    better than any other Arab leader. They certainly had ample time to get to know
                    him over the years. They had a number of psychiatrists and psychologists and
                    strategists who were constantly updating profiles on him and on his immediate
                    advisors.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>But to answer your question, I felt quite confident that because of my time in
                    Israel I had a leg up, as it were, over almost anybody else in the area because
                    I had lived cheek by jaw with the Israelis and personally knew very well all of
                    the political leadership. Remember, Begin was still in power in 1981 and I knew
                    him and all of his principal cabinet people very well. I also knew the Israeli
                    military leadership very well. So I had this great advantage of being able to
                    sit down with the King, and often it was a daily meeting, sometimes twice a day,
                    and discuss with him in detail the personalities who were responsible for
                    whatever was going on that particular day. And believe me there are events that
                    transpired every day between the two countries that just don't get into the
                    newspapers for one reason or another. Each requires sitting back and taking a
                    deep breath and deciding what you are going to do about them, if anything.</p>
                <p>So throughout my period in Jordan I found it enormously beneficial to be able to
                    say, “Well, I think, your Majesty, this is being said or done for the following
                    reasons. Here is my analysis.” Our present ambassador in Jordan, Ambassador
                    Roger Harrison, two or three years before going to Jordan had served in Israel
                    as well as the political counselor, and I remember his saying to me that his
                    Israeli experience was extremely helpful for him. Of course, my immediate
                    predecessor, Nick Veliotes, had also been the DCM in Israel.</p>
                <p>So the three of us had this Israeli experience. I suppose if I were drawing up a
                    list of qualifications for ambassador to any of the so-called confrontation
                    countries with Israel, I would probably say that I think an assignment in Israel
                    was not only advantageous but perhaps even imperative. I felt the same way about
                    serving in Eastern Europe during the Cold War. You had to have been there to
                    understand the Cold War.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your assessment of what was driving the King?
                        Where did he want to come out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: One must first note that Jordan is blessed by having on its western border
                    a juggernaut of military and economic power, the superpower in the area.
                    Remember, Jordan has the longest border with Israel of any of its neighbors.
                    This border also has been the one most carefully policed and the one in which
                    the fewest incidents have taken place, since the end of the 1948 War.</p>
                <p>Then on the other eastern border are the Syrians, neighbors some would find not
                    the most pleasing of societies to have sitting at your back.</p>
                <p>On another border are the Iraqis, a colossus of a country with a tremendous
                    population, highly educated, the most industrialized country in the Middle East,
                    second greatest oil reserves of any country in the world, with a tremendous
                    military establishment.</p>
                <p>And then there are the Saudis on the southern front. And here you had tensions
                    between the royal families dating back to...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hashemites versus the Saudis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Yes, that is right. And on the far side, across the Gulf of Aqaba, are the
                    Egyptians. And there sits this tiny little Kingdom of Jordan with a small
                    population, almost no natural resources, that survives by its wits. Jordan has a
                    well-educated upper class. Many people in our aid agencies and in international
                    aid agencies think that Jordan stands among the first two or three countries in
                    the world over the years in its sensible use of foreign assistance. It was a
                    model for many, many years. A place where you got things done with minor
                    infusions of capital.</p>
                <p>Sitting astride all this is a man who became King while still a teenager. He has
                    lived through several wars and lost half of the territory that the kingdom
                    claimed, called the West Bank, after the 1967 War. He also lost direct Arab
                    access to Jerusalem, the third most holy place in the Islamic world. As a
                    descendant of the Prophet this probably has caused him greater pain than
                    anything else in his life.</p>
                <p>Over the years the King replaced Jordan's ties with the British, which, of
                    course, in the beginning were imposed ties, to a new focus on the United States.
                    For many years Jordan has viewed the United States as its principal protector
                    and benefactor and best friend. The King has dealt with every President since
                    Eisenhower. He may now be the longest reigning monarch in the world, if not, he
                    must be number two. So he has seen it all and dealt with everybody. The de
                    Gaulles, the Macmillans, the Khrushchevs, etc.</p>
                <p>I think he accepted long ago the reality of the state of Israel, that it wasn't
                    going to be blown away or pushed into the sea. He was always way ahead of all of
                    his compatriots and fellow leaders in the area. Shortly after the 1967 War he
                    initiated personal contact with Israeli political leaders. This is not the time
                    or the place to go into the details of this, but I will simply say that hundreds
                    of hours of conversation have taken place over the last 20 odd years.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>I think starting with the Johnson administration, the King became increasingly
                    concerned that for a variety of domestic political reasons as well as perhaps
                    for foreign policy reasons, the United States increasingly began to favor Israel
                    in its overall Middle Eastern political relationships. He was wise enough to
                    know there wasn't really very much that he could do about that, but it certainly
                    didn't preclude him from being deeply concerned by it. He also to this day
                    accepts the view that the United States continues, as it has from the beginning,
                    to hold the key to a final resolution of the confrontation between the Arab
                    world and the state of Israel. And I think one can fairly say the principal
                    policies that he has articulated over the years have been directed toward the
                    sole objective of encouraging a continued American involvement as the main
                    intermediary, or mediator, in the confrontation. He has not permitted his
                    unhappy perception of an increasing Washington bias in favor of Israel to cloud
                    the reality that Jordan and the other Arab nations need U.S. involvement as the
                    principal diplomatic catalyst in the search for a solution to the
                    confrontation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This brings up something. I have talked to other people
                        who have served in Jordan. You were saying that you would often see the King
                        once or twice a day. Obviously he had been through a number of ambassadors
                        and knew how to use them. He had his own staff so how was he using you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: We now get into very personal and sensitive areas and I think the only way
                    I want to answer this is that kings are no different than anybody else. They
                    need one or more people with whom they can sit alone and discuss issues openly
                    without fear of seeing it appear in the newspaper or being used by their
                    enemies. They need listening posts. They need people to use as sounding boards
                    for ideas. They need to share confidences. When they are down they need someone
                    to hold their hand and they need someone to share their exaltation when
                    something has gone right. Kings, I think, by the nature of the institution, are
                    often more isolated than presidents are. It is very difficult for a monarch to
                    know who his friend is and who is simply there to gain whatever advantage he can
                    from the relationship. In a democracy there are institutions and compensatory
                    balances, etc. in a system that winnow out much of that, but in a monarchy there
                    isn't.</p>

                    for purposes of this it is...all I can say is that one spent hundreds of hours
                    with this man discussing not just simply foreign policy differences and
                    problems, but the state of the world, the state of his own country, his
                    neighbors, family, etc.</p>

                        answer it. Here you are the paid representative of the United States. You
                        get into this and know that back in Washington anything dealing with Israel
                        leaks like hell. How did you feel on your reporting? You must have decided
                        what you would and would not report based on where it was going, etc. Can
                        you talk a little about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, you said it better than I can. I think that any ambassador who is
                    worth his salt must be able to develop a relationship with a head of government
                    or his cabinet ministers, in which there are conversations relating to the most
                    sensitive aspects of that person's personal life, private life or public life.
                    You have to make a decision about which part of this is important to policy
                    makers in your own government to know about, and which part of it simply goes to
                    the grave with you. I am sure that every ambassador who has developed those
                    sorts of relationships every night when he goes to bed has this on his mind.</p>
                <p>Of course there is highly selective reporting always going on. I don't think you
                    have that relationship very long if the reporting isn't selective because, as
                    you said, there are plenty of people who always find reasons to leak it.</p>
                <p>I have to say in defense of the institution of the State Department and the White
                    House, that there are very, very few instances of sensitive reporting I sent
                    home in which there was ever any blow back—or at least traceable blow back. We
                    had in those days, and I am sure it continues, some highly compartmented
                    reporting categories in which distribution was very, very limited, very few
                    people saw it. I have no complaints to make that people didn't honor their
                    commitments to this sensitivity.</p>

                        players?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: In the period that I was there, 1981-84, there were really three principal
                    players whom I saw very frequently...the King; the Crown Prince, his younger
                    brother; and the head of the military forces, a man by the name of Zaid bin
                    Shakir. He is now the Prime Minister. I had very little to do with Jordanian
                    prime ministers during this period. The King preferred that the channel of
                    communication be directly between him and me and the business that normally
                    would be done with the prime minister was accomplished with one of those three
                    men whom I just listed.</p>
                <p>Our present ambassador sees much more of the prime minister than he does the
                    King. So things change depending on who is the prime minister. And as democracy
                    has matured in Jordan, the prime minister takes on more and more power and there
                    is more and more need for the American Ambassador to deal with him. He also
                    deals much more with the parliament than I did. The parliament in my day was not
                    much more than a rubber stamp group. It was not an important segment of my
                    job.</p>

                <p>VIETS: Yes, there was a weakening of Begin's position at that time and Sharon was
                    certainly on the ascendancy. I felt, even while I was in Israel, that Sharon was
                    frankly a very dangerous figure. Dangerous for Israel and dangerous for his
                    neighbors, and perhaps even dangerous for the world. I felt even stronger as
                    time went on in Jordan and I watched Sharon's maneuvering as Defense Minister
                    and as I received intelligence information of what he was up too, I became very,
                    very concerned. I certainly imparted that sense of concern without imparting the
                    gory details to the King and to his immediate colleagues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sam Lewis was still in Tel Aviv. Did you feel you
                        understood what the action was in Israel, or because Alexander Haig was in
                        Washington and Sam Lewis had much more a direct line and you had this
                        affinity towards Israeli...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, remember Haig was gone within the year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the year was a very important year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Yeah. I am afraid my memory is a little dim on the specifics of what we
                    were going through at that time. My memory becomes sharper at the time George
                    Shultz picks up his role as Secretary and then ultimately launches the famous
                    Reagan plan in September, 1982. I will go to my grave thinking it is one of the
                    greater diplomatic triumphs of the post war era of American diplomacy.
                    Unfortunately, it foundered, but it was a triumph because it got through a very
                    biased bureaucracy and the President got behind it. We simply didn't follow
                    through on it as well as we might have for reasons we can discuss as we go
                    along. But it was a tremendously well-constructed diplomatic effort which had
                    great promise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My dates are getting hazy here. The really major event, of
                        course, was the Israeli invasion of Lebanon. That took place on Haig's
                        watch. In fact allegedly there was a wink or a nod when Sharon...When did
                        that happen</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>VIETS: That was in the early summer of 1982 because the peace initiative came in
                    September.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I was absolutely devastated by that invasion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were having an Israel which was saying that if anybody
                        does anything they will take threats. In other words it looked like this was
                        something, in hindsight, that was obviously a trumped up event...an
                        attempted assassination in London of the ambassador started this thing.
                        There was no cause and effect.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Sharon decided it was time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had our Embassy in Tel Aviv, in your analyses and
                        everybody else's who were looking at this thing, felt, “Oh my God, here is a
                        gun that is loaded and cocked and is going to go off?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I think there was no great secret that Sharon had been promoting the idea,
                    the concept, for quite some time. That sooner or later, preferably sooner from
                    his point of view, the Israelis had to go into Lebanon and once and for all take
                    care of the problem of the PLO operating inside Lebanon. And along the way to
                    remind the Syrians that the Israelis remained the boss of that part of the
                    world. I don't recall that there were any major intelligence indicators that the
                    invasion was going to take place up until immediately after the assassination
                    attempt, and then you began to see reports. The Israel military is as good or
                    better than anybody else at having contingency plans filed away in the safes of
                    their headquarters, and I am sure the Sharon plan in various incarnations had
                    been developed over the years and was ready and waiting. Sharon decided and
                    persuaded the Prime Minister and the cabinet that this was the excuse (the
                    abortive assassination) they needed.</p>
                <p>In fact, you may recall the principal argument for launching it was that Israel
                    had to neutralize the border; that the PLO would continue to threaten Israeli
                    border settlements with rocket attacks and the odd infiltration effort by
                    guerrillas. Over the years this had resulted in the deaths of innocent people
                    and children.</p>
                <p>In fact, Phil Habib had negotiated a year earlier, in Lebanon, a cease-fire along
                    that border and my recollection is that it had held to the letter. So Sharon's
                    “excuse” for launching the invasion because it was necessary to purge that
                    border of all these dangerous people who were throwing bombs over the wire
                    fences is pure baloney. The record simply doesn't sustain it.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>And secondly, as we now know, Sharon sold the Prime Minister and the cabinet on
                    the fact that this would be a very limited operation. He insisted he had no
                    intention of coming in contact with the Syrians and certainly had no intention
                    of going all the way to Beirut. In fact, he did. They did precisely that.</p>
                <p>I think for those of us who were out there it was a very, very bad moment of our
                    lives. God knows it was much worse for the people in Lebanon who were the
                    victims.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about how you felt when you got this
                        news?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: The first recollection that I have is a midnight phone call from the Queen
                    of Jordan, daughter of Najeeb Halaby, a distinguished American citizen. She just
                    stripped my skin off...”How can I serve a government which is doing anything to
                    stop this carnage and this terrible war?” I remember giving it right back to
                    her. Firstly, I thought she had no right personally to castigate me in this
                    form. And secondly, she was speaking from total ignorance about what I was doing
                    in trying to stop it.</p>
                <p>The King called me the next morning and asked that I come up to see him. He
                    closed the door and started laughing. He said he had been listening in on an
                    extension phone and had heard the whole conversation. I guess I should not go
                    into what he said about it. But it was not an easy time. There were
                    demonstrations against our Embassy and threats against our people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was sort of salami tactics in that...I have just
                        finished a long series of interviews with Bob Dillon where he notes that
                        Sharon and the Israelis were saying they were going up to such and such a
                        line and stop and actually we saw them 20 miles beyond that line. This went
                        on and on. Did this unfold gradually or did you immediately realize they
                        were going the whole way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: My recollection is that it was happening so fast that one was stunned by
                    the blatancy of the whole thing. It was as if there were no constraints, no
                    restrictions whatsoever, placed on that army. I can still recall those terrible
                    moments when the Israeli artillery units sat up on the hills overlooking Beirut
                    and 24 hours a day just lobbed shells and rockets into that city of totally
                    unprotected people.</p>
                <p>I think from a personal perspective it was even worse for me because I realized
                    what we were seeing at that point was in fact the first time that the most
                    modern technology of war, those horrible weapons of war that were not available
                    to the third world, were being used against defenseless populations. I was just
                    horrified by what I saw on television. It seemed to me that as these terrible
                    weapons became available to more and more armies and irresponsible governments
                    the world would be witness to carnage and devastation of heretofore unknown
                    dimension.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>This is a slight aside, but at this time I got into terrible difficulties on
                    Capitol Hill. I came home shortly after the end of the war. I was going back and
                    forth between Amman and Washington with considerable frequency in those days,
                    and whenever I did I always made a point, as many ambassadors do, of spending a
                    certain amount of time on Capitol Hill going around seeing key senators and
                    representatives and staffers, to brief them on what was going on, offer my own
                    views, etc.</p>
                <p>One of the people who I often went to see was Senator Rudy Boschwitz, now
                    defeated Senator from Minnesota, a Jewish member of the Senate who had a very
                    strong interest in the Middle East. While he was very pro-Israeli, he also
                    understood there certain aspects of our interests in the Middle East that even
                    transcended our/his affections of the state of Israel. I remember sitting in his
                    office, this was right at the end of the war, and saying to him that I thought
                    it was going to be a long, long time before those of us who had been witness to
                    all of this could forget the inhumanity of the Israeli army's attack on the city
                    of Beirut itself, which had absolutely no military significance whatsoever. I
                    remember Rudy Boschwitz rising out of his seat and putting his finger under my
                    nose saying, “You get out of this office. And you never cross the threshold of
                    this office again. I will never tolerate hearing any American Ambassador or any
                    representative of the United States government ever using the world “inhumane”
                    in connection with the state of Israel. Get out of here.”</p>
                <p>Well, I sat there and gave him back exactly what he had given me with a little
                    chapter and verse on the number of innocent casualties, men, women, children,
                    grandparents, etc., who had been killed and maimed, and then got up and left. I
                    have not seen him again to this day, but I know from others on the Hill that he
                    went around really doing a job on me concerning my perceived lack of loyalty to
                    Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time was there any thought of the Jordanians
                        jumping in or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: No. The last time the Jordanians jumped in (1967) was also the final time.
                    This war was an insane military operation and thank God everybody saw it for
                    what it was and did what they could to contain it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Syrians?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>VIETS: There was always the potential of this exploding into a regional war and
                    the potential had various scenarios inherent to it. You could have had an
                    uprising in Israel in the occupied territories in which large numbers of
                    settlers, for example, might have been killed and maimed. You could have had the
                    lost of American life and damage to American interests and installations in
                    countries on the periphery. We certainly were concerned about such an event in
                    Jordan, and so was the Jordanian government. I remember we had very heavy
                    security around our Embassy and staff housing units, provided by the Jordanian
                    government. That was true throughout the area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The two camps of Palestinians, Shatila and Sabra, men and
                        women were left and with the collusion of the Israelis, Christian militia
                        were allowed to go in there and it turned into a massacre. How did that play
                        in Jordan and what was our Embassy's reaction in Israel to this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: The press reports led to a feeling of abhorrence that this could happen
                    and led to all kinds of contrasts with Nazi atrocities during World War II, etc.
                    I'm being a little hesitant as I am responding to your question because my
                    recollection is that all we really had in the first days after this were press
                    reports. We really didn't have any inside information on exactly what had
                    happened. We knew something terrible had happened and while there might not have
                    been any doubt in the minds of people “in the streets” in the Arab world that
                    this was a direct result of Israeli collusion with Christian elements in Beirut,
                    I think most of us were a little reluctant to jump to that conclusion without
                    further evidence to support the fact. We simply didn't have it at that
                    point.</p>
                <p>My own view is that the total story of what went wrong has not yet been made
                    public to this day. I was told shortly thereafter that we had intercepted some
                    communications between Israeli units and the Phalange, which we deep-sixed
                    because we felt it would make the Israelis even more culpable than the Israelis'
                    own investigation suggested. But I have never heard the tapes and have never
                    seen them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to get a feel for the times, was this whole war on
                        daily TV in Jordan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Yes. It was the first war to use modern weaponry and to be covered with
                    such intense press interest. You remember, for its size the city of Jerusalem
                    has more journalists from all over the world than any other city in the world.
                    Wars attract journalists like flies. So there was tremendous coverage of that
                    war and nothing has seen its equivalent since.</p>

                        with Ambassador Richard N. Viets. Dick let's talk a little about the Shultz
                        plan.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>VIETS: I first became aware of what we call the Reagan Initiative in August of
                    1982. In fact, George Shultz was its principal architect, and I will always
                    believe this effort was one of George Shultz' finest hours, if not his finest
                    hour. Despite the fact that the plan never went anywhere, it had all the
                    elements that seemed to me at the time, and still does, to provide a fair and
                    durable end to the confrontation between the Arab world and the state of
                    Israel.</p>
                <p>I first heard of it when I was on holiday in England with my family. I had taken
                    a house for a month in the Cotswolds. We no sooner got settled in and had taken
                    our first amble through the Cotswold hills when I was informed by our governess
                    Mary Luke that our Embassy in London was trying urgently to reach me. I called
                    in and was told to come into London immediately because there was a secure line
                    call I had to make to Assistant Secretary Veliotes. Well, I sensed immediately
                    that that was the end of my holiday.</p>
                <p>I drove to the train station and went into London and got Nick on the phone. He
                    said, “I am going to make a very secret visit to Amman this weekend. I will be
                    arriving in London Saturday morning and the King is sending a special airplane
                    to pick me up and I want you to go with me. I will explain it all when I see
                    you. No one is to know we are in Amman except the King and the Prime Minister.
                    So do not advise your Embassy of this. We will not be staying at your residence,
                    etc., etc.”</p>

                <p>VIETS: This would have been in August, 1983. I think the plan was announced in
                    September.</p>
                <p>At the appointed hour I showed up at Heathrow. I remember taking a taxi to
                    Terminal 3 where we were to meet. I got out of the taxi and, my God, who was the
                    first person I should bump into but the administrative counselor of our Embassy
                    in Amman. He saw me with baggage and wanted to know right away whether I was
                    going back to Amman. I said, “No, no, I am going on a hot weekend to the south
                    of France.” I could just see the look on his face...”This son of a gun Viets has
                    some tootsie he is secretly meeting.” And, sure enough, he went back to Amman
                    with a big story that he had seen the Ambassador on his way to a weekend in the
                    south of France. So, it took some time to live that down.</p>
                <p>In any case, Nick and I joined forces at Heathrow and were flown out on a very
                    plush private jet belonging to His Majesty, and over champagne and smoked salmon
                    Nick first briefed me on the plan. That literally was the first I had heard of
                    it. I knew something had been going on that required certain people in NEA to
                    work very long hours, but I really did not know what was afoot.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>Nick's job, as Assistant Secretary, and as ex-Ambassador to Jordan, led the
                    Secretary to ask him to personally brief the King on the plan and to attempt to
                    secure the King's support of the plan. We had several sessions with the
                    King...we had a couple of days in Amman. On the whole the King subscribed to the
                    plan with alacrity. There were one or two questions he had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In essence, what was the initial plan proposing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: In essence it involved the US calling a conference of the confrontation
                    states with Israel based on the famous UN Resolutions 242 and 338 requiring
                    Israel to withdraw from the bulk of the occupied territories. It involved a
                    series of telescoped time steps leading to Israeli withdrawal and to elections,
                    etc. The final status of the territory that the Israelis withdrew from was to be
                    decided in negotiations to be concluded within 5 years. In the interim the
                    Palestinians were to establish and implement a self-governing authority.</p>
                <p>We took the stand that while the United States was against an independent state,
                    it would support whatever the parties themselves agreed to. In recent years we
                    have backed away from that second part. Now we are solidly against an
                    independent state—period. We no longer say that we will support whatever others
                    agree to. This is only one of many erosions of the Shultz policy that has taken
                    place in the last two administrations.</p>
                <p>In any case, Nick flew back to Washington and I flew back to England to pick up
                    my family and take them back to Amman. Obviously I had to be in Amman to follow
                    up those initial consultations with the King. The plan was announced and our
                    Ambassador in Israel, Sam Lewis, forecast very accurately when he learned of it,
                    that it would go nowhere with the Israelis because they had not been apprized
                    beforehand of it. They were not informed until just before the announcement of
                    the plan. They had no hand in developing the plan. For the Israelis this was the
                    first time in some years that they had not received notice over everybody else
                    of a U.S. policy initiative in the region. They had almost always managed, as a
                    result of having advance notice, to shape, to form and modify whatever the
                    policy the moment was to accommodate their own needs—or perceived needs.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>Begin immediately said no way to the Reagan initiative. He could see the
                    handwriting on the wall. This would mean ultimately getting out of most of his
                    beloved Judea and Samaria, and he wanted nothing to do with it. The Israelis put
                    up a tremendous public relations campaign against the initiative. They pulled
                    out all the stops in Israel and with their friends here in the halls of Congress
                    and with the American Jewish community. I think it is fair to say they plain
                    buffaloed the Reagan administration. The Administration got scared and in
                    consequence walked away from its own plan—a plan many of us considered to be by
                    all odds the fairest and most comprehensive, most balanced, most creative
                    diplomatic framework thus far conceived to resolve this long festering
                    confrontation. Those of us out in the field were left pretending that we still
                    backed it, but in fact there was no muscle put behind it. It just died almost
                    stillborn. It lived for a very short period of time.</p>
                <p>I believe in retrospect that this failure was a great shame. Look at what has
                    happened in the interim in the region in terms of the costs to human life in
                    Israel and amongst the Palestinians. The toll has been terrible, to say nothing
                    of the instability that continues to exist in the region because of the absence
                    of a settlement.</p>
                <p>Before we go any further, Stuart, I want to get on the record one of those
                    bizarre instances that rarely become a matter of public record, but in fact have
                    a very important bearing on relationships. In this instance I want to talk a
                    little about the personal relationship between Secretary of State Shultz and
                    King Hussein.</p>
                <p>About two or three months before Secretary Haig resigned and George Shultz was
                    appointed Secretary of State, George Shultz came to Amman with his wife on a
                    brief visit. He was at that time head of Bechtel. I remember he came with one of
                    the senior Bechtel vice presidents. He had known King Hussein in the past, I
                    think through Bechtel, which had done some work in Jordan over the years,
                    perhaps he had also known him in one of his earlier government positions. He
                    considered the King a friend.</p>
                <p>As I mentioned in one of our earlier taping sessions, George Shultz was number
                    one on my personal list of potential Secretaries of State. I recall he was
                    allegedly very disappointed when he wasn't named in the first Reagan cabinet in
                    place of General Haig. I had never met Mr. Shultz. When I heard he was in town I
                    immediately called him at his hotel and arranged to go over and to pay my
                    respects on him and to invite him to lunch. I spent quite a lot of time with him
                    and his wife. Of course the first thing I did was to inquire if there was
                    anything I could do to expedite his meeting with the King. He let me know
                    politely but firmly that he didn't need any help from me or anybody else. The
                    King knew he was in town and he was sure the phone was going to ring. His office
                    had sent advance word to the Palace of his impending visit.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>A couple of days went by and I was wining and dining the Shultzes and still no
                    word. I think he stayed in town three days and the phone never rang. He left
                    Amman in a major huff. He never heard from the King or from the royal palace. On
                    two or three occasions I said, “I am certain the King doesn't know you are here
                    because he is an enormously polite man and if he knew you were here I am sure
                    you would hear from him. Let me just call and find out.” Well, he didn't want me
                    to make any calls.</p>
                <p>As soon as he left I happened to see the King, who had been down during this
                    entire period at his palace in Aqaba for a long weekend with his family. I said
                    to him, “I think somebody has made a bad mistake. George Shultz was here and
                    spent three or four days waiting for word from the palace to call on you and he
                    never got any word. He left in a hell of a huff and his nose was really out of
                    joint. What happened?” He said, “George Shultz was here? Why in the hell didn't
                    anybody tell me?” Well, once again it was one of those dreadful instances when
                    staffs decide that the lord and master shouldn't be bothered with some
                    businessman.</p>
                <p>I always felt that this perceived slight negatively affected George Shultz'
                    future relationship with King Hussein. I honestly am trying to remember as I am
                    talking whether I ever told Shultz later when he became Secretary of State that
                    the King had never been told he was there. I must have, but I can't recall the
                    conversation. I do know that the relationship never was very warm. Shultz is a
                    man of great personal pride and dignity and ego and does not like to be
                    slighted, even by a king.</p>
                <p>I don't want to use this particular tape to cite chapter and verse as to why I
                    feel as strongly as I do on this, but it affected their relationship, that I am
                    convinced of. And that in turn affected some policy decisions with respect to
                    Jordan. As I said at the outset, this is one of those rinky dink things that
                    forms little pieces of history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is an interesting thing, you said this about Shultz. I
                        don't know the man and have never dealt with him and there hasn't been a
                        great deal of psychoanalysis of Shultz ...Alexander Haig gets all the
                        psychoanalysis of that period, but I have never heard this strong sense of
                        self with Shultz.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>VIETS: Very, very much so. In my view, and I am probably almost alone in this,
                    George Shultz in the first years as his time as Secretary State harbored, I
                    believe, ...and again I do not want to cite why, because it is and enormously
                    personal insight which affects somebody else...I think he harbored the hope that
                    somehow he might find himself as a presidential nominee at the end of the Reagan
                    administration. I believe he strongly felt there was no one else in the
                    government at that time who had the vast experience at cabinet level that he
                    had. And, of course, he was absolutely right. Treasury, Labor, OMB, Chairman of
                    a huge international contracting firm...he had done it all. A man of
                    considerable gifts. But a very substantial ego would be required, I guess, to
                    survive in the fast lane and do as well as he did. He also was a man of
                    considerable temper. You wanted to be very careful when you saw the color begin
                    to rise in his neck. He knew how to sound off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to the aftermath of the Israeli invasion of Lebanon.
                        When would this be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: The date would be summer of 1983.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it was essentially over in the fall of 1983?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Yes, I think so. I should have brushed up on the chronology of this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the exact chronology is not all that important. It
                        had happened, the Israelis were withdrawing, the Palestinians were getting
                        out...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, you remember they didn't get out for a long time and this was part
                    of the problem. As time went on the Israelis began to suffer increasing
                    casualties from truck bombs, car bombs, assassinations, etc. and life became
                    intolerable for the Israeli Defense Force (IDF) in Lebanon. They finally decided
                    they had had enough and got out. Of course it was about that time George Shultz
                    got on his horse and decided that he would negotiate the famous Israeli-Lebanese
                    peace treaty.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>I have one major recollection of that period. The Secretary flew out to Cairo
                    immediately prior to launching his shuttle diplomacy between Tel Aviv, Jerusalem
                    and Beirut to negotiate the treaty. Immediately prior to that he went to Cairo
                    where he summoned seven or eight of his ambassadors in the region, and I was one
                    of them. The reason for summons was he wanted our collective judgment on what
                    was needed in the treaty—and what was possible to attain. With the exception of
                    Sam Lewis, who was still our ambassador in Israel, the rest of us to a greater
                    or lesser extent told the Secretary—either very bluntly or very
                    diplomatically—that he was embarking on a useless and dangerous venture. We all
                    already knew essentially the dimensions of what he wanted in the treaty. His
                    primary goal was to normalize relationships between Lebanon and Israel. Most of
                    us believed it would be a big, big mistake to abandon what had been US policy
                    for many, many years, of seeking a comprehensive agreement. To negotiate
                    treaties piecemeal with Israel would surely guarantee an imbalance in the final
                    result—or so we thought. As we went around the table with these warnings, as I
                    say, one ambassador in particular, our ambassador to Syria, spoke to the
                    Secretary about as bluntly as anyone I have ever heard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Bob Paganelli.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Yes, Bob Paganelli, who if he has not been interviewed, should be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I want to get a hold of him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Bob almost was fired on the spot, I think. But in any case I could see the
                    color rising in the Secretary's neck and face as more of us spoke our pieces. He
                    didn't like it at all. At the end he just stood up and slapped his papers
                    together and abruptly observed that he guessed he had heard all he wanted from
                    us and stalked out of the room. I was subsequently told by a very close friend
                    who was working on the Secretary's staff that later that day Mr. Shultz had told
                    him he should have fired us all on the spot. In his view, all of us had been
                    bought out by the Arabs or we couldn't see the forest for the trees.</p>
                <p>Alas, the treaty that he ultimately negotiated was an appalling invasion of
                    Lebanese sovereignty. It included permitting the Israelis to build and maintain
                    monitoring stations on Mt. Hermon and to conduct over flights of Lebanon—and
                    many other kinds of fundamental infringements of Lebanese sovereignty. The
                    Lebanese ran for cover—the Syrians provided a good deal of that cover—and the
                    treaty blew up in George Shultz' face. Although none of us ever had the
                    effrontery to remind him, I think he got some pretty sound advise on that famous
                    day in Cairo.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dealing with your staff in Jordan. Here you are watching
                        what is happening every day on TV. From a practical point of view what the
                        Israelis were doing was pretty outrageous. They were bombing essentially an
                        open city. Lots of people were getting killed. It was not a justified
                        invasion. But at the same time Israel has a special close relationship with
                        us and you had served there. Did you find that you had to kind of damp down
                        the feelings and reporting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Yes. I had two problems as ambassador in that particular domain. One was
                    personal feelings. At various points during the three years I was there my staff
                    would get very excited, emotionally involved over various Israeli incursions
                    into Lebanon or over flights over Jordan, etc. I have to say that I think as in
                    any environment...I remember when I was posted in India I was there for two wars
                    with the Pakistanis. One picked up the Indian cudgels in no small measure,
                    particularly if one had no responsibility in the hierarchy of the Embassy it is
                    easy to become excessively involved in emotional terms. Certainly a number of
                    the younger staff people at the Embassy got pretty exercised over what they
                    perceived as immoral acts by the Israelis, if that is the right
                    characterization. But they became even more exercised over their own country's
                    policies on these matters, which they were certain were highly prejudiced in
                    favor of Israel. So one had constantly to attempt to control, tap down, that
                    feeling within the Embassy. And it pervaded the entire mission. It wasn't simply
                    the substantive officers who were involved.</p>
                <p>The other problem that went hand in hand with that was that a great deal of what
                    I was doing particularly with the King, was being reported in very restricted
                    cable channels. There was a paranoia in the Secretary's office that much of what
                    we were doing simply should not be shared with anybody. So I, as ambassador, had
                    another problem of trying to keep my Embassy generally informed about what was
                    going on and at the same time not revealing some of the more sensitive aspects
                    of it.</p>
                <p>I found this more difficult to deal with than I did the emotional side of things
                    because temperamentally I am one who takes the view that while I accept that
                    there is nothing wrong with embracing the concept of “need to know,” I tend to
                    give a broader interpretation of this than many of my colleagues did. I believe
                    you get more out of people and better performance out of people the more you
                    confide in them. You simply have to make a determination as to the degree of
                    trust that you can put in people and then let it go at that. I recall there were
                    many times in meetings with substantive officers when I told them things that
                    George Shultz and company would have been unhappy that I was revealing. But
                    nobody ever leaked it. These people were mature, disciplined officers and I felt
                    they should be treated as such.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there is also the problem too, that somebody might
                        speak out of turn if they don't know what is going on. Well, when did you
                        leave Jordan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I left Jordan in August, 1984.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any developments of the aftermath that we
                        haven't covered?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: No, I don't think so. We just kept drilling away at trying to find ways to
                    keep the diplomacy of the hour from being torpedoed by some foolish action by
                    one party or the other. You had, of course, during that period the Iran-Iraq war
                    which became an increasingly important part of my dialogue with the King. The
                    Jordanian role during the early eighties with the Iraqis was a very critical
                    one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Aqaba was the principal access port for everything going into and out of
                    Iraq. Kuwait and Saudi Arabia to a much lesser degree. Aqaba was the principal
                    port available to the Iraqis. During those years the Jordanian economy became
                    very closely tied to Iraq. And the King became a very close confidant of Saddam
                    Hussein. The King felt strongly that the war must not result in an Iranian
                    victory because of various geopolitical upheavals implicit in an Iranian
                    triumph. Islamic fundamentalism is not a creature of the nineties. It has been
                    around for some time and this was the King's principal nightmare. The King, more
                    than any other foreign leader, I think, was responsible for the reopening of a
                    dialogue during this period between the United States and Iraq. You remember
                    after the 1973 war Iraq broke diplomatic relations with the U.S. Kissinger
                    finally managed to get an interests office opened up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there was never very much contact.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: No, but through the King's good offices we were able to build up quite a
                    substantial presence in Baghdad. I think the King was very persuasive in the
                    issue of opening up an intelligence relationship with the Iraqis which became
                    very, very important in the prosecution of the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Satellite photography and that type of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were giving that information to the Iraqis to help

                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>VIETS: That is right. So that part of my job became very interesting and quite
                    important. Also in that period we worked very hard at trying to develop a
                    Jordanian rapid deployment force which could be used on a moment's notice
                    anywhere in the region. During that period the Jordanians had the best trained
                    special forces in the whole region, exclusive of the Israelis. We worked very
                    closely with them in training exercises, etc. and tried to get through the
                    Congress in the so-called black budget funding to establish a quick reaction
                    force.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the budget that does not appear or is covered in
                        other areas...a sort of hidden budget.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: ...funding for this force. Alas, the Israelis decided that it was a bad
                    idea and through their surrogates in the Congress, killed it. Again, if that
                    force had in fact been funded, I think there is a good possibility we would not
                    have had the famous Desert Storm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were talking about doing a special force, what
                        sort of eventualities were you looking at?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Everything from coup efforts to border incursions to mob scenes that local
                    government couldn't handle to outbreaks of regional strife. Remember, the Cold
                    War was going on at this point and there were plenty of people who felt the
                    Russians were manipulating forces in the area and looking for ways to
                    destabilize regimes, etc. How much of this in retrospect was real and how much
                    of this was a figment of our imagination...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was certainly how we were operating, particularly
                        in the Middle East because there it was very volatile. Talking about the
                        Iraq-Iran problem, although it had already happened by the time you had
                        arrived, did King Hussein ever question Saddam Hussein getting involved in
                        that mess?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: He may have, I simply don't remember it. By the time I got there the war
                    was in full swing. Saddam was taking a hell of a pounding from the Iranians.
                    There were tens of thousands of people being killed on both sides. It was a
                    carnage and the King simply wanted to get it over with. But he also wanted to
                    ensure Baghdad had won the war or at a minimum had left the battlefield with
                    Iran so severely mauled that it would not pose a future threat to the stability
                    of the area.</p>

                </p>
                <p>VIETS: In 1984.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you planning when you left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I came back and was told that I would be getting another embassy but it
                    would be at least a year before that happened. I was offered a range of things
                    to do. There were two things that I wanted to do: (1) I had not had an hour of
                    French language training and I wanted to improve my French, so I spent eight or
                    ten weeks working on my French fluency; (2) I wanted to do a stint on the Board
                    of Examiners which examines new candidates coming into the Service. I had felt
                    for many years that this was an obligation on the part of all senior officers of
                    any merit to go over to BEX for 3-4 months and to examine new entrants. From
                    personal experience I did not believe the quality of people serving on the Board
                    was very high.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a parking place. I speak as someone who served
                        there for a year as chairman of the consular cone.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, I did it and persuaded two or three other people to do it of my
                    vintage and class.</p>
                <p>Then I was offered our Embassy in Morocco. Just before that was to be announced
                    the immediate deputy of the then chief of protocol, Mrs. Walter Annenberg, got
                    her to go to Ronald Reagan and persuade him that he was the better candidate. So
                    he went to Morocco and I stayed home.</p>
                <p>I then worked for several months with a brilliant Foreign Service officer named
                    Charles Bray, who also was back and between assignments, and with two or three
                    other people on a major cost cutting program for the Department. At that point
                    we had been told that the Department's budget was going to be very severely
                    reduced in the coming year. So we did a vacuum cleaner type analysis of the
                    Department's budget, both domestic and foreign, and made a series of
                    recommendations to the Secretary.</p>
                <p>In the course of that, Mr. Shultz called me in one day and said he wanted me to
                    go to South Africa as our next Ambassador. There was a political appointee in
                    South Africa at the time who was doing everything to hang on as long as
                    possible, but the Administration had finally decided to get rid of him. I had
                    ten months to get ready. So I spent one of the more enjoyable ten months of my
                    career preparing for that assignment. Reading everything that I could, traveling
                    everywhere, seeing everyone I could. I got on the speaker circuit for the State
                    Department...this was 1986 when the Congress was giving the administration a
                    very tough time on its sanctions policy in South Africa. So I made a long series
                    of swings around the United States going as far as Alaska, speaking on behalf of
                    the Administration's South African policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>The day before my nomination was to go to the Hill at a meeting in the White
                    House on the sanctions bill (it was pending in the Senate and was to be voted on
                    in the next several days and the administration looked as if it were going to
                    lose), Don Regan, who was then the President's Chief of Staff, decided on the
                    spur of the moment that one way to defang opposition in the Senate would be to
                    send up the name of a black American to be our Ambassador to South Africa. He
                    thought this would take the wind out of the sails of the opposition. So I was
                    called in and informed literally the day before my name was to go into
                    nomination, that I wasn't going.</p>
                <p>But at the same moment the Secretary told me that I had been such a good soldier
                    (he was aware of the earlier Morocco fiasco), that he had talked to the
                    President about sending me to Lisbon. The President apparently had a personal
                    friend he intended to send to Portugal but the Secretary said the President
                    agreed that because of what I had been done for the Administration that I should
                    get first crack at the job. He said he had to have an answer in 24 hours.</p>
                <p>I decided even while he was offering the job that I should get out. It seemed to
                    me there was some message from on high here. I had really wanted to go to South
                    Africa and had poured a lot into it. I was personally very disappointed that
                    this had not come about. I felt I should get out while I was still young enough
                    to do a number of other things with my life. I was 56 at that point. But I said
                    I would discuss it with my wife and let him know the next day. I didn't tell him
                    what my personal inclination was.</p>
                <p>I took my wife to dinner that evening and told her and said that I thought I
                    should get out. She made it abundantly clear to me that I was not leaving, that
                    I would do this assignment, that I had spent most of my life preparing for
                    senior positions in the Foreign Service, that by my own admission the Service
                    had lost an awful lot of good people over the last several years and those of us
                    who were still around should stay around. I knew from the tone and tenor of her
                    remarks that I would be making a great mistake not to follow her advise!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your wife was a very powerful lady.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: In retrospect I wish I had followed my own advice because...I will not go
                    into it on this tape. But I said yes the next day to the Secretary and my name
                    was soon thereafter sent up in nomination. I started studying Portuguese and
                    getting ready. And then Senator Jesse Helms entered my life. For one solid year
                    he put a hold on my nomination. I think I am in the Guinness Book of Records. I
                    was voted out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to the floor three
                    separate times by huge margins. Each time my name got to the floor Senator Helms
                    put a hold on it.</p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>On the next to the last day of the Congressional session just before Christmas in
                    1987, George Shultz got into his car and went up to Capitol Hill and went in to
                    see the Senate majority leader, Senator Byrd, and said, “This is an outrage.
                    This is one of the best men we have. Etc., etc., etc. And we need him in
                    Portugal. I want him voted out before the Congress goes home and the session
                    ends.” Senator Byrd said, so I was subsequently told, “Mr. Secretary, all you
                    have to do is walk down that hall to office number such and such. Over the door
                    is the name Jesse Helms. All you need to do is to go in and say this to Jesse
                    and get him to lift that hold and I will have Mr. Viets name before the Senate
                    five minutes later.” The Secretary decided he would not see Mr. Helms and came
                    back to the Department. I was informed of this and it took me one second to
                    respond, “That's it, I am out.”</p>
                <p>I was asked to stay on. They thought something could be done in the next session,
                    but I said, No.” So I resigned/retired and that was the end of my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you go at all into Helms' motivation, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: Well, I am really reluctant to get very deeply into this for a number of
                    reasons, not the least being a very personal one that I have really locked the
                    door on that period of my life. He brought a huge number of charges against me.
                    Every single one of them was proven to be falsely based. But it brought terrible
                    pressure on my family. If, as one now reads in medical literature, stress is
                    related to cancer, then I have to say that I can thank Jesse Helms for the fact
                    that my wife within a month or so of my retirement was diagnosed as having
                    cancer and she died eight months later.</p>
                <p>The essence of the Helms position, I think...firstly he was really manipulated by
                    a member of his staff who had been in the Foreign Service and who either was
                    selected out or got out one step ahead of the sheriff. I have never known. I did
                    not know him in the Foreign Service. But this man had only one mission in life
                    and that was to do whatever he could to skewer the Foreign Service whether it
                    was in appropriation bills, or hearings on ambassadorial nominees, or what have
                    you. I think I represented for this staffer a great many things that he did not
                    like about the Foreign Service. Everything from the way I spoke, to the school I
                    went to, to the fact that I had been very, very lucky and risen very rapidly in
                    the ranks, etc. He developed for Helms' use a most extraordinary series of
                    charges which were based in every instance on issues that, fortunately, I was
                    able to disprove. But in the process an awful lot of dirty linen got washed
                    around town. There was a lot of unpleasantness and humiliation and it is a
                    chapter of my life that I have closed forever.</p>

                <p>I should add for the record because I think it answers better than anything I can
                    say about how the system works, towards the end of the year of being “held” by
                    Helms, I went to the White House to see Frank Carlucci, who at that time was the
                    President's National Security Advisor. Frank was an old friend and colleague. He
                    had been in Lisbon and spent a lot of time briefing me on the Portuguese and he
                    had introduced me to a lot of his Portuguese friends. He was very anxious that I
                    get to Portugal. He let me know that he would like to talk to me about trying to
                    break the Helms hold, so I went over to see him in his corner office there in
                    the White House. After our talk he walked over and picked up his telephone and
                    called Helms. He told him that I was sitting there in his office and we had had
                    a good talk and he really felt that enough was enough and Helms should lift his
                    hold, and he gave him some reasons why. Helms just very curtly said, “I am not
                    going to,” and hung up. Frank turned to me and told me what Helms had said and
                    said, “I guess that is it. We, unfortunately, need Helms more than we need
                    you.”</p>
                <p>It was said in a very nice way and I didn't blink at all. I understood it very
                    clearly. At this level in this world and in this type of game there are those
                    who are expendable and I clearly was one who was. Helms surely had a price and
                    Frank knew that. George Shultz knew that. The President knew that. But nobody
                    was prepared to pay his price. I understand that the most celebrated diplomat on
                    active duty in the Foreign Service, who is about to be nominated for perhaps the
                    most important post we have in the world today, has what is now known in the
                    State Department as a “Dick Viets problem” with Senator Helms and Helms has
                    sworn this man is not going anywhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Dick this sort of concludes this. Could you quickly
                        explain what you have been doing since?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>VIETS: I decided when I left that I had had enough of large organizations for a
                    while and that I wanted to take that barge trip in France when the new wines
                    came in, and I wanted to climb in the Himalayas, and I wanted to spend a lot of
                    time on my horses down in the country, and I wanted to do a lot of reading. I
                    also wanted to engage myself in what I call pro bono activities, Things I had
                    never been able to do in the Foreign Service because only two years of my entire
                    career were spent in Washington working—and one of those with Henry
                    Kissinger!</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>I knew that I wanted to stay involved in foreign affairs and I knew that our tax
                    laws are fundamentally written by and for American businessmen, so the first
                    thing I did when I retired was to set up a company. This has turned out to be
                    one of the smarter things I have ever done. In the interim I have remained very
                    active in Middle Eastern issues as a consultant to my old friend King Hussein.
                    There had been four or five years passage between my time as Ambassador and the
                    time I started doing this, so this arrangement met all the requirements of the
                    ethics laws. I continue to do consulting for some major multinational
                    corporations. I have joined the Boards of several groups and one or two
                    companies. I have become very active in the human rights field and am on the
                    Board of a major human rights lawyers group here in Washington...maybe the best
                    one in the country. I do quite a lot of traveling for them. I have also done
                    some election monitoring for both the National Democratic Institute and National
                    Republic Institute. I ride my horses and read books and stay very active in a
                    variety of things. I treasure those wonderful years in the Foreign Service. It
                    was a great ride! But to be free of a deadly bureaucracy and of the vanities and
                    incompetence of our political leadership, and to be able to do what one wants
                    when one wants to do it, to speak one's mind freely—this is the freedom that I
                    truly treasure.</p>
