                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is December 16, 2004. This is an interview with
                        Barbara H. Nielsen. It's being done on behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and Training and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Let's start
                        at the beginning. When and where were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I was born in Buffalo, New York outside of the city proper, July 8,
                    1949.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's get a little bit of background. Where did the
                        Nielsens come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Nielsen is my married name; my maiden name is Haven. My father's family
                    was from different parts of Pennsylvania. He grew up in Pittsburgh, as did my
                    mother. They moved to Buffalo before I was born.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your father doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: He worked in private industry as a quality control engineer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had he gone to university?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes, he was a graduate of Carnegie Tech in those days, now Carnegie
                    Mellon. He majored in math and didn't actually pursue a career in mathematics,
                    but that was what his degree was in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your mother's family name and where did they come
                        from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: They were from Pennsylvania. She was born in Pittsburgh and grew up
                    there. I don't recall what year, in fact, but she lived with her family in
                    Buffalo during the war certainly and I think they had moved up before then.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did she work or was she at home?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: She stayed at home for most of the time I was growing up and then went
                    to work part-time after I graduated from high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you grow up and spend your youth in Buffalo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: In Eggertsville, which is probably the closest suburb to the city of
                    Buffalo in the town of Amherst.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the town of Amherst like when you were a
                        kid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: It was very peaceful. This was the '50s. This particular suburb of the
                    city was probably 99% white ethnically. There was a good mix of various
                    ethnicities. Buffalo is a working class town, so people in the suburbs were
                    probably of a great variety of ethnic backgrounds. There weren't many recent
                    immigrants at that time. I think the city has welcomed a lot of immigrants since
                    then, but in the '50s, it was a very middle class enclave where we didn't grow
                    up with schoolmates who were African-American or Hispanic either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you enjoy school? What were your favorite
                        subjects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I always enjoyed school. I was an only child and so reading was a good
                    pastime for someone who didn't have a lot of social distractions at home. I
                    think certainly in the early years I enjoyed all subjects. Later it became clear
                    that I was going to be more of a liberal arts person than one interested in
                    science.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any of the early books that you read that
                        stick in your mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: In those early years, I read a lot of books, and enjoyed the Nancy Drew
                    series and biographies of women like Juliet Low, Anne Frank, and Helen
                    Keller.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: I went to Amherst Central, a public high school. Typical of its day, the
                    size was a school of about 1400 students, which today might be considered a
                    little bit small, but at that time it was sizeable. It was very reflective of
                    the geographic area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I graduated in 1967.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it would be '63 to '67. Did you get involved in any
                        particular activities in high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I was interested in languages. In those days, if you were going to study
                    an exotic language, it would be French. Today that would be considered not
                    exotic. So I studied French and Spanish. I was active in the French Honor
                    Society and the international club and I was interested in things international,
                    such as meeting exchange students. It was of interest to get to know them. At
                    one time, I thought I would like to be an exchange student. I didn't end up
                    doing that, but it was the kind of thing that was attractive to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much did the outside world intrude, reading papers,
                        news, that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Well, of course, it was the years of the Vietnam War and a lot was going
                    on in the early '60s. Civil rights were in the news. I was not politically
                    active or particularly involved in any of the movements of change. I say that
                    with some regret. I guess I should have been a little more cognizant of the big
                    issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it depended an awful lot on where you were and
                        circumstances. Being in the Buffalo area, how were the winters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Winters are notable. They start early and they end late and you have
                    plenty of snow. That was normal for me growing up. I didn't realize that there
                    were places that you didn't have to have snow on Thanksgiving. But sure, we were
                    not bothered by it. I think to this day, the city of Buffalo, to its credit,
                    knows how to remove snow. They get out there and take care of it. So, you have
                    very few snow days, fewer than here in Virginia, for example. The kids enjoy it.
                    It isn't an impediment to most things in life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was politics talked about at the table or was your family
                        interested in politics? Where did they fall if they were?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes. Looking back, we would probably... I've always been described as
                    “low key.” I guess much to my chagrin, I would love to be described as “vibrant”
                    and “outgoing,” but that's not really the case and I think my family is similar
                    in temperament and quiet, low key people, participating in politics but not
                    really taking a leadership role in local organizations. I'm sure my parents
                    voted regularly and had their preferences. They were probably Republican. But it
                    wasn't a big issue for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were at school, did the Cold War intrude at all?
                        Was this something you were looking at?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes. I was certainly aware of it. I can remember at one point writing to
                    the soviet embassy for information and receiving a copy of “Soviet Life,” the
                    equivalent to our USIA magazines. It was a source of interest. One of my French
                    teachers was of Ukrainian extraction. I can remember her being very adamant that
                    the Ukraine was a captive nation. Every year, she would be a part of the captive
                    nations celebration in downtown Buffalo. This was a reality, but it wasn't
                    something that impinged on my daily life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By '67, what were you pointed towards? Did you know where
                        you wanted to go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I thought I wanted to study languages. I went to Middlebury College and
                    majored in French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Middlebury is the place when you think of language
                        studies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Right, and that was true at the time. I came to realize that, of course,
                    what gave the college its premier reputation was the existence of the summer
                    schools. Those still thrive. They've added quite a number of languages since I
                    was there. As an undergraduate, you can certainly do very well majoring in
                    foreign languages, but the other departments would be probably equally as
                    strong. It's a good liberal arts college. I guess I studied primarily liberal
                    arts there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular area of liberal arts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Languages. I did French and Spanish and a little bit of German. I was
                    clearly interested in languages without necessarily having a concrete idea of
                    what I'd end up doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any foreign travel in during that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: I spent a junior year in France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you studying?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: We were based in Paris. The first month, I learned that the French
                    school year begins in November, not in September. So we had six weeks of
                    cultural studies in Biarritz, which was very pleasant. It gave us some insights
                    into another part of France that was very different from the urban Paris. One of
                    the striking things for a young American at that point was how the memory of the
                    war was still very fresh in people's minds. Okay, I can readily understand that
                    now. 1969 was only 25 years from the end of World War II. At the time, it seemed
                    very odd to me that people were still remembering that long ago war. The
                    pro-American sentiment was palpable and especially in places like Biarritz and
                    the smaller towns in the south of France, where I guess the American presence
                    had been a very positive thing. We were feted with the Vin d'Honneur, which as
                    teenagers we didn't particularly appreciate: neither the wine nor the function
                    perhaps, but it was something the French wanted to do to show their
                    gratitude.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: '69-'70.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the events of '68 still around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Fortunately, for our academic year, we didn't have any problem with the
                    fact that the previous year had been a lost year for French students. They
                    didn't have sufficient classes. If you were studying in the French system, you
                    would have lost a year. So, the spirit was very much alive. You could begin to
                    see changes in the educational system which were long overdue and a good thing.
                    From a pragmatic point of view, it was good to be away '69-'70 because that's
                    when our own campuses were very much disrupted in many areas of the country by
                    our own protests and demonstrations. Essentially I missed both of the protests,
                    but you could see the aftermath in France and then I came back to the aftermath
                    in the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you gathering from what you saw and heard later
                        when you were in France? What happened at Middlebury? How did it react to
                        the years of protests which were in the late '60s/early '70s?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: It was more low key than most colleges. Middlebury was still isolated.
                    ROTC existed on campus. People were not particularly opposed. I don't think they
                    easily recruited students, but there were some who chose to do that. They
                    weren't driven off by student protests. Today, there is no ROTC on Middlebury's
                    campus, so I don't know the evolution. I think it just became unpopular and so
                    the decision was made to drop it but probably not as an immediate consequence of
                    anti-war protests but rather kind of a gradual withering away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any idea of what you wanted to do when you
                        got out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I really didn't have any idea. I liked the idea of working
                    internationally and combining an interest in language and cultures. My first
                    thought was, okay, I could be a teacher. I did apply for the Fulbright program.
                    There is still now a teacher exchange at that level for students... Just
                    immediately after you finish college, you could be the equivalent of a teaching
                    assistant in France. I applied for that, but wasn't successful in the
                    competition, so I didn't end up teaching French until graduate school later on.
                    That was a very short-lived experience as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to graduate school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I did. From Middlebury, I went to Indiana University and got a degree in
                    library science, which was very nice. I had always enjoyed studying. I've had as
                    many opportunities as anyone could hope for and I've tried to take advantage of
                    them, but I must say that being a student from time to time is really a fun
                    thing to do. I've studied library science, which normally would lead to a career
                    somewhere in libraries. At the end of the day, I decided to join the Peace
                    Corps. I did work as a librarian for two years in Katmandu, Nepal under Peace
                    Corps auspices.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What brought you to the Peace Corps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Actually, while I was a student at Indiana, I applied for the Foreign
                    Service. I took the written exam. Then I took the oral exam. I have vague
                    recollections of that experience. Two things happened that day. George Wallace
                    was shot in Chicago. That's where I was. I did not pass the oral exam. I think
                    the interview panel was very kind and gently suggested that maybe a little bit
                    of experience would be good for me before I should try to join the Foreign
                    Service. So, that's what I did. The Peace Corps seemed like a good route and
                    exercised my interest and put some skills to use. I had hoped to go to West
                    Africa, francophone West Africa, but the government in its wisdom tends to send
                    you to some unlikely places and they decided to send me to Katmandu, Nepal,
                    which worked out fine. It wasn't on my radar screen at the time I got the
                    call.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: No, and I really was... There were many people who desperately wanted to
                    go to Nepal for its scenic beauty and its trekking possibilities. Most of the
                    people in my group would be considered in that category, but I and one other
                    womawe were only two women in the group of 5were not trekkers and we were
                    assigned to the capital.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Nepal from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I got there in December 1973. I stayed two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Until '75. What was the situation in Nepal at the time you
                        got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: It was very peaceful. The monarchy was very much in control. There were
                    some beginnings of disaffection with the monarchy and there was an opposition
                    struggling to make its voice heard but not very effectively at that time. The
                    Maoists that we read about today and for the last 10 years didn't exist. It was
                    certainly no threat to the government. Nepal was not a democracy and so
                    legitimate criticism could be made that their political system was shutting a
                    lot of people out. In any event, it was a peaceful monarch. The monarch was very
                    much in control. Political parties were pretty rudimentary and not very
                    influential.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of living conditions did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I was privileged in the capital. I rented a room with different
                    families, Nepalese initially, and then I rented a little apartment with a
                    Tibetan family. In that circumstance, I did have running water, which was quite
                    a big deal because you didn't have to go very far before people needed to haul
                    water from the stream. I had running water, though it was cold running water. We
                    didn't have heat either, but I was still very privileged materially. I didn't
                    have a kitchen, so I took my meals in a variety of eateries around town. They
                    were very cheap. You could eat copiously for nothing. You had to expect to be
                    sick a fair amount of the time, which was true, but you did recover. That was
                    the beauty of being young.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you learn Nepalese?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes, they speak Nepali, which bears some resemblance to Hindi. It's
                    Indo-European. If you trace Nepali back far enough, it's based on Sanskrit. They
                    use a Devanagari script just like Hindi, so once you can read Hindi, you can
                    read Nepali. It's a language spoken only in Nepal, so most of the Nepalese, when
                    they get some education, they learn both Hindi and English. Higher education is
                    conducted in English, just like Indian higher education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Nepal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I was the reference librarian at Tribhuvan University, which was the
                    only university in Nepal. I don't know what exists today. Maybe they have some
                    additional ones. It's a public university. It was a great privilege to go there.
                    At that time, the literacy rate was five to 10% and even less for girls. Someone
                    who had a secondary education and then was going to college was really an elite.
                    We dealt with the elite and they were modeling their system on U.S. models of
                    education. There was considerable input from USAID and other private NGOs. The
                    textbooks were in English. The Nepali collection would have been in Nepali or
                    other languages, but the undergraduate coursework that was conducted in English
                    was based on U.S. materials as well. So, reference service was not well known
                    and the idea was to establish it. That's what we worked on doing. The librarian
                    at the time, the library director, Shanti Mishra, and her husband were
                    U.S.-trained and they were pioneers in creating academic libraries in the
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the students, your contact with
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: They were very friendly, personable. They weren't accustomed to asking
                    questions, so you had a pedagogical role to bring them in and try to teach them
                    what a library could do for them and then help them get the materials they
                    needed. Also, the faculty was part of our target audience. They, too, would have
                    been trained in another system where probably the professor handed out the class
                    notes, the students memorized those notes, took exams, and there wasn't much
                    attempt to have them do independent research. The idea was to give them some
                    ideas about how they could improve their teaching, improve their research. We
                    worked a lot with the faculty in that field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much Indian influence from Indian
                        universities?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: Tremendous. Historically if you studied abroaand if you were going to
                    study at a university, you had to study abroawhere would you go? It would be
                    India. China is the other neighbor, of course, and the Chinese and the Indians
                    in traditional Nepalese politics were seen as powers to play one off against the
                    other. While the ties were much stronger with India, the Nepalese were certainly
                    flirting with the Chinese as well to make sure that it didn't become the colony
                    of India.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself in the position of an Indian
                        educated faculty kind of resentful of an American librarian?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Not really. At the time, the Nepalese were open to American assistance,
                    probably not universally, but by and large what I encountered was a receptivity
                    to things American. Young people were happy to have association with Peace Corps
                    volunteers. You were seen first as a Peace Corps volunteer and they thought this
                    was kind of fascinating because the concept was unusual. They recognized that
                    Americans were wealthy beyond their wildest dreams. In fact, they had
                    misperceptions about just how wealthy we were, but by any Nepalese standard, the
                    poorest American was very well-off. So, it intrigued them to think young
                    Americans were giving up something to come to Nepal. The volunteers generally
                    were idealistic, and came with pure motives. These were the early '70s and you
                    had primarily young volunteers without too much baggage and not a lot of
                    experience either. They were perceived as good kids who were there to help and
                    probably did have something to offer, so the welcome was quite genuine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your fellow Peace Corps people? Most of them
                        were out in the hinterland, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: They were. You measured your location by how many days walk from the
                    capitatwo days, three days, seven days if you were really remote. They had a lot
                    of challenges. It was much more difficult to be in the village where you were
                    the only foreigner, no one spoke English, you had to totally modify your diet
                    and your way of life to fit in. Most volunteers did that very successfully. A
                    few of them didn't succeed because of illness. It was easy to become ill. If you
                    were too ill, you couldn't remain out in the village. But most volunteers were
                    successful and kept that balance that you always have to be somewhat conscious
                    of. In spite of all your efforts to understand the culture, you're not going to
                    be Nepalese at the end of the day and you shouldn't expect to be. Most
                    volunteers managed quite well. A few of them went home early. But that wasn't
                    the majority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with our embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: Relatively little. On rare occasions, we would be invited. It was a nice
                    thing to be invited to the residence for real food. Carolyn Laise was the
                    ambassador at the time I was there. She was very gracious in hosting us. We had
                    ice cream, which was a treat. I think it was homemade with goat's milk, so it
                    was very rich, very delicious. It was definitely a treat. We also got to meet
                    Ellsworth Bunker, who came over for R&amp;R from Vietnam, I guess, to visit his
                    wife. He didn't tell us what was happening in Saigon. Otherwise, I really don't
                    remember going to the embassy. The USIS person there, Kent Obey, was also very
                    friendly and I did visit the American Center regularly because it had a
                    wonderful library. It was heavily used. The young Nepalese students packed it on
                    a daily basis. Having that experience encouraged me to pursue the Foreign
                    Service again. It was a very positive experience to see how our library program
                    was functioning and the number of Nepalese that were served. It seemed like a
                    very good resource that we were providing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think the normal Peace Corps volunteer would be somebody
                        who would have been opposed to the war in Vietnam. Did that permeate... Did
                        they keep that under control when they were abroad? In your training, did
                        you notice this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I think the group that I was with were a little more technocratic and
                    therefore their goal was not to protest the war in Vietnam. Their goal was to
                    use skills in forestry and agriculture and library science in a very direct
                    application. Perhaps it was the group that we had. They were not by and large
                    political science majors. They were people with some technical training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel this experience was for your library
                        skills?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: It probably did not put you on the cutting edge of library science, but
                    fortunately, when I went to library school, the Internet was not yet in
                    existence and technology was just beginning to be an important part of
                    information science. Today, that has changed totally. We were still book based
                    and print media based. In fact, we even learned cataloguing, which you don't
                    need to do any longer. There are, I guess, a very few who sit at a central
                    locale in Ohio and do cataloguing for the world. So my timing was good in the
                    sense that my library skills were fresh, they were applicable, and they were
                    still after two years not outdated when I came back to the U.S. As it turned
                    out, I didn't actually pursue a career in library science, but I have kept it as
                    an interest and it has been something I've worked with in the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: I probably got the date wrong. I finished my library science training in
                    '72. Then in December of '72, I went to Nepal. So I was there in '73 and '74 and
                    left November of '74 just short of two years. I gave myself a trip to Greece on
                    the way home, and Geneva, stopped off in a couple places along the way before
                    coming back here at the end of a year in '74.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in Nepal, were you observing the drug
                        culture? Nepal was one of the points where the young people, not just
                        Americans, but European and Australian and Japanese, had their wanderjahr.
                        Nepal was a big place to go in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes, it was. That was something of interest. We met a lot of the young
                    students or young people who came through Katmandu. They would often visit the
                    library. I did meet them in various places. Hashish was legal and there were tea
                    shops where you could go and have brownies laced with hash. The signs would be
                    freely advertising hashish and derivatives. Hard drugs weren't particularly in
                    vogue there. So this was the environment. But we were told quite categorically
                    that any drug use would result in our immediate departure, so that was something
                    to take into account. While using drugs could be legal in Nepal, it wasn't legal
                    once you were there under the aegis of the U.S. government, so it turned out not
                    to be an issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering whether you ran across, particularly young
                        Americans, who got there and sort of settled down to enjoy hashish and
                        became almost besotted with it and became protection and welfare cases. Was
                        there much of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Perhaps. It didn't come to my attention. Since I wasn't doing consular
                    work, it did not come to my attention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just wondering whether it intruded in your
                        life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: It didn't, and it didn't intrude in the Nepalese culture either.
                    Marijuana grows naturally there. I can recall, one of my language teachers, I
                    visited him at his house and there in the garden was some naturally growing
                    marijuana which was not used for anything. It just grew there like other plants.
                    So the Nepalese were not really big drug users themselves. I think the drug
                    problem became much more severe later in the '80s among the Nepalese as well. I
                    don't have much information, but apparently drugs were one of the reasons that
                    the Crown Prince killed his father and other members of his family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you make good friends with Nepalis? Was there much
                        social interaction?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes. The Nepalese are very hospitable and very friendly. They liked
                    Americans. It was relatively easy to get to know them. You got to know those
                    that you worked with best and those also who were Peace Corps staff or
                    associated with Peace Corps. I did make some friends along those lines and we
                    were always invited to weddings and family gatherings. I have to say, I haven't
                    actually kept up any of those ties. It was easy to get to know them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left there and took your time getting home and
                        seeing something of the world and Greece particularly, what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I did f a typical tourist trip in Athens. I was interested to see the
                    ancient monuments, the Parthenon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was '74?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't get into trouble?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: No. The military junta was in power at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was consul general there at the time. I don't recall
                        visiting you in prison.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: And a good thing, too. I think it was on that trip though that I did
                    visit the American embassy in Paris. Anyway, I stayed at a youth hostel in
                    Greece and I served there later as my last post. It amazed me to think that when
                    I visited there, I had no trouble not knowing the language. It was no big deal.
                    I often wondered why that was, because I was staying in a youth hostel and
                    eating in down scale restaurants..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There is a whole strata... They've been dealing with
                        tourists for centuries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: That's true. At that time, I also wanted to stop off in Geneva because I
                    was interested in UNESCO. I thought I'd apply to work there, which I did. While
                    I was there, I was going to look around and get a feel for Geneva. I also
                    stopped off in Paris, to visit the family that I had stayed with as a student. I
                    think that was the only time where I was careless enough to lose my wallet. That
                    allowed me to pay a visit to the embassy that I hadn't planned on and learned
                    first hand that, “Well, you know, we really can't help indigent Americans. You
                    can apply to your family and friends for money,” but I just went home.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went back to the U.S. This would have been
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: By then it's December of '74.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any plans for what you were going to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: No, I guess I didn't have good plans. I was going to see what the world
                    could do for me at that point. I should say, I was na�ve enough when I joined
                    the Peace Corps that I thought, well, the world wasn't beating a path to my
                    doorstep to offer me a particular job, so I would leave the country and join the
                    Peace Corps. When I returned, the world still wasn't making a path to my door to
                    offer me a fantastic job, so I decided that it was time to go back to school,
                    and I did. I went to the University of Buffalo. That was handy. I could live at
                    home. I studied French. I taught French as a graduate assistant. Then in the
                    fall of '75, I transferred to the graduate program at Yale, still in French,
                    thinking, “Well, I guess, I'll do a Ph.D. in French.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So did you pursue a Ph.D. in French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I did. But in the back of my mind was the idea that I still would like
                    to join the Foreign Service, so I took the exam. While I was in school, I did
                    the interview and then had to decide whether I wanted to join the Foreign
                    Service or to continue in graduate school. I determined that at the time, and I
                    got some advice about it, that the prospect of landing a tenure-track job in
                    French in 1976 wasn't all that rosy. A lot of people with Ph.D.s were driving
                    cabs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: French is a pretty... There is probably only one tenured
                        position in French at most schools.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Probably. The need wasn't critical. In terms of literary analysis, I
                    realized, since I was doing some of that, that it kind of had a negative effect
                    on me. I wasn't enamored of deconstruction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Deconstruction, this odious thing, started as a French
                        concoction.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: That's right, yes, and some of the greats were there at Yale. I took
                    classes from some of them, but I really didn't like it and I had the sense that
                    I enjoyed literature but they were destroying it with this methodology. So, I
                    was to some degree pushed by that to pursue something else and attracted at the
                    same time to the Foreign Service, which seemed to be a combination of theory and
                    practice. You're supposed to be thinking from time to time but you're also doing
                    and accomplishing things. You have programs that you run and so on.</p>

                <p>NIELSEN: Thankfully, no, I don't. I'm not even sure who was on the panel.
                    Foolishly, I guess I wasn't particularly nervous. It seemed like just another
                    conversation. It has probably become much more of a grueling exercise now than
                    it was then because A) it lasted less time and-</p>

                    '75.</p>

                    have to make a selection as you took the exam.</p>

                <p>NIELSEN: I might have. I probably wouldn't have enjoyed that, so all's well that

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So when did you come into the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I actually joined in May of 1976.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your entry class like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: There were 13 of us in USIA, evenly divided between men and women. I was
                    on the younger side. Our average age was 29. I was a bit younger than that. The
                    oldest member of our class was a high school teacher. I think he was 45 years
                    old. We all thought that was unusual. We had one woman in the class who had been
                    born in Cuba. That was interesting. Four individuals of the 13 were married to
                    one another in the class; i.e. we had two tandem couples. A couple of those 13
                    individuals didn't last more than about a year, probably the normal rate of
                    attrition as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any idea where you wanted to serve or what

                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I thought I would like to do cultural affairs in Paris. Why not?</p>

                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes. I was interested in using my French. I do recall that the bid list
                    did not have Paris. There were only two francophone positions. One was Kinshasa
                    and the other was Brussels. I think USIA in its wisdom didn't send me to either
                    one. The Brussels job was actually NATO. They probably didn't think I was an
                    especially good fit for NATO. I would agree with that at the time. As for
                    Kinshasa, I think someone was being kind to me in not sending me to Kinshasa. In
                    those days, too, rumor had it that single women often were sent to Latin America
                    because you didn't have to invest a lot in their language training and they
                    might get married shortly anyway. In keeping with that stereotype, I was sent to
                    Montevideo.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I got there in '77. It ended up being a 13 month assignment. I'm not
                    sure what the norm was. They kept changing that. For my predecessors, it was a
                    JOT assignment and you were either to stay on at post and go into a regular slot
                    or, if there wasn't one, then you would be moved after usually 18 months. But in
                    my case, they moved me after 13 months for whatever reason. I didn't actually
                    finish my rotation. I guess I should go back and do it. I was cheated out of my
                    consular rotation. I never did do consular affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about Uruguay. What was it like when you

                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: It was in the throes of the military regime. The Tupamaros were under
                    control by then. There was still some concern about those urban terrorists, but
                    they were largely subdued. At the same time, human rights were a problem between
                    our governments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jimmy Carter had just come in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes. We were making strong statements about support for human rights and
                    Uruguay was a place where you could feel that those statements were justified.
                    That was the work of the political section at that time. They were taking a lot
                    of complaints on behalf of individuals who thought that they had been tortured
                    or otherwise their human rights were abused.</p>
                <p>From the point of view of a cultural affairs officer, which was what I was doing,
                    it was a very fine place to be. We had a binational center there with a full
                    program of cultural events. Those were still the days when we brought cultural
                    groups to perform. We had a great library, one of the models in Latin America. I
                    was allowed to teach American literature in our program there. All in all, it
                    was a great place. The culture and society were... One thing that a military
                    regime does is create order, so it was very orderly. The Uruguayans tended to be
                    fairly subdued anyway. It was an easy place to live. The middle class was in
                    decline, but they still hung on to a decent standard of living. They were fine
                    counterparts.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes. I never met one. They weren't holding rallies or demonstrations or
                    doing anything at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On your side of the cultural work, did the opposition to
                        the military play any role? Were you getting protests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I don't remember any specific incidents. I suspect that there was a high
                    degree of control. We were not so far as I can recall a venue for the
                    opposition. I was there for a year, but I don't remember, for example, that we
                    were trying to help artists who wanted to protest against their government. I
                    don't think they were doing that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: In terms of what?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Our USIA function.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: We were running exchanges programs. My job was in large measure working
                    at the binational center where we were modeling modern library practices and
                    doing English teaching. Within the framework of English teaching, we were
                    teaching American culture. We actually had a certificate program so that
                    students could receive a qualification in American studies. That was one of our
                    big emphases, English teaching, librarianship, cultural events. I'm trying to
                    think of examples of what we had on the cultural events side. I think that was
                    where we had a dance troupe. We did bring musical groups and dance groups,
                    theater groups occasionally if they spoke Spanish. There was a big avant garde
                    troupe that we brought and which was very successful there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: Ernest Siracusa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was one of our major hands in Latin America.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: That's right. He was a motorcycle aficionado and old car aficionado. He
                    was the ambassador initially. Then Lawrence Pezzullo succeeded him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they have much interest in the USIS work there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: It probably wasn't their highest priority. The USIS program you could
                    say was traditional in the best sense. We were doing what we had always done,
                    the kind of program we should do and of course do have to justify periodically,
                    things like exchanges, the IV program...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The exchange and IV programs are so important. It's long
                        term, but they really work very well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: They do. They're hard to quantify. It doesn't always mean that someone
                    that you send on an IV becomes your friend, but it usually means they've learned
                    something. That's definitely helpful when you want to dialogue with them later
                    on. So, the program there was based on the traditional USIA offerings. It was
                    the beginning of the decline of resources for USIA back in '77. Budgets were
                    palpably being cut. Positions were being cut. We could see that 30 years later,
                    USIA disappears, so it was definitely on the downward slope even then in terms
                    of magnitude and personnel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the social life? How did you find the
                        Uruguayans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Uruguayans were unpretentious. They were easy to talk to, easy to make
                    friends with. They didn't have the arrogance of the Argentines, for example. I
                    liked the Uruguayans. Many years later, we had an Uruguayan babysitter for our
                    infant son when we lived in Arlington.. I think they're wonderful people. They
                    have all the warmth of Latins, but they're sensible, they're very middle class,
                    they're cultivated, they are warm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do they look to the United States rather than Europe for
                        study abroad?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: It's hard to generalize. In terms of where they would see their future,
                    yes, they were looking to the U.S. Granted, they had a cultural heritage from
                    Europe, Spain in particular. So their journalism, for example, was heavily
                    patterned after Spanish journalism. But studying English was very popular and
                    was viewed as a good way to advance your career especially if you were
                    interested in business or economics, liberal arts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned a baby. Did you acquire a significant other

                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I met my husband in Honduras.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this comes later on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: This comes after Uruguay. The Uruguayan babysitter was 1987.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After 13 months in Uruguay, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Tegucigalpa. It's going to be hard for the current generation to
                    understand this, but in those days a phone call from Washington was a big deal.
                    You kind of trembled whenever Washington was calling. By the way, Washington is
                    a very common first name in Uruguay. The Uruguayans had admiration for George
                    Washington. Even modern Uruguayans have given their children the name of
                    Washington as a first name. So there were quite a few of them on our staff. But
                    when Washington called, meaning headquarters, it was usually a cause for fear
                    and trembling. Thus, there was a fateful day when out of the blue Washington
                    called and told me I was going to Tegucigalpa in three weeks. My first question
                    had to be, “Well, where is that?” It turns out it's Honduras. It was a very nice
                    place as well. I had no role in the selection of my onward assignment and that
                    was normal in those days. You just got a call and off you went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Honduras from '78...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I arrived in February of '78. I was there until April of '81.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Honduras like? What was the political-economic
                        situation in '78?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: It, too, had a military regime. It used to change its military leader
                    with some frequency, but it did so peacefully. You'd have a bloodless coup and
                    wake up the next day with a new general in charge. Unlike Uruguay, the big
                    contrast was the level of education and development. Honduras was very much a
                    third world country whereas Uruguay was a second world country. Tegucigalpa was
                    much less economically developed. AID was a big part of our mission there. Peace
                    Corps was also a big part of the mission in Honduras. So, you were dealing on a
                    very different level. The director of the university had a BA and he was
                    considered highly educated. Anyone in that society who had a college degree
                    flaunted it. They would use the honorific “licenciado,” which means they
                    graduated from college. That was an accomplishment. That said, it was a rather
                    nice place to be a junior officer. You could be a somewhat bigger fish in a
                    small pond, have some budget that you would oversee and have control over, a
                    small staff that you would manage, and very easy access to the leaders of the
                    country — at least the leaders in the cultural and educational field, which is
                    what I was doing there. Of course, it was also a very hospitable place. Anywhere
                    you went, you were treated with distinction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any revolt or disturbances at that time out in
                        the hinterland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Not much. There was anti-American sentiment present. Central America has
                    a history of some negative feeling toward us. Honduras was the home of Standard
                    Fruit operations up on the coast. University students could be expected to have
                    some negative reaction to our policies at that time, both historically and
                    current policies. I was there during the Nicaraguan revolution which we
                    supported in a way, but we weren't thrilled with the Marxist regime that took
                    over from Somoza. But I was there only at the incipient stages of the
                    Contra-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Contra thing really got going somewhat later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: When I left in '81, we didn't have anything like the military presence
                    that we had later.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Who was the ambassador while you were there?</p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Mari-Luci Jaramillo. She was a very fine educator, “goodwill”
                    ambassador, a political appointee. It was still a time when you could have a
                    “goodwill” ambassador and that person could succeed and could carry out U.S.
                    policy quite adequately.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was her background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: She was a professor of education from New Mexico. Her husband
                    accompanied her, so that was something of an adjustment for him in a macho
                    society to be the husband of the ambassador, but I think she was very successful
                    and very well liked there. She was succeeded by Jack Binns. At that time, things
                    were becoming a little more difficult politically and he was brought in to take
                    a harder line with the Honduran government. I can't remember who the Honduran
                    president was at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They kept changing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: They kept changing. I can remember the first two generals, General
                    Melgar and then Policarpo Paz Garcia. Paz Garcia was notable because he was an
                    army general — I guess he had won fame in the very brief “soccer war” with El
                    Salvador — but he was not highly educated. In fact, he was a third grade
                    graduate, so you didn't look to him for great vision. During those years, El
                    Salvador was in some turmoil. It was not sufficiently safe to travel to San
                    Salvador, though you could travel to some other parts of the country..
                    Neighboring Guatemala was okay to travel to, but they were also having trouble
                    with civil unrest, such that Honduras was the peaceful country in the
                    region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of work were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Cultural work. I was the cultural attach� and there was no assistant, so
                    I did exchanges, English teaching, libraries, binational center, cultural
                    presentations. I also met my husband there. He was the English teaching fellow
                    who came down to work in the binational center.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is his background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: He did his studies in teaching English as a second language. He was a
                    freshly- minted graduate and USIA had this program for recent TOEFL graduates,
                    largely to staff binational centers in Latin America. We had two binational
                    centers, one in San Pedro Sula and one in Tegucigalpa and he was assigned to the
                    one in the capital.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it Honduras was a pretty poor country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Definitely. It really had no industry to speak of. I guess it still
                    doesn't. It relies on its agricultural production, coffee, bananas,
                    pineapple.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was coming to your binational centers? Were there good
                        target audiences? One thinks of some of those countries particularly at that
                        time and 10-12 families run the place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Unlike the polarization in El Salvador and in Nicaragua, Honduras didn't
                    suffer from that to the same degree. The ruling class, in the case of the
                    military, was composed of people who were not very wealthy, like General Paz
                    Garcia.. The generals were from the lower class. Overall, there were relatively
                    few wealthy Hondurans. The middle class did have some opportunities to get an
                    education and if they were professionals, they could live a decent middle class
                    existence, not so impressive by our current standards perhaps, but for the most
                    part you just didn't have this terrible disparity between the rich and the
                    poor.</p>
                <p>They had two political parties, which did not differ a great deal. You belonged
                    to the party that your family had belonged to for generations. They alternated
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Whites and the Blues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes, they were the Nacionales and the Colorados, but they weren't very
                    ideological. Generally, you were born into one or the other and you just kept
                    that affiliation. So, in that sense, they weren't ripe for civil war and they
                    didn't have an oligarchy. They have actually progressed to democracy now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any particular target groups? What about the
                        college students?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Sure, we worked with a lot with students, with young professionals as
                    well. The natural audience is always the young professional class, some of whom
                    had studied in the U.S. and others who wanted to study in the U.S., so the
                    Fulbright program was a big draw for those folks along with the short term
                    technical training that AID used to do. That was a real avenue for upward
                    mobility for enterprising Hondurans. If you worked with the Americans, there
                    would be opportunities to go to the U.S., get trained, and come back. Obviously
                    the universities were targets. We also worked a lot with the arts community.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: It wasn't part of my portfolio. I'm sure the political section was
                    charged with working with the military and we probably sent many of them for
                    training, but it wasn't a cultural issue. We always worked with the journalists
                    and our other traditional audiences. I remember trying to inculcate a better
                    sense of professionalism. The newspapers there tended to be sensationalistic and
                    tabloid in their approach, which meant that they would plaster the latest
                    traffic accident on the front page. The degree of professionalism was relatively
                    low. We were trying to remedy that and contribute to improvements in journalism.
                    We had a radio section and we used Voice of America radio programming quite a
                    bit there. It was still an environment where local stations needed programming
                    and could benefit by using some of ours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the social side, was it a hard society to break
                        into?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: They were very hospitable. There were a number of Americans who would
                    come to Honduras. The prototype is the American man marrying a Honduran woman.
                    That seems to work very well. Why is that? I guess Latin women are good wives,
                    if you will. The reverse doesn't tend to be the case. It tends to be very rare
                    for an American woman to marry a Honduran. It happens, of course. In part, it's
                    because, at least at that time, Honduras was a machistic society and educated
                    females were not universally appreciated. Education per se might not be viewed
                    so negatively, but assertive females wouldn't be appreciated. So while it's very
                    easy to have lots of Honduran friends, that's just one level of social
                    interaction; you didn't necessarily feel that these were going to be intimate
                    friends for life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I interviewed somebody somewhere in Central America that
                        said that at one point a good number of Americans settled along the
                        Caribbean coast and maybe got married, but they were older men who would get
                        younger wives and then they'd die. This became sort of a consular
                        problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes, okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They may not have been in the same social group that you
                        were in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: That's right. I can think of an example along those lines. Honduras
                    would be a cheap place to live and it would be an easy place to find a Honduran
                    wife or servant or whatever you wanted, so you could afford to do that. The
                    climate was good. I can see how the phenomenon might occur.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about United Fruit and the plantation owners? Did you
                        have much contact? How were you seeing that particular relationship
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: The American fruit companies had departed by the time I got there. Their
                    interests, they either liquidated them or they were in the hands of Hondurans.
                    There were still vestiges of United Fruit. You could see... I can recall
                    visiting a pineapple plantation and the houses for the workers had been built by
                    United Fruit. They created company towns in cities like La Ceiba, where if you
                    worked at United Fruit, you had a good job, you had a good standard of living.
                    You might not have had the freedom to unionize or have all the rights you might
                    want as a laborer, but it was a pretty good existence compared to that of a
                    laborer in a Honduran company. The presence of the American companies was no
                    longer an issue. Their legacy was something that you could debate.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is February 3, 2005. We're in 1981 and you are off
                        to Algeria. You served there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: For two years. I can't recall exactly what month we arrived in Algeria,
                    but we were there for roughly two years.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: CAO. There were two USIS officers. It was a small USIS operation and a
                    small embassy for that matter. At that time, we were still under some
                    limitations in terms of what we could do programwise.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: It was peaceful, relatively speaking. We were enjoying an “era of good
                    feelings” following the resolution of the hostage crisis. The Algerians had
                    played an important facilitative role in that. There was a bit of a
                    rapprochement between the two governments, not that they loved us, but at least
                    we had some areas that we could cooperate in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Michael Newlin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of things were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: In the public diplomacy realm, we were doing English teaching, American
                    studies. The Algerians were happy to have us bring our experts in to talk about
                    American literature and about English language teaching. They weren't very
                    interested in any of the other policy fields, American foreign policy or even
                    journalism. We had a very restricted program. We could send some Algerians to
                    the U.S. in the cultural field, university teaching, administration, library
                    science, but there were fairly marked constraints on what we could do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Algerian government like at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Suspicious of the West.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there lots of controls on their citizens?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes. It was a very difficult environment to get anything done for
                    foreigners and for Algerians, probably more difficult for Algerians actually.
                    There were strict controls on money. You couldn't get hard currency and yet if
                    you were going to travel outside the country, you needed to have access to hard
                    currency, so that was one area. If you wanted to establish a business or engage
                    in commerce, you had to have a lot of permissions. Housing was a big problem.
                    There was insufficient housing, so if you needed some, you had to know someone.
                    What most Algerians did was kind of make do with moving in with relatives,
                    doubling up with friends, but it was a rather harsh society for most people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've heard people say that the Algerians were not a very
                        open people.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes, that's right. For whatever historical reasoI'm not sure I ever
                    figured it outhey were suspicious of one another. They perhaps were no more or
                    no less suspicious of foreigners. They had some ideas of what foreigners were
                    like and they were as friendly to them as they were to their fellow Algerians,
                    and probably a little more so in many cases.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the French play any role there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Only as a legacy. French was still spoken and the educational system
                    owed a lot to the French. We employed in the embassy a great many third country
                    nationals, some of whom were French. There was a lot of back and forth with
                    France. Some people had French connections and there was a good deal of French
                    influence, but the Algerian government had made a big point to sever a lot of
                    its historical ties. They were Arabizing. The policy was to teach everyone
                    Arabic and to identify with the Arab world and to espouse the causes of their
                    fellow Arabs and to downplay any of their residual ties with the French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did teaching English cause a problem? Or as long as it
                        wasn't in French, it was considered a little more benign?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: The Algerians were very francophone and they saw that there was
                    something to be gained by teaching English. It was the language of technology
                    and they were a developing country. They saw their future being brighter if they
                    took advantage of science and technology, and English was a tool to further that
                    goal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of students were you getting to learn
                        English?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Young professionals, which was by design. We established at the time I
                    was there the first English teaching program in a long time under embassy
                    auspices. There had been a cultural center cum library which was closed at some
                    point and never reopened. In this vacuum, we did establish an English teaching
                    program on site, inviting the students into our compound there. The students we
                    recruited were professionals. We weren't targeting youth at that point but
                    rather young professionals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other cultural activitiefilms, art shows,
                        that sort of thing? Was this permitted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I'm not going to say it was forbidden, but there certainly were no large
                    groups that we sponsored. I don't remember any performing artists. That's not to
                    say there weren't a couple, but it was not a big deal for sure. We didn't have
                    the San Francisco Ballet or anything.</p>

                        Algeria? Now it's stopped everything out of that country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: They were beginning to be noticed. The government was aware of the
                    nascent organization of the fundamentalists and they were trying to keep them
                    under control. The violence hadn't begun, but people were aware that there were
                    some stirrings of unrest among Islamic fundamentalists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the Algerian press? Who was the
                        public affairs officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: The public affairs officer was first, Ed Penny and then, John Archibald.
                    I did not read Arabic, so I didn't read the Algerian press. From what I
                    understood - we had a local employee who made translations of the relevant
                    articles each day so we could keep tabs on the editorialthe press was largely
                    propagandistic. It's not a free press as we would think of one and therefore not
                    particularly worth reading either for most news.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the social life like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: My own experience was fine. I enjoyed the time that I spent there.
                    Virtually any country has something to offer if you're not planning to be there
                    for 10 years. You socialized with other embassy folks. We had a very good, small
                    Anglican church that we attended and had a number of activities that stemmed
                    from that group. The country has a lot of natural beauty, so if you traveled,
                    you could see things that you wouldn't see elsewhere. This was the first time
                    that I had visited the Sahara and the Roman ruins along the cost and some of the
                    really ancient citiefor example Constantine and Annaba, the birthplace of St.
                    Augustine. There really was a lot to study. I found that was just fine. My
                    successor also enjoyed her tour there. In her case, she was into sailing and a
                    number of people in the embassy did enjoy that, so if you had a boat or wanted
                    to be on the water, that was also possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any incidents or high level visits?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: There were no high level visits. I think relations were not sufficiently
                    strong or friendly. Today you might well have certainly more attention paid.
                    Travel wasn't as easy as it is now. But we didn't really have any high level
                    visits. The closest we came was, the Secretary of State came to neighboring
                    Morocco. I went over there to help. In Algeria itself we didn't even have
                    Marines. They weren't allowed in the country until the very end of the time I
                    was there. When we got our first contingent, it was a big deal.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any problem when Israel invaded Lebanon? This
                        was around '82 or so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: The massacre at the Sabra and Shatila refugee camps occurred during that
                    period, and it was a major source of criticism. The Algerians blamed us for
                    allowing that to happen. Of course, we were continually criticized for our
                    Israeli and Middle East policy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to develop Algerian friends?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes. You would call them professional friends as opposed to really close
                    personal friends. But there were a few people that you got to know on a personal
                    level. The Algerians are hospitable once you somehow establish a rapport with
                    them. There is a stereotype of Arab hospitality and they do practice it as well.
                    They're very generous and welcoming, but it did take some effort. Because of
                    limited supplies of many items, entertaining was quite difficult. Getting the
                    food that you might want was a struggle.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes, they produced a lot on their farms, but they became importers of
                    virtually everything except petroleum products. And there were shortages, so if
                    you were planning a meal, you had to have lots of contingency plans in the event
                    that you couldn't get eggs or you couldn't get cheese or you couldn't get
                    meat.</p>

                        really has gotten into the wrong hands and the wrong policies and is on a
                        downward trend rather than the reverse?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes, I think we felt that. Clearly they had natural resources and oil
                    wealth, which could have done a lot for their development. But they were inept.
                    They felt that they wanted to model themselves after the socialist economies and
                    societies of Eastern Europe, which, as we now know, was not the right model to
                    choose for a lot of reasons. They stifled the creativity of their own people and
                    drove many of them abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today, France is full of Algerians. Had that exodus been
                        in place while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: I think there were probably waves. Following independence, a lot of
                    “Pieds Noirs” returned to France. Those folks might have been in Algeria all
                    their life, but since they had the possibility to go back to France and were
                    culturally French, they chose to leave. The Algerians who studied in France and
                    studied in the U.S., too, in the '60s and '70s, many of them were enthusiastic
                    to come home and try and build their new society. Then, many of them became
                    aware that things were not developing in a very positive way and they would try
                    to leave. That would be the end of the '80s and '90s where you saw another
                    exodus and a very different group going to France in the '80s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the circles that you were working with, diplomats and
                        all, did they seem to keep their eye on what was happening in France? Was
                        that where the action was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: They certainly did, yes. They kept closely in touch with what was going
                    on in France. They were very interested in the U.S., too. The ones we met were
                    interested in the United States and its technology and its education system. I
                    don't recall, and I guess I wouldn't have dealt with the business community
                    particularly, so I'm not sure how they viewed us. Culturally though, they were
                    experimenting with their Arab roots and that made it important for them to
                    develop their ties with other Arab countries, with other third world countries
                    as well. They saw themselves as leaders in that sphere. The U.S. was not their
                    most important partner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about American movies and TV? Were they around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I'm sure they were. I never went to the cinema there. It was not
                    prohibited, but it wasn't terribly recommended. Women were made to feel
                    uncomfortable if they went. I couldn't tell you when they got recent movies. Of
                    course, they wouldn't have been in English necessarily. They might have been
                    dubbed into French with Arabic subtitles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in '83. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I went to Dakar, Senegal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must have been more fun.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes, it was a big breath of fresh air actually. Algeria was a dour
                    country, but the experience was valuable and it was certainly interesting to
                    experience Eastern Europe without being quite as heavy-handed as Romania,
                    Bulgaria, or the former Yugoslavia would have been, and the climate was a bit
                    better.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Senegal from '83 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: '86.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Senegal like when you arrived there in '83?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Struggling, unfortunately. Senegal had done a lot of things right. It
                    was a democracy. That's one thing that we want to give them full credit for.
                    They had a very tolerant body politic. They have a lot of different ethnic
                    groups, religious groups, which managed to tolerate and actually coexist rather
                    peacefully with each other. They have a couple different groups of Muslims.
                    They're not always fighting. They disagree about when the moon rises and when
                    the holidays fall, but they're not at each other's throats. Then, you have a
                    small Christian minority which had been rather influential, President Senghor
                    having been part of that. But again, there wasn't a lot of resentment of this
                    small group. Senegal had a very difficult economic situation. The desert was
                    fast encroaching and the livelihood of a lot of people was being wiped out by
                    desertification, so they really were not becoming less poor. It was difficult
                    for the country to maintain its economic standard. Instead, it appeared to be in
                    decline. After independence, the French left. While they left an infrastructure,
                    government offices and lots of buildings, universities, and so on, the country
                    wasn't wealthy enough to really maintain all of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your job was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I was the cultural officer. We had a cultural center and a library and a
                    reasonably important exchanges program, including Fulbright exchanges. We did
                    have cultural programs as well. USIS had gradually gotten out of the business of
                    big cultural events except in Europe. While we didn't bring orchestras and large
                    dance troupes, we did bring small jazz combos and sponsor art exhibits and
                    things along those lines, which were well received and were fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have an English program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes. The thrust there was expanding American studies, which was
                    something of a novelty because their tradition had been emphasizing ties with
                    France. But there was a new generation of teachers who were interested in
                    teaching about the United States, so this was fertile ground for training people
                    who would have some knowledge of America and American studies, which meant
                    history, culture, geography, literature, and language. Language wasn't the only
                    thing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Charles Bray.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the PAO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: There were two. I was there for three years. The first PAO was Will
                    Petty and the second PAO was Bob LaGamma.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm told the Senegalese are a delightful people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Oh, definitely. They are very warm and very friendly and very welcoming.
                    We got to know the Senegalese reasonably well. In spite of the economic distance
                    between many of them and American diplomats, you could feel comfortable. They
                    would invite you to their home and you could, of course, invite them. It's
                    typical of sub-Saharan African societies. They really are very person oriented
                    and people are quickly made to feel welcome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that you were in competition with the French
                        cultural side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I wouldn't say that, no. I think there was plenty of room for everyone
                    to be active there. It was a very nice experience, having been in Latin America,
                    then to go to Africa, where we had not really been involved in colonizing or
                    imperialism and didn't come in for a lot of criticism for any of those things.
                    We were kind of the new kids on the block and were largely welcomed in our
                    efforts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get out or did you mostly work around Dakar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: We didn't have a lot of program reason to travel. Outside of Dakar,
                    there wasn't much in the way of educational institutions. There were many more
                    in Algeria, with more decentralization. Dakar was still very much the
                    centralized capital in the way that Paris always was in France. For tourism, you
                    could certainly travel and we did do some of that, but not much for professional
                    reasons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were American TV and movies used there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Not so much, because of the language. American movies have traveled
                    everywhere and still do, but the Senegalese looked primarily to France for their
                    cultural stimulation.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes. He was very much an activist director. He had the ear of the
                    President and that resulted in resources for USIA, which is all to the good. He
                    did have his pet projects. You could credit him with the beginnings of WorldNet,
                    USIA TV, which personally I never thought was such a great medium, but it was an
                    attempt to be more modern than we had been. That was legitimate. It's just very
                    hard to make good TV serve government purposes. We were not into entertainment
                    TV.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No matter how you slice it, it's a talking head.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Really, yes. I actually don't mind some talking heads, but the WorldNet
                    programming was never very gripping. I'd rather read what they have to say than
                    watch them say it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have any problems when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Not really. You could get sick there, but I didn't. Our son, who was
                    born before we went to Senegal, was an infant there, which worked out well. He
                    did fine there. It's the kind of society which is very friendly to children, so
                    you get to know people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your husband doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: His field was teaching English as a foreign language, though he didn't
                    do that much of that, but because he was a trained teacher, he did teach. It was
                    the beginning of the computer era. The early '80s were a time of introduction to
                    word processing and the introduction of computers in our offices. He worked for
                    the embassy and did a lot of computer training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any major visits that you got roped into?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: The most interesting thing of that nature was not official visits, since
                    we did not receive any high level visitors that I can recall. President Clinton
                    went to Africa in the 90s, after a long period of no American president having
                    visited sub-Saharan Africa. However, when we were in Dakar, it was an alternate
                    landing site for the space shuttle. It may still be, although we're not sending
                    space shuttles these days. In any case, every time a space shuttle launched, we
                    did have some standby duties. I vividly remember the Challenger blowing up in
                    January of '86 because we were following the launch. But that was about the only
                    claim to fame of Dakar in terms of Washington visibility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After '86, you're off again. Back to Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes. You have to pay your dues. After 10 years overseas, it was time to
                    come back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were in Washington from '86 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: To '90.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I worked in the International Visitor Program for four years. I loved
                    the Program, which still continues under State, as well it should. It's really a
                    wonderful public diplomacy tool, one of the best resources that we have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've lived off that for years. I think it's one of our
                        most important diplomatic tools.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: It is. I think it is appreciated. It's not flashy and it's hard to say
                    exactly what effect it has on people because the effect is usually not immediate
                    and it's not usually broadcast. But the program continues. I spent four very
                    happy years, first in the Africa branch and then in the Latin American branch,
                    managing those two programs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have anything like the international visitors from
                        Hell?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes, there are always a few problems. That's inevitable. There was one
                    AfricaI can't recall which country he was from now, maybe Equatorial Guinea, who
                    never quite understood that he was supposed to go to appointments and that he
                    was supposed to have a professional program. He wanted to come and shop and
                    enjoy life with his wife and so on. That could be a problem. Other visitors were
                    quite demanding. We brought a group of Chilean supreme court justices with the
                    idea to give them a sense of an independent judiciary. We probably were not
                    successful in changing their minds very much. Nonetheless, the program was
                    successful in exposing them to other points of view, even if there was not
                    agreement on a lot of issues. These were folks who were also very demanding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes you have to have a group like that at the top
                        level so that you can start bringing the younger judges in. This opens the
                        way for the next generation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: That's right. Often the top dog won't let a subordinate travel unless
                    they've had the same opportunity. You sometimes need to start there. Of course,
                    symbolically, it makes sense to invite those who are influential or, conversely,
                    those who are going to be influential. Either one makes sense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Charlie Wick relate to this program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I never met Charlie Wick. He traveled a lot, but he did not travel to
                    the countries where I was, so I guess I don't really have any personal
                    anecdotes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you get to 1990, whither? Did you get out again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes. From Washington, I went to Chile.</p>

                <p>NIELSEN: From '90 to '94.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Chile when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: It was a very propitious era. Pinochet had been surprised to learn that
                    the Chileans really didn't want him to continue in power.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had had this famous referendum.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes, in 1989. He had been voted out and he had graciously accepted that.
                    By the time I got there, the first civilian in many years was the president,
                    President Alwin. He was a conciliator. He had the task of reestablishing a
                    democratic society and I think he did that very well. The U.S. was pleased with
                    the turn of events and so we paid much more attention to Chile than we might
                    have otherwise, and we did send lots of high level people, beginning with the
                    President. George H. W. Bush was there in 1990, the first American president
                    since Eisenhower in 1956. It was a big deal for the Chileans. They felt now they
                    were back as a member in good standing of the world community and the federation
                    of democratic nations. It was a good time to be there. We worked on a lot of
                    things with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were cultural affairs officer again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: This time I was the press officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Chilean press like? It was now a full
                        democracy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes, they needed to relearn a little what that meant. Of course, they
                    had been accustomed to self-censorship at the very least. They were able now to
                    be much more free in their reporting. They also at this time were beginning to
                    establish schools of journalism outside the traditional universities. There were
                    only a couple programs and they decided to create some new ones, quite a number
                    of them. We were helping them with that. They had a system of licensing, a law
                    that required journalists to be licensed. We were not of the view that that was
                    a good idea, so we tried to persuade them otherwise. Although journalism as a
                    whole was rather timid, there were and still are plenty of media outlets. The
                    paper of record is El Mercurio, a family-owned enterprise; it was highly
                    respected, and it still continues to play that role. Somewhat surprisingly,
                    radio is still a very important medium, not so much because of the very long
                    commute times that we have, but rather because of the geography of the country.
                    Chile's considerable length is conducive to communication by radio.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about TV?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: TV was in its infancy. Of course, they had had TV since the '60s, too,
                    but it was still very much under development. I visited there recently. Now,
                    Chilean television is as proficient technically as anywhere. But at that time,
                    in the early 90s, they introduced the first private TV station. That was
                    something new. I guess you could still say television is fairly conservative and
                    fairly timid by our standards, which is not such a bad thing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they looking at us and asking to go to the United
                        States to learn how to redo things or getting people to come from the United
                        States to get their apparatus restarted again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes. From the academic community, there were already lots of ties and
                    those were exploited in order to jump-start some of their legal institutions,
                    schools of law, and of course their economic policy. Their economic policy had
                    always been quite influenced by the U.S., as a result of the famous “Chicago
                    Boys” (Chileans who had studied in the U.S.), who were responsible for
                    Pinochet's economic policies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much residue of unhappiness with the United
                        States over the events of '73, when Pinochet took power? We've been accused
                        of being behind it. This is kind of dubious, but at the same time, we
                        weren't opposing the overthrow of Allende.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: It's true, we weren't opposing his overthrow. Quite a bit can now be
                    known factually because the State Department's “Chile project” put the
                    declassified cables from that period online and it is freely available. I
                    haven't read all those cables to know just what the naval attach� in Valparaiso
                    knew and when he knew it, so I can't answer the question of what we did exactly.
                    Of course, the accusation from the left was that the U.S. had a leading role in
                    overthrowing Allende. The left threw around a lot of accusations which were not
                    true, one of which was that Allende was killed, but actually, he killed himself.
                    We didn't have anything to do with it. The Church Commission did its
                    investigation. This was Senator Church. I haven't looked at that in a long time
                    to know what was factual and what was conjecture. Chileans who supported the
                    coup, and there were many, did not object to U.S. actions. The hard-core
                    supporters of Allende continued to be generally anti-U.S. for many reasons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By 1990-'94, was there much carryover? Did you find people
                        fell into these various camps or was that just past history?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: The history was still alive, maybe not surprisingly so, since 15 years
                    wasn't all that long. However, I did not usually encounter people who had been
                    either tortured or who had relatives who had disappeared.</p>
                <p>I would sometimes meet folks in the government who were victims of the Pinochet
                    regime and they did not seem to be rabid ideologues. They seemed to have really
                    gone beyond that. At least in their day to day interactions with us, they were
                    cordial and productive. Obviously the subject hasn't been fully closed. During
                    the time that I was there, the 1976 Letelier murder case was still an important
                    hot topic. We were trying to bring to justice those who had been
                    responsible.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some were in the United States. There were Americans
                        involved as well as members of Pinochet's secret police.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: That's right. Michael Townley, an American, worked with Pinochet's
                    secret police, the DINA, to carry out this assassination. Then he went into the
                    Witness Protection Program. Meanwhile, we were trying to establish the record
                    and then bring to justice some members of the intelligence service who could be
                    considered responsible. That didn't happen until some years later. I had left
                    Chile by then. But it has happened now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Letelier case was the bombing assassination of a
                        former foreign minister and his American assistant. They were both killed on
                        Sheridan Circle in a remote controlled bombing in their car.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: That's right, September 1976. They were riding to work and the bomb
                    exploded and Orlando Letelier was killed along with his assistant, Ronni Moffet.
                    Michael Moffet, her husband, was in the car as well, but he survived. The United
                    States, of course, noted that this was really the first act of terrorism on our
                    soil in many hundreds of years. It was something we took very seriously and we
                    pursued.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It took years and years because there were people in the
                        Pinochet government, very high officials, who were involved.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes, definitely. General Manuel Contreras is credited with being the
                    intellectual author of that crime. He has not admitted it, but he's been charged
                    with that and other crimes. He's under house arrest these days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when President Bush came?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes, that was our big moment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: As the press attach�, I was at the airport putting down the tape to
                    indicate where the nose of the plane should rest and setting up a flatbed truck
                    for the press to file from, installing phone lines and things like that so that
                    the American press was able to cover this event and the Chilean press likewise.
                    It was a very big symbolic moment because presidential visits were infrequent
                    and in the case of Chile, it had been a good long time since the President came.
                    Just the fact that he came, almost regardless of what he said, was significant.
                    That began a string of other high-level visits as well. And lest we forget,
                    presidential visits, complicated though they were then, were nothing like what
                    they are now in terms of how many people are involveit was relatively few who
                    were making decisions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else we should cover about Chile?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: To continue the train of thought that President Bush's visit in
                    December, 1990 did mark a return to normalcy, to signal that, we sent our
                    Secretary of Defense, who is now the Vice President, Richard Cheney. Up until
                    that time, we had very little or no military cooperation with Chile because we
                    didn't feel that their human rights record was very positive. So, again, we were
                    able to reestablish our military ties and began cooperation in the military
                    field. That was also quite important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't they send a ship or two to the Persian Gulf during
                        Desert Storm?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I can't recall. That war took place while I was there. Colin Powell also
                    visited in his capacity as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs. That was an important
                    visit as well because it signaled change in the Chilean military, with the next
                    generation much more mindful of human rights than the previous generation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have you leaving there in '94. Let's pick this up the
                        next time. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I came back to Washington for language training and then on to
                    Sweden.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is February 10, 2005. In '94, you're taking
                        Swedish.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes. One of those lovely one-country languages.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I cant remember, how Swedish is Nielsen? Did you have a

                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: N-I-E-L-S-O-N would be the Swedish spelling of Nielsen. The Danish
                    spelling is N-I-E-L-S-E-N, which is my last name. It's a name I married into, so
                    I can't claim any personal affiliation, but certainly all the folks in
                    Scandinavia are descended from the same stock, and at least my husband can trace
                    his roots to Norway and Denmark.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: From '94 to '98.</p>

                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I was the public affairs officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador when you went there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Thomas Siebert.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's his background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: He was a classmate of Bill Clinton at Georgetown and was a lawyer and
                    businessperson who worked in the area of telecommunications. His specialty was
                    telecommunications law. He was an early supporter of Bill Clinton and a friend
                    personally from school, so that was how he ended up in Sweden.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did he bring to the job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: He had a very keen sense of politics, which is not unexpected, but I
                    thought he did a good job of explaining the Clinton presidency. Sweden was the
                    kind of place where you would often be asked to do public speaking. I worked
                    with him quite a bit on many of his speeches. Some of them were focused on
                    economics and business. That was one of our policy interests, to explain how the
                    American economic system was constructed and functioned. We were at that moment
                    very proud of our entrepreneurial achievements, our stock market achievements,
                    our innovation in technology and information technology. The Swedes were
                    interested in that, and the Ambassador was a good spokesman on those things.
                    Also, what impressed me a lot was how he would encapsulate American politics. He
                    knew a lot about partisan politics, but also what effect the charisma of someone
                    like Bill Clinton or Ronald Reagan had and how you accounted for that. He was
                    very effective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived there in '94, what was the status of
                        Swedish-American relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Relations were good. Eastern Europe had just had its seismic shift and
                    the countries of Eastern Europe were interested in joining western institutions;
                    Sweden was a good bridge for many of them both to see what a nominally
                    non-aligned country looked like in terms of its defense alliances or
                    non-alliances, as well as its economic system. We were able to work very
                    collegially with the Swedes in helping the newly independent states —
                    specifically the Baltic states because they were the closest neighbors — to
                    become familiar with western-style democracy, with market-based systems, and
                    with crafting a foreign policy that would contribute to stability in Europe. The
                    Swedes were our partners in that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Sweden and Poland? Was there much affinity there
                        at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I can't think of many direct ties. I met a number of Poles who had come
                    to Sweden as a consequence of the rise of the Nazis. I'm thinking of one Polish
                    gentleman who was the director of the Stockholm Institute for Peace Research. He
                    had a very interesting Holocaust story. There were some others like that that I
                    recall, but I don't know how large the community of Poles living in Sweden
                    was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even though they're on the Baltic, you think of the Poles
                        as part of the European-German connection.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: That's right. When I think of the Baltic states, I think primarily of
                    Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. Poland is a Baltic state but kind of in a
                    different category.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much affinity between the Swedes and the
                        Finns?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: Sure. There were fine fraternal feelings between Sweden and all of its
                    Scandinavian neighbors. Centuries ago, there were conflicts and struggles, but
                    at this point in time, they had resolved those. They're all members of the EU
                    except for Norway. So, their natural cultural and linguistic ties are only
                    strengthened by the fact that there's so much commerce between them and the
                    citizens move freely from one country to another. The languages are extremely
                    similar, with the exception of Finnish, of course, which is off there on its
                    own, languagewise. There is a Scandinavian bloc often in the EU where those
                    countries see eye to eye on a lot of issues that tend to differentiate them from
                    their southern neighbors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Swedish media? This was your main
                        concern, wasn't it? I'm thinking of radio, but particularly the press and
                        TV.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: They were by and large very professional, well-trained. They were
                    sophisticated, or at least most of them were, and not as inclined to just make
                    knee-jerk criticisms of the United States. I think we worked very amicably with
                    them and had a good dialogue. It wasn't an acrimonious relationship at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There had been a time, particularly in the '60s and '70s
                        where the Swedes, particularly the left-wing and the intellgiencia, were
                        really having a wonderful time dumping on the U.S. and looking at the warts
                        and nothing else. Had that gone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: That generation has by and large disappeared. Yes, there is a communist
                    party still in Sweden and they have their media organs and they will never be
                    friends of the United States. They are not going to say anything good about us.
                    But the mainstream media, first, they were looking largely to local issues like
                    any media would do, and then to European issues and, yes, international issues
                    for sure. But at that time, we were not engaged in any war, and there really
                    wasn't an immediate cause for strident concern. The Swedish media is very
                    different than what it was in the '60s, when there were many activists who were
                    vociferous against the war in Vietnam. Many Americans did end up in Sweden, so
                    there was a reason for them to pay attention. Sure, that was the climate of that
                    time. That has changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Americans who went there? Have they all gone
                        back? Was there an American dissident community?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: No, I thought there should be and I was on the watch for it, but I can't
                    say that I really encountered it. Every now and again, I'd meet someone who,
                    yes, had been there since the '60s, but they were not necessarily dissidents.
                    There were also a number of Americans who traveled to Sweden and ended up
                    staying. Maybe they married a Swede. But it wasn't that they were dissidents. It
                    was just an inviting place to go and if they liked it, they stayed. The vocal
                    critics, I'm sure there were still some who remained there, but they weren't
                    making their presence felt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that you had to protect your ambassador from
                        hostility or warn him or was this a fairly open media market?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: We were viewed very amicably. The Swedes were friendly and the media
                    likewise were not hostile. The ambassador didn't have any problems in that
                    sense. We can contrast it with Greece, which was diametrically opposed. Sweden
                    was a lovely place to be an ambassador because you generally didn't encounter
                    the hostile press that you would find here, for example.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Clinton administration had its problems both personal,
                        with the Lewinsky case, but also the problems with Congress which since the
                        election of '92 was not only hostile but quite hostile to the
                        administration. Did that get played out in the Swedish press?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: We talked a lot about the lack of civility in our political discourse. I
                    think it is still remarkable, was then and is still quite a remarkable
                    characteristic. Things have not gotten markedly better, but those were the days
                    of the Contract with America and Newt Gingrich and his plans, most of which
                    didn't happen. I think there is no good explanation for why our politicians
                    behave the way they do. It's rather an embarrassment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a very bad period. Were you there during the

                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: No, by then, I was here studying Greek.</p>

                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: Russia has always been a concern in Sweden. Even then, yes, trying to
                    know what was going to happen in Russia was of great interest to them, and there
                    was certainly a large degree of mistrust of the Russians based on their past
                    history. There was great interest in dialogue and we tried to foment at the time
                    quite useful and forward looking foreign policy seminars that brought the
                    Eastern European countries together with the Russian foreign minister to talk
                    about the future of that region. It was a new beginning. Now, these seem like
                    rather tame discussions because all of those countries are now members of
                    Partnership for Peace and some of them have gone on to become NATO members. It
                    was really a new concept for both Americans and for those countries as well, to
                    imagine the close military alliance that now exists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Swedes had been very much involved with African
                        countries, particularly promoting their form of socialism. It's turned out
                        to be kind of a disaster, Tanzania and other places. Was there a great
                        interest in Africa at that time? Did we get involved with the Swedes in
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I can't say that the Swedes had lost interest in Africa, but it wasn't
                    one of our goals at the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were doing their thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Right. I'm at a loss to recall what our policy in Africa was. Up until
                    that time, we were not heavily engaged. President Clinton did make an important
                    visit to several countries in Africa. It was the first that he had done. This
                    was in '96 or '97. It was kind of a catch-up initiative, since we had largely
                    neglected much of Africa. The Swedes on their own have a wonderful tradition of
                    being very generous in terms of development assistance and medical assistance
                    and they would try to shame us into being more generous ourselves, but it wasn't
                    a big issue, at least in my office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How well did you feel the Swedes were absorbing immigrants
                        coming from other countries, particularly Eastern Europe?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: They were very concerned about immigration. The war in Bosnia created a
                    lot of refugees and prospective immigrants. Many of them came to Sweden under
                    its enlightened refugee policies. The Swedes felt that maybe they ought to
                    actively try to persuade them to return home when conditions were right. The
                    large number of immigrants was perceived to be tipping the balance in their
                    society. There were other waves of immigration well before thathe Turkish
                    immigration in the '70s, for example. Every day, you would have articles in the
                    press that were immigrant stories, how well they were integrating or not
                    integrating. The Swedes did a lot of soul searching on that issue. Their
                    philosophy was to be welcoming on the one hand. On the other hand, they felt
                    that they were a small society. They were homogenous and if too many outsiders
                    were allowed to remain, then their society would no longer be homogenous and
                    they wondered how that would play out in terms of the social contract that they
                    had enjoyed with their citizens. They were afraid on that level. They provided
                    tremendous benefits to people who were there legally. They taught them Swedish
                    for one thing. Kids were given individual tutoring and brought up to speed in
                    Swedish in record time. They were subsidized economically so that they had a
                    very decent standard of living quite early on. So they did a lot, but they did
                    feel the strains of the cost of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of that, was there a feeling in the embassy about
                        Sweden's very substantial and very nice, but very expensive, social program.
                        I would think this would cut down on entrepreneurship and initiative and so
                        on. How did we feel about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: There were many Swedish economists who pointed out that there were some
                    real problems with their system that was so very generous. One of them often
                    cited the example that a Swedish doctor would not be making appreciably more
                    than a Swedish housepainter and so the doctor had no incentive to hire the
                    painter for his house. He would logically decide to paint the house himself
                    because he would have the time and it would cost him relatively too much to hire
                    this painter. If he did a couple gallbladder operations, he wasn't going to come
                    out ahead economically. So that created some tensions. The education minister
                    was very adamant that there should not be anything that could smack of elitism
                    in the schools. His thinking was that you wouldn't want to encourage the high
                    achievers to propel themselves too quickly or too far because that would make
                    the middle, the average, feel somehow less good about themselves, so you really
                    wanted everybody to be average. The system tried to help those who needed help
                    to bring them up to that average standard, but there shouldn't be any effort to
                    really encourage outstanding achievement. In his opinion, those who were going
                    to be outstanding achievers would do that on their own anyway. You didn't have
                    to encourage them, so emphasis should be placed on making things as equal as
                    possible. They did a good job of making things as equal as possible, with the
                    downside that entrepreneurs sometimes felt they should make their company
                    headquarters at least someplace else, because they would not be taxed as much
                    and they would have greater flexibility in hiring and firing and the labor laws
                    might be more conducive to the growth of their company. A lot of them did make
                    that decision.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find running a USIS operation difficult under
                        their labor laws?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: My short answer is “no.” We're a government organization and we had very
                    careful safeguards to protect the rights of workers. We don't operate like the
                    private sector. Therefore, if, for example, you felt you needed to terminate an
                    underperformer, I would not say that in our government structure that's an easy
                    thing to do. You have to do quite a bit of due diligence, counseling,
                    documentation. The process is going to take a fair amount of time. You have to
                    commit yourself early if you want to get it done. Therefore, we could follow
                    that procedure and not be doing anything unethical. I don't know if the Swedes
                    would have done it the same way, but at least we weren't acting in an extreme
                    fashion. I can't think of any instance where we had problems with Swedish labor
                    law because of what we were trying to do. I think we obeyed Swedish labor law to
                    the extent we were obliged to do so and were fair in the way we structured our
                    personnel system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm taking as an assumption that we didn't have to push
                        English teaching because the Swedes already got that through the school
                        system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: That's basically true. The Swedes speak very good English and they do
                    teach themselves English. We would make a contribution in the higher graduate
                    level American studies area, but we didn't need to promote English teaching in
                    the same way that you would in most other countries. We did have a program
                    still, but it was small and not that important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Swedes going to the United States to study? Was
                        there a solid pattern of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Sure. The Fulbright Program is one way to go to the U.S. to study that
                    the Swedes took great advantage of, because they were very well qualified and
                    could get, in addition to a small Fulbright grant, help from the U.S. schools.
                    There were reasonable numbers who took that route. On the other hand, Swedish
                    universities were virtually free to them, so you wouldn't see people going at
                    the undergraduate level. The system is quite different, so if you grew up in the
                    Swedish secondary school, not that many of them would be thinking of an American
                    university until graduate studies.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With graduate school, was there a brain drain because of
                        the relatively rigid Swedish system? When you have that much control, I
                        would think that the free spirits would want to get the hell out.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes, I'll bet that's a reasonable characterization, that those who don't
                    fit in would look elsewhere. Where they were looking at the time I was there
                    were the many options proliferating thanks to the European Union. A great many
                    exchange programs were sponsored within the European Union. I think that was the
                    first choice for most of them because it was affordable, closer, they might not
                    need to know a language other than English either because there are sectors of
                    the German universities that teach in English or the French universities taking
                    EU students and teaching in English. So that wasn't a big problem for them. Then
                    later on, they could be hoping for a career in Europe and that was a big issue
                    given the low rate of job creation in Sweden itself. Many of the university
                    graduates realized they did need to go somewhere else and Europe was the first
                    thought for most of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the war in Bosnia play out in Sweden?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: It was front page news for years while we were there. The Swedes had
                    some peacekeepers or some military contribution in Tuzla (Hungary)..</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a very large contingent of many countries
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: There were contributions from most everywhere there. The Swedish
                    presence was small, but they were doing their part, they thought. The refugee
                    issue was big. The human rights issue concerned them quite a bit. The
                    establishment of viable democracy in Bosnia-Herzegovina was of great interest to
                    them. They have some very skilled diplomats who were mediating. Karl Bildt, the
                    former Swedish prime minister, was one of the mediators. He wasn't the last, so
                    obviously the job was very difficult. Swedes were quite engaged in Bosnia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a problem explaining why we didn't go in at
                        first or was this applauded? At first they said, “This is a European problem
                        and we can take care of this.” The result was horrible.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: That's right. I think the Swedes went along with the European line
                    publicly. I don't know what they would say privately. Probably, they would admit
                    it was a good thing when the U.S. took action. In the run-up to the Dayton
                    Accords, Ambassador Holbrooke had quite a bit of interaction with the Swedish
                    mediator, Karl Bildt, and I think they worked closely together to resolve this
                    conflict. You certainly get that impression from Holbrooke's book, To End a
                    War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there during the assassination of Olaf
                        Palme?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: No, he was assassinated in 1976, a long time ago. But the issue had not
                    yet been laid to rest even at the time I was there. Of course, it had been
                    heavily investigated at the time and for many years since. Occasionally, there
                    would be new developments. There was someone taken into custody while I was
                    there. His name was Christer Pettersson. I think they have reasonably well
                    concluded that he is the guilty party. He did it on his own. It was not a
                    political murder. He was a lifelong criminal. I forget what his reasoning was on
                    that day. He was a drug addict, but whether he was under the influence at that
                    moment I don't know. It reminds you of the recent attack on the Swedish foreign
                    minister, who was killed while shopping at a department store. That individual
                    also was not politically motivated. He was found to be insane as well. The Olaf
                    Palme murder was a wakeup call for the Swedes that not everyone was going to be
                    as civilized as they hoped in their country. As we saw from the Anna Lind
                    murder, the level of violence is very low in Sweden, but it does happen and it
                    is always shocking to the Swedes when something like that happens. But, Swedish
                    government officials do not go around with bodyguards. Normally, they don't need
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find social life there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Very welcoming. We were there with our two sons and they played a lot of
                    sports with the Swedes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How old were your sons at the time you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Seven and 11. They were able to enjoy things Swedish. We were
                    homeschooling them while they were there, so they didn't per se have a school
                    class that they were part of, but they took part in scouts and sports with
                    Swedish kids. It's a very child friendly or family-friendly country. The Swedes
                    are very sportsminded. They're very fitness oriented. You easily get sucked into
                    being active, which is good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the four years you were there, were there any
                        crisis points?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: On the foreign relations side, probably not. The important developments
                    were in technology. We really saw the IT revolution take hold and it meant a
                    significant change in how we were doing business. The Swedes were in the
                    forefront of computer use, Internet use and development. Our embassy had one of
                    the first home pages, web pages, and that was an important development. We also
                    saw what was from my point of view a significant event, which was the decision
                    to dismantle USIA. In the run-up to that, partial dismantlement took place.
                    There were major personnel and budget cuts; our operation diminished in a big
                    way, never to be replaced. We went out of the library business and the English
                    teaching business and we cut staff dramatically. That was the run-up to the
                    merger. Some of those functions that USIA used to do remain but maybe in a
                    somewhat atrophied capacity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at it in retrospect, did you feel this was a
                        needed development or did it really hurt our operations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I think it makes sense to have everything under one roof. The public
                    diplomacy function can well be part of the State Department. If administratively
                    you want to do that, I don't have a philosophical objection. But in the wake of
                    the merger, many report that it's too easy for public diplomacy to be considered
                    a stepchild and not to be viewed as significantly as it was when public
                    diplomacy was the essence of an entire agency. So, that has an impact on
                    resources and on how members of the Department utilize the public diplomacy
                    resources that they have. Colin Powell was a great supporter of public
                    diplomacy, so his leadership was a positive thing. But you still see in the
                    Department, particularly among the older generation of folks, not as much
                    understanding of what the USIS functions are and should be and could be and that
                    has led to an abiding denigration of its role.</p>
                <p>If you were to do the merger correctly, it could be a reasonable thing
                    bureaucratically, but I'm not sure that's what happened. There were efforts to
                    preserve some of the best practices of USIA. I'm not sure that too many that
                    were preserved, though there was an effort to do that. Then, you would logically
                    want to make sure that those things that USIA did especially well, like
                    exchanges and personal diplomacy, were preserved and presumably enhanced because
                    their importance was recognized and their funding ensured. That's a difficult
                    thing to do when we have so many more bureaus competing for resources, even in
                    an era of expanding resources.</p>

                <p>NIELSEN: For two years.</p>

                </p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As public affairs officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I was cultural affairs officer.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a difficult time with the Greeks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes. Probably most eras have been difficult with the Greeks, but this
                    was no exception. We were engaged in the former Yugoslavia, bombing in Kosovo,
                    and this was not a popular policy in Greece. The government was not much in
                    favor of it either, but in particular the press were quite anti. So the usual
                    level of anti-American demonstrations was ratcheted up to a pretty significant
                    level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was your ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Nicholas Burns.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he was one of our top diplomats.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he work with the public diplomacy side of

                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: He was very interested in public diplomacy. Of course, as someone who
                    had been press spokesman, he knew a lot about it and he knew how he wanted to
                    conduct his public diplomacy, so he set the tone.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As cultural affairs officer, what sort of things were you
                        doing in Greece?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: We have an ongoing annual American studies seminar which is a very
                    useful event because the universities, though they're longstanding, don't really
                    teach, at least not as a separate entity, U.S. literature, history or political
                    science, so there's a gap there. I think the two week- long American studies
                    course that is offered is an important contribution to that. We also do the
                    typical seminars on other issues. We did one, for example, on biotechnology at
                    the time that Europe was voicing great skepticism about biotech foods. Of
                    course, our position is that they're safe and we would like to export them, so
                    there was a need to try to educate the public to the science involved in this
                    field.</p>
                <p>In the area of American politics, we had elections coming up. I was there at the
                    time of the 2000 elections, so we had a number of programs that were designed to
                    help the Greek media and Greeks know what the issues were in the U.S. at that
                    time.</p>
                <p>There is also a small but significant number of American universities in Greece.
                    This is kind of a phenomenon because the Greek constitution does not allow
                    private universities. One of our goals was to convince the Greeks that maybe
                    there could be a way to expand their public university system to embrace these
                    private universities, which happen to be American universities. We felt that
                    they offered an American-style education which was particularly strong in
                    business and in technology, areas where traditionally the Greek universities
                    were not so interested. That was another main focus of our activity.</p>
                <p>We did some cultural events. Of course, Greece is quite prominent in theater and
                    in the arts, so we could take advantage of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Greek government response to trying
                        to move American style education in at some level, business training or this
                        sort of thing? Any luck while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I can't say that we cracked this very knotty issue of allowing private
                    education in Greece. The Greek constitution expressly forbids it. Of course,
                    there is a way to amend the constitution, but that was difficult and while in
                    practice these universities were thriving because the Greeks recognized the
                    value of attending them and they sent their sons and daughters, the formal
                    recognition is something that has not yet been achieved. I left in 2001. It's
                    still a pending issue. It was an issue of concern well before I got there. I
                    think it's going to go on.</p>

                <p>NIELSEN: Right, and funding probably was heavily coming from DOD. With the
                    closing of the bases, the school remained and still remains, though it was
                    suffering. There were many fewer American kids to go there. But it is one of the
                    schools that the embassy sent its kids to.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: We used to say that there are no more than 10% of Greeks who are really
                    anti-American. That 10% can make a lot of noise. They can stir up
                    demonstrations. They can write lots of editorials and so on. But you would not
                    really feel that you were in a hostile environment. As an American diplomat, we
                    found that by and large it was reasonably pleasant to deal with the Greeks.
                    There may be obstacles, but they weren't anti-American obstacles. They were just
                    procedural obstacles where the system was very difficult to get things done. The
                    ministries were very inefficient and largely ineffectual, but that wasn't
                    necessarily a reflection of anti-Americanism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a reflection of Greece.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: That's right. Greek reality, with a long tradition of a bureaucracy that
                    just really doesn't move. The Greeks are aware of that, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you run afoul of the Greek Orthodox Church at all in
                        the cultural affairs field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes, the Greek Orthodox Church took a vocal stance in favor of the
                    brother Serbs, which was not our view of the war in Serbia. They were definitely
                    partisan. One would like to think that the church was a force for peace and
                    reconciliation. I'm not sure I would say that about the Greek Orthodox Church.
                    They were pretty obscurantist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Serb Orthodox Church is also. I served a long time
                        both in Greece and in Yugoslavia. The Orthodox churches there were at the
                        heart of the nationalism and the nastiness that turned into close to
                        genocide.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: That's right. Surprisingly, and it should be surprising, it you have a
                    faith-based organization, they shouldn't be into genocide despite the fact that
                    they are very nationalistic. Indeed, the Greek Orthodox Church was supremely
                    nationalistic. But they should see a contradiction between supporting genocide
                    and professing Christianity. The Greek Church was clearly very nationalistic and
                    not an easy interlocutor in any event.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it impact on any of your cultural events?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Not very directly, I don't believe. The Greeks, and certainly the ones
                    we were working with, while they were culturally Orthodox, they were not
                    practicing their religion very much. When the arch-patriarch would speak, he
                    would command an audience, but, on a daily basis, the Greeks were not hanging on
                    the word of the church. They were going about their secular business pretty
                    much. Was that the case when you were there as well?</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When I was there, the Greek bishops forbad bathing of
                        women and men in the same lake or something like that, and they were against
                        a magician's show. But nobody paid much attention to it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: And of course, bathing in a lake doesn't happen very much. You went out
                    to the sea. I guess you could always segregate the beaches.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was up north near Larissa, where there was a lake or
                        something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Yes, well, they have evolved some.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the cultural side, did you get involved in trying to
                        explain the election of 2002, which dragged on and on because of the Florida
                        vote and so on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Oh, yes, that was a topic. We ended up not having the traditional
                    election night program. That turned out to be a good thing because election
                    night just went on for a month. But we did make a valiant effort to make people
                    aware of what was happening and to try to explain that it really wasn't a
                    crisis, even though it was being portrayed as a crisis worldwide. People in
                    America were going about their lives pretty much as they had been before. Yes,
                    they did want to get it settled, but at least it really didn't provoke a
                    constitutional crisis or a crisis in fact. It makes you examine our system more
                    closely. Trying to justify the Electoral College is not very easy. It doesn't
                    make a lot of sense actually, except as a historical artifact, but it doesn't
                    seem as though it's going to be changing any time soon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Greek-American community play any role in what you
                        were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: They were a big presence. They were very well organized, very
                    enthusiastic. They would send their delegations frequently to visit and the
                    ambassador was very welcoming to them and definitely felt that we should partner
                    with the Greek-Americans whenever possible. We did do that. They are certainly a
                    force. The Greek Diaspora is as large as the population of Greece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in the name of Macedonia? Or was this
                        something you tried to avoid?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: The worst of that had already taken place by the time I got there. But,
                    yes, we in our Washington files, in our daily bulletins and so on, didn't always
                    use the full name of the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia [FYROM].
                    Technically, that was the correct name, but occasionally you would see official
                    pronouncements from Colin Powell... I can recall sending someone something under
                    my signature, a monthly bulletin or something, and getting a letter back from
                    someone who said, “Oh, since when has the United States gone on record as
                    supporting Macedonia in its claim to use our name?” It was because we had sent
                    something that, instead of referring to FYROM used “The Republic of Macedonia”
                    most probably. I think the Greeks were becoming more culturally aware of their
                    neighbor to the north. They're just going to have to accept that there's going
                    to be a country by the name of Macedonia. The rest of the world really didn't
                    much care.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>In 2001, what happened?</p>
                <p>NIELSEN: I decided to retire. It felt like a good thing to do at the time. After
                    25 years, our older son was going off to college and the younger one was
                    starting high school, so it seemed that that was the appropriate juncture to
                    come back to the U.S., allow my husband to resume his careerather, not so much
                    to resume, but carve out a career, and then I would be secondary and tend to
                    other interesting things. So that's what I decided to do. I wasn't actually
                    obliged to retire at that time, but I decided to do it, so we came back to
                    Virginia. I have now returned to work part-time at State, but I'm a retiree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were in Sweden and Greece, what was
                        your husband up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: In Sweden, he was doing the supervising of the homeschooling for our
                    sons. Then in Greece, did some consulting in the computer field. He did
                    considerable self-study in computer programming with the idea that when we
                    returned here, he would get a job in the computer/ high-tech field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When they came back, how did your kids adjust to American
                        schooling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Quite well, actually. They didn't seem to find things too surprising.
                    Our older son was happy with the freedom you find on college campuses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did he go to school?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>NIELSEN: He went to Virginia Tech. Our younger son started high school at
                    Yorktown High School in Arlington. He likes the school. It's his first “big
                    school” experience, but he's really adjusted very nicely. Yes, I can't
                    complain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Great, Barbara, I'll think we'll stop at this point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: Well, I thank you. You're a good host.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's been fun.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>NIELSEN: You have to keep yourself apprized of world events everywhere, I
                    guess.</p>
