                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wolf Lehmann went to Vietnam in June 1973, initially as
                        Consul General in the city of Can Tho, which is located in the Mekong Delta.
                        He then went to Saigon in March 1974 as Deputy Chief of Mission to
                        Ambassador Graham Martin. For frequent periods he was Charg� d' Affaires
                        during that 13 months or so prior to the final fall of Saigon on April 30,
                        1975.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>This period from the time that Mr. Lehmann arrived in Vietnam was one in which
                    support for the war in the United States was declining. We were getting into the
                    beginning of the second Nixon Administration. Watergate was opening severe
                    wounds in the American body politic.</p>
                <p>As time went on and as public support for the war declined, the difficulty of
                    gaining material support from Congress for the South Vietnamese Government was
                    increasing drastically, as well. This was a time, of course, when there were no
                    American military forces in the country. These had long been withdrawn. This was
                    a period when it was still hoped that somehow the South Vietnamese Government
                    would be able to maintain its independence from the communist North Vietnam.</p>
                <p>With that background, I believe we are in a position to begin the interview.</p>
                <p>There were many opinions as to why South Vietnam—that is, the Republic of
                    Vietnam—ceased to exist at the end of April 1975. Some people claim that the
                    fate of Vietnam was sealed from the very moment that the Paris agreements were
                    signed in December 1972 over the strong objections of President Thieu, and that
                    all that really remained was the so-called decent interval before the end. Do
                    you agree with that view?</p>
                <p>LEHMANN: I think the Paris accords were severely deficient in several respects,
                    but I don't agree that with the signing of the accords the end was preordained
                    to be what it eventually came to be at the end of April 1975.</p>
                <p>The agreement was, indeed, deficient, in certainly two major respects, the most
                    important of which was that it allowed the North Vietnamese Army to remain in
                    South Vietnam.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>Another deficiency was the fiction that there existed something called the PRG,
                    the People's Revolutionary Government of South Vietnam, and that we accepted the
                    notion that this fictitious entity was a legitimate party to the Paris
                    agreements. That, incidentally, is why we at the embassy, whenever we had to
                    refer to the PRG, we always put it in quotes. We never let it stand on its own
                    as we would for the DRV, which was the formal official title of North
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <p>Hanoi certainly considered the Paris accords to be a victory for them and
                    publicly said so after the fall of South Vietnam. Nevertheless, I don't believe
                    that the end was inevitable. Everything depended on whether the United States
                    and South Vietnam were able and willing—and I want to underscore “willing”—and
                    primarily the United States, would insist that the agreement be carried out as
                    written.</p>
                <p>It was particularly important that the United States show willingness to back up
                    that insistence with some sort of force if that should become necessary. That
                    would not necessarily have meant the re-introduction of American ground forces,
                    but certainly the possible reintroduction of American air power was a factor in
                    the background. Of course, that did not come to be.</p>
                <p>Immediately after the Paris agreements went into effect, Congress, at the
                    initiative of Senator Church, prohibited the reintroduction of U.S. combat
                    forces into Vietnam. That bit of Congressional myopia—or worse—left us very
                    little leverage to insist that Hanoi honor the terms of the agreement. In fact,
                    our aid to the Republic of Vietnam, both military and economic, was
                    progressively reduced very soon after the agreements came into effect, and U.S.
                    intervention, of course, became increasingly remote as a political crisis
                    developed in Washington, a crisis that eventually led to the Nixon
                    resignation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I believe that, on the other hand, Soviet and Chinese aid
                        was continuing, or at least Soviet aid. Could you comment on the extent of
                        that support and the contrast between that flow of communist aid to North
                        Vietnam and the decrease in aid by the United States to the Republic of
                        South Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Both Soviet and Chinese, especially Soviet aid, was continuing at a very
                    heavy pace. The agreement had a provision in it that both sides could replace
                    military items—ammunition, hardware etc.—on a one-for-one basis in South
                    Vietnam. We never did that, because we never had adequate budgetary facilities
                    to actually replace military items lost by the South Vietnamese during that sort
                    of lower-intensity period of conflict that went on in 1973 and 1974. Moreover,
                    the restriction did not apply to North Vietnam.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>There was absolutely no way of ensuring the other side's compliance with that
                    particular provision. It was simply disregarded. Hanoi did not permit the
                    ICCS—the International Commission for Control and Supervision—to exercise its
                    authority in that regard even if it had wanted to. Hanoi did not agree to the
                    requirement, also stipulated in the Paris agreements, that there should be
                    established certain entry points through which this one-for-one replacement of
                    ammunition and other military items would be monitored. So these were never
                    established, except on our side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There may well have been two or three times as much as the
                        authorized one-for-one level coming in, for all anyone knows, at least more
                        than the mere replacement flow of materiel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Oh, it was far more than that. The magnitude of the amount of
                    ammunition, military equipment, trucks and weapons was even alluded to by
                    General Van Tien Dung, who was the North Vietnamese commander who eventually
                    conquered the South. When you read his account, which was first published in
                    Nhan Dan, the Hanoi newspaper, in serial fashion and later as a book, when you
                    read his account, he speaks of thousands of trucks and guns being moved to the
                    South on the Ho Chi Minh Trail Network. No, it was never honored at all by
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to the broader course of the war and the
                        situation in both Washington and Asia, you've been quoted as saying that the
                        reason why the war ended in a North Vietnamese military victory at the time
                        it did—that is in April 1975—was Watergate. Would you comment further on
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Hanoi, of course, had never given up the idea of eventually conquering
                    the South. As far as they were concerned, it was a question as to when and how.
                    We knew there were differences of opinion in the Hanoi leadership during the
                    period of 1973 and well into 1974 as to what should be given priority. The
                    question that was facing them at the time—and we had a fairly good reading on
                    that from our admittedly fragmentary intelligence, but a fairly good capacity
                    for making an accurate estimate—the question facing them was whether they should
                    divert resources to deal with their serious, domestic internal problems, and put
                    eventual unification of the country under their control on a longer term
                    basis—Asiatics think in long terms, very long terms—or whether they should go
                    for broke quickly and force an early solution. They had quite an argument about
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>President Nixon resigned in early August of 1974. That was followed within a week
                    by a drastic reduction of U.S. military assistance to South Vietnam, mandated by
                    Congress. In fact, the vote that reduced the amount down to $700 million, which
                    was less than half of what we had been using earlier, and much of that $700
                    million wasn't really available, a point I will elaborate on later on, that vote
                    was preceded by a vote on a resolution that all military aid to South Vietnam
                    should be cut off. And 26 members of the United States Senate voted to cut off
                    all aid immediately. These were the facts that led to a decision by the Hanoi
                    leadership to undertake a large-scale massive offensive operation in 1975 in an
                    effort to end the war on their terms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And take advantage of this situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Hanoi's decision was based on its evaluation of the political situation
                    in the United States. They concluded, that given the political situation in
                    Washington resulting from the Watergate crisis, the United States would not
                    effectively interevene. At the embassy in Saigon, in a message that I sent to
                    Washington as Charg� at the time, on August 13, 1974, we said that what had been
                    happening in Washington—primarily in the form of the drastic reduction of
                    military assistance to South Vietnam— would lead to a political decision by
                    Hanoi to make an all out military effort to conquer the South. And we were quite
                    correct in that estimate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You certainly were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: As far as we were able to ascertain, the decision must have been made in
                    early September of 1974. Subsequently, General Dung, in his account called The
                    Great Spring Victory, confirmed publicly after the end of the war that the
                    decision was made about that time and was ratified by a meeting of the Political
                    Bureau and the Central Military Party Committee in North Vietnam in early
                    October. So the full scenario which led to the political decision by Hanoi in
                    early fall 1974 to make an all out military effort in early 1975 was
                    precipitated by the political crisis in the United States in the summer of
                    1974.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any reaction to your message?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>LEHMANN: No, nor, being cynical did I really expect any. Our message began with a
                    summarized assessment of hte military situation we were in because of the
                    reduction in the DAV Program. General John Murray, who was the Defense Attach�
                    at the time, worked out that part for me and sent it in in greater detail to the
                    Pentagon. On the technical side there were some interesting points, including
                    the fact that we thought the Vietnam program was being double charged for the
                    procurement of F-5 aircraft for the Vietnamese Air Force and that the American
                    military services had a habit of charging large amounts of the appropriation to
                    overhead costs, usually designated as PCH and T —which stands for packing,
                    crating, handling and transportation— leaving little for guns, bullets and
                    training. But, the really important part of the message was that what Congress
                    was doing was to signal to Hanoi that it could proceed with a military option to
                    win the war and that the United States did not have the will to stand in its
                    way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that there was a conference in Hanoi during
                        which the decision was ratified to enter into an all-out offensive against
                        the South and try to complete the conquest. Did you find any further
                        confirmation of that as time went on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: We did, but only after General Dung published the piece I referred to
                    before. That account includes a very interesting statement on how important
                    Hanoi's appraisal of the political situation in Washington was in its
                    decision-making process. It's a very revealing statement. He says, “The internal
                    contradictions of the U.S. administration and among political parties had
                    intensified. The Watergate scandal had seriously affected the entire United
                    States and precipitated the resignation of an extremely reactionary
                    President—Nixon. The United States faced economic recession, mounting inflation,
                    serious unemployment and an oil crisis. Also, the U.S. allies were not on good
                    terms with the United States. U.S. aid to the Saigon puppet administration was
                    decreasing.” Then he goes on to say—and quotes from the resolution that was
                    adopted by that particular conference, which says, “Having already withdrawn
                    from the South, the United States could hardly jump back in, and no matter how
                    it might intervene, it would be unable to save the Saigon administration from
                    collapse.”</p>
                <p>There are numerous other references in this account illustrating just how
                    decisively the political crisis in the U.S. figured in the North Vietnamese
                    decision-making process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are you saying, in effect, then, that if it had not been
                        for Watergate, the South Vietnamese regime would have survived, and South
                        Vietnam would exist today as an independent country?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>LEHMANN: Not necessarily. What I'm saying is the outcome would not have been what
                    it was at the time that it took place. Certainly, that South Vietnam would have
                    survived as an independent entity is within the realm of possibility, but no
                    more than that. So all I'm really saying is you would not have seen that
                    particular outcome at that particular time at the end of April 1975 that we did
                    see. It would have been something different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned earlier that the Soviet Union and, to a
                        lesser extent, I suppose, China was continuing to supply the North
                        Vietnamese forces at a very high rate, in spite of the fall-off in support
                        by the United States. Can you talk a little bit about the Soviet role more
                        generally, in addition to the supply issue? Did the Soviet Union have an
                        effect on the North Vietnamese decision-making process, for example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Oh, it certainly did. I don't think there is any question about that.
                    There was historical precedent for that. In the spring of 1972, about a week
                    before the North Vietnamese Easter Offensive kicked off in an earlier phase of
                    the war, a large Soviet mission, headed by the then-Soviet Deputy Defense
                    Minister, Mr. Vapiski, visited Hanoi. They played a role in the decision on that
                    particular operation. There was a repeat of that in 1974, when the Soviet Deputy
                    Chief of Staff, General Kulikov, who later became the Warsaw Pact commander in
                    Europe headed a very large mission to Hanoi about a week or so before Christmas
                    1974. That followed an earlier trip by a big North Vietnamese military
                    delegation to Moscow in November. Now, Kulikov didn't come to Hanoi to sing
                    Christmas carols in the streets of the city, a phrase, incidentally, I put into
                    a cable I sent at the time on that particular event. It was obvious that Kulikov
                    came to Hanoi with that delegation to wrap up final details regarding the
                    decision to proceed with the offensive which had reached the point of no return,
                    and to wrap up arrangements for Soviet military assistance and support of the
                    operation.</p>
                <p>It is ironical that these events should be taking place at about the very time
                    that President Ford and Secretary Kissinger met with the Russians at
                    Vladivostok, in November, at about the time when the North Vietnamese military
                    delegation visited Moscow and about a month before Kulikov reciprocated the
                    visit with his delegation to Hanoi. One of the things that has always troubled
                    me is that the word “Vietnam” was not mentioned by anybody at the Vladivostok
                    summit meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You discussed the Soviet role. The Chinese role was less
                        important, obviously. But I recall from my own time in INR a few years
                        earlier that the Chinese, during the height of the Cultural Revolution, had
                        interfered with the transit of Soviet supplies by rail overland to Vietnam.
                        Can you comment on the way in which the Chinese were trying to counter
                        Soviet influence by providing supplies of their own, the extent to which
                        they might have been hindering the Soviets, and the degree to which the
                        Soviets were bringing in supplies both overland and by other means, say by
                        ship, to Haiphong or by air?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>LEHMANN: Most military and other AID reached North Vietnam by ship and air,
                    rather than overland. As near as we could tell, the Chinese were in somewhat of
                    a quandary. On one hand, as you remarked, they wanted to preserve influence in
                    Hanoi. On the other hand, they were quite disturbed by the situation. I believe,
                    but do not recall for certain, that some Soviet items reached North Vietnam
                    overland, but only after much delay. In the middle of 1974 the Chinese suddenly
                    grabbed the South Vietnamese claimed Paracel Islands. That did not sit well
                    either in Hanoi or Saigon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were very much preoccupied with the Soviet threat on
                        their northern border.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: That's correct. As to Vietnam, ideology said they should help the
                    Socialist brethren but reality and history said the Vietnamese would be a
                    problem. So, they decided to take advntage of the situation and enforce their
                    claim to the Paracels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At one point you mentioned the International Commission
                        for Control and Supervision, that is, the ICCS, and alluded to the fact that
                        even if it had wanted to do something in regard to Soviet supplies, it
                        probably couldn't, but the implication was that the ICCS probably didn't
                        want to anyway. Do you want to comment a little bit further on the role of
                        the ICCS? Mention what it is first. Some listeners might not realize its
                        composition.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: The ICCS, the International Commission for Control and Supervision, was
                    part of the Paris agreements. It was the kind of thing that Americans are
                    generally fond of as a solution to problems. It had been tried in Indochina at
                    an earlier stage. It hadn't worked then and didn't work in 1973 to 1975. It was
                    composed originally of Canada, Indonesia, Poland, and Hungary.</p>
                <p>The Canadians gave up when they saw that it couldn't work, that the North
                    Vietnamese, the Poles and Hungarians wouldn't allow it to work. The Canadians
                    left it in the fall of 1973. I was sorry to see them go, but I certainly didn't
                    blame them for concluding that they would not be part of a farce.</p>
                <p>In addition to being ineffective as a mechanism to enforce compliance with the
                    Paris accords, the Hungarians and Poles - especially the Hungarians - played an
                    intelligence role on behalf of North Vietnam. Regardless of whatever differences
                    exist between the Hungarians and Poles on the one hand and the Soviet Union on
                    the other, there is very little doubt that their intelligence and security
                    services cooperate very closely with the Soviet intelligence and security
                    services - they are almost part of it - and by extension, in this case, with
                    North Vietnam.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>One of the most embarrassing things I had to go through repeatedly was to urge
                    the government of South Vietnam to pay its contribution to support the ICCS. It
                    was ridiculous, but I suppose one of the things that the people in our business
                    are called upon to do from time to time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think there might be some lessons in this
                        experience in regard to other places in the world, maybe Central
                        America?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: I think if there's any lesson in it, the one I would immediately urge
                    is, “Don't do it unless you are reasonably confident that the parties really
                    wish to observe the terms of whatever they agreed to.” If there's no political
                    will to abide by an agreement, a mechanism of this type cannot substitute for
                    the absence of that will.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Up to now, we've discussed the ending of the Vietnam War
                        largely in terms of the lack of will in the United States, the effect of
                        Watergate, and the subsequent changes in North Vietnamese strategies as
                        Hanoi became more optimistic regarding the much lower degree of support that
                        would be available to the South. Perhaps it's now time to shift to what the
                        situation on the ground was within South Vietnam. And perhaps an area on
                        which to begin would be the economic situation in the South.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: The economic situation in the South in the last two and some years,
                    1973-74 and early '75, and especially in the beginning, was certainly difficult,
                    but also one in which the Vietnamese demonstrated extraordinary resilience. In
                    1973, the first year when the Paris agreements were in effect, the Vietnamese
                    economy was hit by three developments. First, there were the economic
                    repercussions of the withdrawal of all American forces from Vietnam. Those
                    forces had, in a sense, been a boost to the economy by virtue of the money that
                    the people spent in the country. It was largely eliminated by late 1972 and
                    nonexistant from 1973 on. Second, there was the world-wide inflation, which
                    drove up prices for the Vietnamese and cut down the purchasing value of every
                    dollar of U.S. economic assistance and the smaller non-American aid projects
                    being carried out in the country.</p>
                <p>Finally, there was the 1973 oil crisis and oil shock which brought sharp
                    increases in petroleum prices. That, in turn, had effects on agriculture, on
                    transportation, on such other industries like fishing, where you use motorboats.
                    It also substantially reduced the value of every United States military
                    assistance dollar that went into POL for the South Vietnamese forces.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>By the end of 1973 and January 1974, the South Vietnamese economy had hit bottom.
                    The curve began to flatten out early in 1974. There were dire predictions at one
                    point that there would be a rice crisis in Saigon in late 1973 and 1974, which
                    would lead to riots in the streets. That did not come off. The government
                    managed the rice supply situation rather well, with some advice and assistance
                    from us, but they managed it quite well.</p>
                <p>By the fall of 1974, the agribusiness and rural credit system, which had been
                    developed particularly in the Mekong Delta was operating very well. There was
                    indeed a good prospect that Vietnam would regain self-sufficiency in rice in
                    1975, and certainly in 1976. In early 1975, just as full scale North Vietnamese
                    military operations began to get under way, we could look forward to a small
                    rice export surplus for South Vietnam, had it not been for the military
                    situation.</p>
                <p>Along with that, there were other developments. There was exploratory offshore
                    drilling for oil, starting in early 1974, which rapidly showed that the
                    prospects for commercially exploitable petroleum were very good indeed. In fact,
                    those operations had progressed to the point where in January and February 1975
                    the major companies involved in those exploratory projects wanted to discuss
                    production arrangements with the South Vietnamese Government. Of course, all of
                    that came to nothing because of the military situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've talked about the internal economic situation in
                        South Vietnam. Why don't we continue now to discuss the internal political
                        situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: The government of President Thieu was politically quite stable. Compared
                    to some previous experiences during earlier periods in Vietnam, including
                    earlier periods of our involvement -especially after the U.S. supported 1962
                    coup against Ngho Diem - it was a model of stability. The picture created and
                    systematically fostered by the well-organized and well-financed anti-Vietnam
                    lobby in the United States was that of a despotic regime which brutally
                    suppressed all legitimate political opposition and the press and engaged in
                    wholesale arrests and detentions of what were alleged to be tens and hundreds of
                    thousands of political prisoners. But of course, this was not true at all.</p>
                <p>Certainly Vietnam, nor any other Asian country, can be expected to run a kind of
                    New England-style town meeting democracy - especially in war time - which is
                    what a lot of Americans think foreigners ought to do. What existed in South
                    Vietnam at that time was a rather free-wheeling, open society, complete with
                    good points and some that were not so good. For example, there were 26
                    newspapers in Saigon being published at that time—26—most of them utterly
                    irresponsible. That was reduced to one after April 30, 1975, and it indeed was
                    fully responsible and was printing only what it was told to print.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>LEHMANN: Of course, there were people who didn't like President Thieu. There were
                    dissidents whose importance in the South Vietnamese political picture was vastly
                    exaggerated by their American supporters. The groups with some real political
                    underpinnings were largely sectarian, and they supported the government in some
                    ways and opposed or pressed their sectarian interests in others. They were
                    groups like the Cao Dai, the Dai Viet, the Hoa Hao and various Buddhists. The
                    other so called “dissidents” of whom American liberals were so fond, and in whom
                    they professed to see hope for “reconciliation” with the North, were usually
                    people without any political base whatever. In some cases they were North
                    Vietnamese or Viet Cong agents.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Beyond the discussion of Thieu's position and stability, a
                        lot of comments have been made in this country about the degree of
                        corruption in South Vietnam. Was corruption as manifest as has been stated,
                        and was it a factor that so severely weakened the South Vietnamese cause
                        that there was not much hope for their being able to forestall the North
                        Vietnamese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: The answer to that, in short, is yes, there was some corruption in South
                    Vietnam. There is corruption in many other countries. There is corruption in
                    Vietnam today. Sometimes what we, according to our rules, call corruption is an
                    accepted practice in Asia or other parts of the world where it doesn't
                    necessarily go under that heading.</p>
                <p>A wartime situation always exacerbates corruption to a certain extent. It did so
                    in the United States in World War II. In Italy during World War II - I served
                    there - truck loads, even convoy loads of military supplies such as food and
                    gasoline disappeared into the black market at times.</p>
                <p>In Vietnam, the fact that you had a war going on, even a relatively low intensity
                    conflict in 1973 and most of 1974, didn't help the situation. But the notion
                    that “corruption” in the South was the reason for North Vietnam's victory, or
                    even a significant contributing factor, is sheer nonsense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we turn now to the South Vietnamese military.
                        There is a picture in some quarters in this country that the South
                        Vietnamese Army was really not very good. Corruption again is mentioned in
                        this respect. It certainly did not have the reputation that the South Korean
                        military had. The picture, if one goes back far enough, is of American
                        troops having to do the whole thing in the days when we were involved, the
                        South Vietnamese weren't so good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>On the other hand, there have been other reports to the contrary, that the South
                    Vietnamese had built up their military, that they did have some very good
                    troops.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>What if the ammunition problem and the resupply problem had not been so
                    difficult? What if the South Vietnamese had indeed been getting a steady stream
                    of equipment and ammunition and supplies from the United States? Would they have
                    been capable of sustaining themselves against the awesome North Vietnamese
                    Army?</p>
                <p>LEHMANN: The bottom line on that one is that the ARVN, as well as the Vietnamese
                    Air Force and Navy, performed just about like other military forces including,
                    incidentally, the ROKs during the Korean war. Some times the performance was
                    very good, at times not so good and at others average. That, by the way is also
                    the judgement of General Bruce Palmer in his book, “The 25 Year War.” The most
                    professional, authoritative account of the military action from January 1973 to
                    the end on April 30, 1975, including the ARVN's performance is contained in a
                    publication of the U.S. Army's Center of Military History entitled “Vietnam from
                    Cease-Fire to Capitulation” written by former Colonel Bill Le Gro who was with
                    us in Vietnam during my entire tour there.</p>
                <p>Over the years of “Vietnamization”, the South Vietnamese military had become
                    increasingly capable of doing the job for themselves and confident of their
                    ability to do so.</p>
                <p>I go back now to the North Vietnamese Spring Offense, the so-called Easter
                    Offensive, in 1972, the one I referred to earlier when talking about the Soviet
                    role. There was very severe fighting in Military Region I, up around Quang Tri.
                    Initially, the South Vietnamese were indeed driven back and defeated, but they
                    managed to recover the position eventually. Admittedly, they did so with
                    substantial American air support, but it was only American air support. The
                    ground fighting was done by the South Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>From that time on until the Paris agreements came into effect eight months later,
                    virtually all the fighting, again with the occasional exception of U.S. air
                    support, was done by the South Vietnamese and very effectively.</p>
                <p>When the Paris agreements were about to come into effect in January of 1973, the
                    North Vietnamese attempted a major land grabbing operation in an effort to get
                    control of as much key territory as possible. A major event took place in the
                    northern part of the Mekong Delta, when the North Vietnamese attacked and
                    briefly occupied the town of Tan Chau, which is an active agricultural rural and
                    commercial center close to the Cambodian border in the northern part of the
                    Delta. Well, that effort was dealt with entirely by the South Vietnamese, who
                    defeated the North Vietnamese and reoccupied all South Vietnamese territory in
                    that area.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>After the Paris agreements came into effect, in that period of low intensity
                    conflict throughout 1973 and at least for the first nine months of 1974, the
                    ARVN basically contained the enemy, which -in theory anyway - was all they were
                    permitted to do. Occasionally the North Vietnamese would make a little headway
                    and occasionally the South Vietnamese would make a little headway. One place,
                    for example, that I'm personally very familiar with were the Seven Mountains, an
                    area very close to the Cambodian border in the Delta where the North Vietnamese
                    had garrisoned a fairly substantial force in very rough mountainous terrain
                    honeycombed with caves. Well, eventually, the South Vietnamese Rangers just
                    about completely destroyed them, taking quite heavy casualties themselves. There
                    are many other examples of that kind.</p>
                <p>Later on, when the full scale North Vietnamese offensive finally began, there
                    were repeated instances, all the way close towards the end in late April 1975,
                    notably at Xuan Loc, where the South Vietnamese Army fought with splendid
                    courage and determination.</p>
                <p>The North Vietnamese militarily defeated the South in 1975, not because the South
                    Vietnamese were unable or unwilling to fight, but because Hanoi disposed
                    overwhelming military force, equipped with a panoply of modern weapons and
                    transport, skillfully led with the aid of sophisticated command and control
                    facilities and amply resupplied, in good part through Cambodia by courtesy of
                    the U.S. Congress. In addition, the North Vietnamese had the advantage of the
                    initiative. They could pick and choose and concentrate forces, while the South
                    was forced to scatter its forces throughout the difficult topography from Quang
                    Tri in the north to Ca Mau 800 miles to the south. Last, and by no means least,
                    as the realization set in that they were being abandoned by the United States,
                    the South Vietnamese military became increasingly demoralized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because they were getting no support and were undercut by
                        the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: We shipped in a few artillery pieces and unloaded them with much
                    publicity, but that was all too transparent as a ploy and made no impression at
                    all on Hanoi. The all too evident reality was that Saigon was being undercut by
                    the United States. There were certain things that happened at that late period
                    that increased demoralization in the South by orders of magnitude. For example,
                    sometime in March 1975, Senator Mathias brought in a resolution in the United
                    States Senate calling for an immediate end to all further assistance of any kind
                    to South Vietnam. That had a devastating psychological effect at a very late
                    stage in the game. The Vietnamese, like many other foreigners, have some
                    difficulty understanding our political system. All they could see was a
                    Republican senator, allegedly on the side of the administration, bringing in
                    that kind of resolution and coming at the very moment when the South Vietnamese
                    were making their last attempt to try and save a truncated Republic of Vietnam.
                    The Mathias Resolution was psychologically devastating.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This interview is being conducted to interview Wolf
                        Lehmann concerning the last few months of the American presence in South
                        Vietnam. Mr. Lehmann was deputy chief of mission during this period, as
                        well, of course, as charg� d'affaires during the absences of Ambassador
                        Graham Martin. An earlier interview with Mr. Lehmann covered a longer period
                        dating back to Mr. Lehmann's arrival in Vietnam in June of 1973 and was more
                        of a broad perspective concerning his and the embassy's views of that entire
                        period including analysis of the chain of events and policies that lead to
                        the fall of South Vietnam. This interview, by contrast, covers the last
                        month or two and focuses on the disaster itself and on the evacuation of
                        Americans and others. The focus is on Mr. Lehmann's role and activities both
                        as charg� and as deputy to the ambassador.Before beginning my questions, let
                        me state several major background facts against which this interview plays.
                        As for Mr. Lehmann himself, he was initial consul general in Can Tho from
                        June of 1973 to March of 1974, and DCM from March of 1974 until his
                        evacuation from the embassy roof on April 30, 1975. The other facts briefly
                        are: the fall of Ban Me Thuot in the highlands on March 12; the beginning of
                        the chain of North Vietnamese victories in the rapid, final intensive;
                        retreat of the ARVN from the highlands over the next two weeks; the fall of
                        Da Nang on the coast on March 30; rapid NVA advanced south; President Ky's
                        resignation on April 22; encirclement and attacks on Saigon's perimeter on
                        April 28-29; and completion of the U.S. evacuation on the morning of April
                        30. Other dates and events can be cited, but the above skeleton is stated as
                        a guide to the listener in following this final story. It is a period of
                        only six or seven weeks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Mr. Lehmann, you were a charg� from March 2 until March 28, a period that
                    coincides with the successful North Vietnamese offensive in the highlands. Why
                    was Ambassador Martin away at this time?</p>
                <p>LEHMANN: As you mentioned briefly, we had had a very large-scale and extensive
                    visit by the large congressional delegation beginning about February 24 with
                    Congressman McCloskey and Bartlett. This was followed by a delegation headed by
                    Congressman Flynn which included about half a dozen others including such
                    luminaries as Bella Abzug and Congressman Fraser, who is the present mayor of
                    Minneapolis. That delegation, which was a sort of last effort to secure some
                    congressional support for what the President and the Executive Branch wanted to
                    do, left late on the evening of Sunday, March 2, and Ambassador Martin left
                    along with them to return to Washington. His main purpose in going back to
                    Washington was to do what he possibly could in a last effort to try and salvage
                    something out of the Vietnam situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How unexpected was the fall of Ban Me Thuot and also
                        President Ky's quick decision after that to withdraw from the
                        highlands?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>LEHMANN: First, it is significant to note that, while the congressional
                    delegation that I mentioned was in the country, the North Vietnamese had in fact
                    stood down their offensive operations. The military situation during the entire
                    stay of that delegation was quiescent. The North Vietnamese offensive operations
                    resumed two days after the congressional delegation left on March 4, 1975. The
                    main effort of the new NVA offensive was in the central highlands. It involved
                    not only Ban Me Thuot incidentally, but also Pleiku and Kontum which are
                    somewhat farther north than the highlands.</p>
                <p>As far as the operation towards Ban Me Thuot was concerned, it was extremely
                    competently done by the North Vietnamese. Their security was excellent and the
                    sudden attack on Ban Me Thuot itself came as a considerable surprise, especially
                    as to the force behind the attack to both the Vietnamese and ourselves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were any Americans or foreigners in Ban Me Thuot when this
                        attack came?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Yes. We had our provincial representative, an AID officer named Paul
                    Struharik, in Ban Me Thuot at the time. There were also a few other foreigners.
                    I believe there were one or two Canadians and perhaps an Australian in addition,
                    incidentally, to the ICCS detachment which consisted solely of a Hungarian and a
                    Pole and none of the others. As I mentioned, the rapidity with which the attack
                    on Ban Me Thuot itself took place did take everybody by some surprise, and the
                    people I mentioned, including Struharik, were captured by the North Vietnamese.
                    It took us several weeks, but the ICCS eventually affected the return of
                    Struharik as well as the other foreigners there. What happened to the Pole and
                    Hungarian I don't know. I presume they joined their friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that there were also North Vietnamese
                        attacks on places further north in the highlands, notably Pleiku and Kontum.
                        What was happening there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: The North Vietnamese operations of that area were also within days after
                    the congressional delegation left. Pleiku and Kontum—places where we had
                    Americans—were, of course, increasingly in danger. We, for our part, did not
                    want to take precipitant action, however, in moving both our American employees
                    and our Vietnamese employees that we had there out too early because we did not
                    want to be responsible for setting off panic and a change of events that would
                    no longer be controlled. However, on Saturday, March 15, within about thirty
                    minutes after I had returned from a meeting with President Ky at the palace, it
                    became obvious from reports that I had from Consul General Monty Spear in Nha
                    Trang and other information that we had at the embassy that we needed to get our
                    people out of Pleiku and Kontum. Therefore, that morning I instructed Jacobson,
                    our special assistant for field operations, and Spear in Nha Trang to remove our
                    people immediately from both places, and that operation was completed before the
                    day was out.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>Incidentally, as far as Washington was concerned, all I did is inform Washington
                    that I had directed the evacuation and it would be completed before the end of a
                    day. I did not ask them for any permission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they comment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: They made no comment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there an ICCS group somewhere in the area as well?
                        Did he take any action regarding them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Yes. There was an ICCS group. It consisted at that time only of
                    Hungarians and Poles. It did not have any Indonesians or Iranian representatives
                    in that particular location. The question of whether we should warn the ICCS
                    group or not was raised in the embassy with me. After giving it some thought, I
                    decided that no warning to the Hungarians and Poles was indicated, to just let
                    them sit there and do the best they can when their friends would arrive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They presumably were getting better information than you
                        were anyway, maybe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Perhaps they were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand that, on the basis of the sudden North
                        Vietnamese successes in the highlands, particularly at Ban Me Thuot,
                        President Thieu decided as early as Friday, March 14, that a total retreat
                        out of the highlands would be necessary in order to shorten lines,
                        particularly in view of the fact that American material and ammunition was
                        no longer forthcoming. That was on March 14. You just mentioned that you met
                        with President Thieu on the morning of Saturday, March 15, at nine o'clock.
                        Did President Thieu say anything to you at that time concerning this
                        decision?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>LEHMANN: That's quite correct. The decision to withdraw from the highlands—in
                    fact, the decision to withdraw from most of the northern part of the Republic of
                    Vietnam—was made by Thieu and conveyed to his corps commander on Friday at a
                    meeting in Nha Trang on March 14. When I met with President Thieu at nine
                    o'clock the following Saturday morning, he did not directly inform me of that
                    decision, but he hinted that a major decision was in the process of being made
                    and that it had been a rather difficult one. I could not draw him out on the
                    details. However, what he did say set a slight alarm bell ringing in my head as
                    I left the palace and returned to the embassy. It was on my return that I was
                    informed by Consul General Spear in Nha Trang that Two Corps had decided to
                    evacuate its forward headquarters at Pleiku and at Kontum. That, in turn,
                    precipitated my decision then to immediately evacuate the Americans and
                    Vietnamese employees that we had in the area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you assume that the word from Consul General Spear
                        connected with the incident President Thieu had just given?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Yes, I did. I might add something here. The question is sometimes raised
                    whether that was a proper way for a president to deal with us and whether I was
                    not considerably annoyed by the fact that he had not directly and clearly
                    conveyed this decision to me that Saturday morning. My feeling about that is
                    that, in light of the fact that we were letting the whole side down, he had a
                    right to make his own decisions. Since we were nevertheless able to do what we
                    had to do with regard to our own people and our own employees, there was no
                    cause for me to be particularly resentful by that particular mission on the part
                    of the president.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There have been criticisms of the Thieu decision to
                        withdraw. I won't go into that in any detail since we have covered that in
                        our earlier interview—covered that as the South Vietnamese belief that it
                        cannot hold all of South Vietnam given the cutoff of United States material
                        and ammunition. But, there have also been many criticisms of a more tactical
                        nature on the disastrous retreat from Pleiku down to the coast and the
                        alleged incompetence and irresponsibilities of Vietnamese generals. Do you
                        believe that better preparation, including perhaps better briefing by
                        President Thieu of his generals, would have made a significant
                        difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: It might and might not have. There is no doubt about the fact that the
                    decision was made very rapidly and implemented without any adequate preparation.
                    On the other hand, if Thieu had left more preparation time between decision day
                    and implementation day, there was a very, very strong chance, if not a
                    likelihood, that all of this would have leaked promptly to the North Vietnamese
                    through their very extensive intelligence apparatus that they maintained. I do
                    not know the answer to the question of whether better preparations would have
                    resulted in a more effective operation or not.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>As it was, and as you said, there was little if any preparation. The whole move
                    was set in motion literally from one day to the next almost from hour to hour.
                    It involved not only the withdrawal of South Vietnamese troops but in many cases
                    their families and, of course, endless numbers of other civilian refugees who
                    also clogged the very limited roads and highways that led from the highlands
                    down to the coast. So that was one of the elements that made it a very difficult
                    operation.</p>
                <p>The second element that made it a disaster or a near disaster was the inadequate
                    state of the single road, Route 7B, that led to the coast and along which the
                    withdrawal took place. The road was in bad shape. It was inadequate. There were
                    places where bridges were missing and had to be reconstructed by engineers all
                    of which took time. Meanwhile, all this traffic consisting of masses of
                    withdrawing troop as well as masses of refugees was backed up. Clearly, had
                    there been good plans and preparations, it would have included getting that road
                    in shape and getting it secured.</p>
                <p>Then there was a third element and that was the very highly sophisticated and
                    excellent command control and intelligence system over which the North
                    Vietnamese disposed in their attack. Contrary to popular impressions in this
                    country, this was not a guerilla war. This was a main force war in which the
                    North Vietnamese not only had excellent intelligence but excellent command and
                    control communications. So they were able to observe all this, come to very
                    rapid conclusions as to the state of the South Vietnamese forces, and take very
                    effective military action in order to largely destroy those forces as they were
                    deploying to the coast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We cannot affect the issue from the standpoint of material
                        and U. S. assistance since that had already been denied from Washington. Was
                        there anything we did not do that we might have done to influence South
                        Vietnamese decision making? I'm thinking here not so much of Washington but
                        U. N. Ambassador Martin primarily. Would Thieu have listened to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: I think the first answer to that question is that we were certainly in
                    no position whatsoever to advise Thieu to make another decision rather than the
                    one that he did make to in effect evacuate the entire northern part of the
                    Republic of South Vietnam and attempt to hold a truncated South Vietnam along
                    the line running roughly from Da Lat to the coast in the east. Would he have
                    listened to us had we done so? I rather doubt it, but as I say we were in no
                    position to give any advice.</p>
                <p>There is one other point that ought to be made. The concept of trying to hold
                    militarily a truncated South Vietnam along the line that I just mentioned from
                    Da Lat to the coast was not one that was invented at that particular moment.
                    That idea had been raised years earlier and it had occasionally been pressed by
                    an Australian advisor to President Thieu.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think I know who that was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Yes. Desmond. So it was not a totally new thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's switch now to embassy evacuation planning,
                        organization, and morale. How good was the basic embassy E &amp; E plan and
                        also the plans of the four consulate generals? To what degree had they been
                        updated to take into account the possibility of a sudden South Vietnamese
                        collapse? It must have appeared increasingly likely as the perceived U. S.
                        abandonment of its ally became clear. I am referring not just to the
                        detailed written plan but to the very consultations between you and
                        respective consul generals and also with the leading embassy players.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: I think the basic embassy evacuation plans were sound, in effect, in
                    fact. We'll get to that later with the final helicopter rotary wing lift out of
                    Saigon was option four on the embassy's evacuation plan. Other options in the
                    plan were in general outline a while earlier. The evacuation plans are, of
                    course, normally kept under more or less constant review. That review was
                    intensified in our case early in 1975. As early as February 20, we had a couple
                    of Marine colonels come in from the military side which was to support the
                    evacuation in order to review the details for evacuation planning right on the
                    ground and make any necessary adjustments that might be made. Of course, at that
                    stage of the game, we kept this very, very quiet. We did not tell anybody—didn't
                    want to tell anybody—for reasons which are obvious. We can get into them—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you didn't want to demoralize the South Vietnamese
                        government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Into them later on. As I said, as early as latter part of February, the
                    military began to review their role in the plans right on the ground.</p>
                <p>With regard to the consulates, yes, the plans were also constantly reviewed. In
                    one case, that of the consulate general in Can Tho, the plan was rather
                    drastically changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's in the south.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>LEHMANN: Yes, in the Delta where I had been previous to coming to Saigon as
                    deputy ambassador. As a result of one of the reviews, Terry McNamara, who had
                    replaced me, came up to Saigon at one point in March with a recommendation that
                    in Can Tho in the Delta we switch from an air evacuation plan to a boat
                    evacuation plan from Can Tho down the Bassac River into the South China Sea.
                    After a review by us at the embassy, that change was approved and that is the
                    way it eventually went, as a matter of fact, in April when Can Tho had to be
                    evacuated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume also that at the same time you were in steady
                        consultation with the other major section heads and other players in the
                        embassy that were involved in emergency planning.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Yes, of course we were. I was constantly talking to them. The situation
                    we faced beginning with the resumption of large-scale North Vietnamese
                    operations had, of course, several components. One of these was evacuation
                    planning for Americans. A related one was evacuation planning for some third
                    country nationals whose potential evacuation would support. A third element was
                    our role in dealing with the massive refugee situation that was created by the
                    resumption of North Vietnamese military operations.</p>
                <p>Basically, I organized the embassy in the following way. I designated the deputy
                    AID director, John Bennett, to be the principal focal point in the embassy for
                    supporting Vietnamese efforts to deal with the refugee situation. I designated
                    George Jacobson, who is well known to Vietnam hands and whose title was special
                    assistant for field operations, to be the principal focal point for supporting
                    evacuation planning by the consulates in our field operations. I designated the
                    defense attach�, General Homer Smith, to begin planning for the control of
                    overall evacuation from Vietnam, to begin planning support operations for an
                    eventual overall evacuation of South Vietnam. That was done by establishing an
                    evacuation control center in the defense attach� compound out atTon Son Nhut. We
                    ostensibly set up that control center initially to support the Vietnamese
                    refugee problem, but we did it with full knowledge and intent that that control
                    center would be immediately convertible into a center for controlling the
                    evacuation of Americans and others from the country as a whole.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the date?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Yes. It was on April 1 that we activated the evacuation control center
                    at the defense attach� compound.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As we move through the latter part of March and into April
                        and through April, the North Vietnamese forces are, of course, pursuing the
                        demoralized South Vietnamese as they retreat out of the highlands to the
                        coast—not only eastward but southward. Could you describe the evacuations of
                        the three consulate generals as they began to take place, starting with Da
                        Nang and moving on through Nha Trang, etc. What happened at each and when
                        did it happen? I remember descriptions of great chaos—and also further north
                        at Hue and Da Nang—and considerable heroism as well on the part of a number
                        of the Americans involved.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: To set the stage, on March 16 the ARVN evacuated Quang Tri in the far
                    north. We had no one in Quang Tri. Immediately after the evacuation of Quang
                    Tri, of course, the situation became critical in Hue, just a little bit to the
                    south. At that time, Theresa Tull was acting principal officer in Da Nang and Al
                    Francis was just about to return to his post. The initial step we took in Hue is
                    that we removed our people overnight only and brought them back into Hue during
                    the daytime. We did that for several days until the situation had clearly
                    reached the point where we could no longer do that if we didn't want to risk
                    them. Therefore, on March 18 I instructed Tull to move the people completely out
                    of Hue and keep them in Da Nang.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there many involved in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: No. There were not many involved in this. There were only a few
                    Americans and maybe a small number of Vietnamese employees. In that little short
                    interim period, in order to keep up appearance, we would bring them in in the
                    morning, go to their offices, bring them back to Da Nang by helicopter at
                    night—until March 18.</p>
                <p>On March 20 the ARVN organized their perimeter defense of Da Nang. The situation
                    in Da Nang was, undoubtedly, the most critical one in this entire story. The
                    ARVN on their part made a strong effort to evacuate the most effective combat
                    units by sea down to the south and the Saigon area so that the units could be
                    employed elsewhere in the war. As usual, the situation was complicated by, of
                    course, the presence of large numbers of families that were simply part of the
                    picture of the Vietnamese military. Then, of course, it was complicated by
                    massive flows of panicky civilian refugees.</p>
                <p>So the situation in Da Nang rather quickly got out of hand. The Vietnamese
                    military lost control of the Da Nang airfield which was simply overrun by
                    refugees and by some troops that had left their units. That, of course,
                    eventually complicated our own evacuation problem. Bear in mind now, overland
                    evacuation to the south was no longer feasible. It either had to be by air or by
                    sea.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>I considered in consultation with Francis, with whom I continued to have good
                    communications until the very last moment and with whom I was regularly on the
                    phone during the day and late into the night, the possibility of asking for
                    support from the American military to assist us in evacuation of not only
                    Americans and American employees but others from Da Nang. The specific proposal
                    we had in mind was for the Pacific command to furnish helicopters to be based at
                    Cam Ranh Bay for supplying and to, in effect, assist with a rotary airlift from
                    the Da Nang area. I raised that with the Pacific command and it was turned down.
                    The reason cited why they could not help with the operation was that all their
                    assets were standing by and had to stand by for the evacuation of Phnom
                    Penh—”Operation Eagle Pull” as it was called—and they could not divert it to
                    assist us in our problem in Da Nang. So that was abandoned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They did not have the resources for both.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: That's correct. They said they could not do both and they could not
                    divert anything from “Eagle Pull” as the Cambodian evacuation was called. So
                    that one fell by the wayside. We had earlier augmented the consulate general in
                    Da Nang with several younger active officers to help Francis and the whole
                    operation to our taking out of Da Nang, of course, the supernumeraries and
                    others who could not be immediately employed in the immediate problem. By the
                    evening of March 26 and early March 27, the situation was pretty well out of
                    hand in Da Nang. The airfield was no longer operational because it was just
                    overrun by mobs. On the evening of Thursday, March 27, I met with the prime
                    minister regarding the situation. He communicated with General Truong in my
                    presence—although it was in Vietnamese and I did not follow it—to explore the
                    possibility of using what remained of functioning military units, primarily
                    ranger battalions, up in Da Nang to reassert control of the airfield so that
                    some sort of airlift out of Vietnam could be continued. It became evident during
                    the night and in the early morning that that could not be done.</p>
                <p>My situation was further complicated that, during the night of March 27 to 28,
                    Ambassador Martin returned along with General Wyand. They were supposed to
                    arrive early in the evening of the 27th. Due to technical problems with the
                    aircraft, they didn't arrive until three o'clock in the morning of Friday, March
                    28. I met them there. I had an early morning conference at four in the morning
                    with Ambassador Martin to brief him on the situation, returned directly from
                    there to the embassy with the situation in Da Nang completely out of hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been pretty exhausting as well.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>LEHMANN: Yes, somewhat. I was running on adrenalin at that point. Up in Da Nang,
                    meanwhile, while we knew where the few remaining Americans and some more
                    Vietnamese employees were, we had lost track of Francis, the consul general.
                    Sometime during that Friday morning or midday, I found out through Vietnamese
                    channels that Francis, who had gone off to one part of the Da Nang perimeter,
                    was apparently on board a Vietnamese naval ship—a frigate or something of that
                    kind that was also loaded with soldiers and refugees—but no longer in touch with
                    the rest of his people who, at this point, were on a barge in Da Nang harbor.
                    This was the remainder of our staff and Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That includes Terry Tull, I presume.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: No. Terry Tull had gone for some time. The fellow on the barge in charge
                    was Brunson McKinley. Our communicators were able to patch me through to Brunson
                    McKinley on the barge. Now, McKinley didn't know where Francis was and wanted to
                    wait and get hold of Francis to get him back. I, knowing more about Francis'
                    whereabouts, instructed McKinley at that time that, if he had all the rest of
                    the people, to get out of there and leave. That was the end of the evacuation of
                    Da Nang on Friday afternoon, March 28.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to Francis now that he's on this other
                        ship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: He stayed on that other ship which eventually came down to the south
                    either to Saigon or Vung Tau. The people on the barge also made it out and came
                    down, a few of them with nothing more than the shirts on their backs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Nha Trang which came next? That's where Monty
                        Spear was as consul general.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Yes. Nha Trang was, of course, the next place to be threatened. It was
                    farther south, just midway down the coast between Quang Tri (and the so called
                    DMZ) and Saigon. Again, in Nha Trang it was question of moving in time but not
                    before time in order not to aggravate the situation and make it even worse. At
                    one point around March 27, the station chief came to me with what he said was
                    very hard intelligence that Nha Trang had, in fact, been surrounded and that we
                    had to move out of there immediately. That was not confirmable by any other
                    information that we had through other channels. So late one evening I had Spear
                    fly down from Nha Trang to discuss the situation with me very quickly. Although
                    the station insisted that its intelligence was correct, I came to the conclusion
                    that it was incorrect. I turned out to be right because a little bit later I had
                    a somewhat red-faced station chief come in to tell me that apparently they had
                    been had on something.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>However, within days thereafter the situation had reached the point where Nha
                    Trang had to be evacuated and the evacuation was, in fact, carried out and
                    completed on April 1 both by helicopter lift and some assistance from a
                    Philippine ship offshore that took off some refugees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said a helicopter lift. Was the Pacific command
                        involved in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: No. All this time the only air assets that we had available and were
                    used were our own Air America, both the small fixed-wing aircraft and the
                    helicopters that we had. There were no U. S. military involved in any of these
                    operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How large a group of aircraft did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: I don't remember exactly how many aircraft we had. We had both
                    helicopters, Hueys, and some fixed-wing aircraft, porters—</p>
                <p>LEHMANN: We had about 30 aircraft available to us in Air America. Of course,
                    under the arrangement that I described earlier, George Jacobson was the one with
                    overall supervisory responsibility for allocating those aircraft when we needed
                    them to support the evacuation operations as well as other ongoing operations at
                    the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, that is two of the consulates. Bien Hoa, which
                        is not very far north of Saigon, would come up next as we see the North
                        Vietnamese forces moving further south and threatening Saigon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Bien Hoa evacuation was basically handled through Saigon because Bien
                    Hoa was rather close to Saigon. At some point in the game—it was rather late
                    [and] must have been around April 19,—we had, in effect, closed down the Bien
                    Hoa consulate and moved the people to be evacuated into Saigon and had them
                    evacuated through the Saigon operation which was already in progress at the
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul general there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: The consul general was Dick Peters and I do not recall exactly when we
                    had Dick actually leave. But, we designated Dick to go to Guam to assist in Guam
                    with the handling of the Vietnamese evacuees, many of whom we were temporarily
                    parking in Guam. We didn't have any authority to move them to the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then there was Can Tho, of course, in the south and
                        presumably less immediately threatened by the broad offensive but also
                        vulnerable by the general collapse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: It is important to note here that the ARVN and the Vietnamese
                    governmental structure kept control of the delta right to the end. So the
                    evacuation of Can Tho took place concurrently with the evacuation of the embassy
                    in Saigon. They were given the word early on April 29 when we began execution of
                    option four of Frequent Winds to complete their evacuation. Now, it is true that
                    we had previously thinned out the staff in Can Tho already during the preceding
                    weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, as I recall from what you had said earlier, that
                        evacuation was carried out by sea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: The remainder of the evacuation was carried out by sea with the
                    remainder of the staff—Americans and Vietnamese remaining, going down the Bassac
                    River and out into the South China Sea where they were picked up by the
                    Navy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned Dick Peters having been sent to Guam to
                        supervise the flow of Vietnamese refugees out of Vietnam already. Could you
                        discuss a bit the degree to which this was taking place, the numbers
                        involved, the pressures involved, and some of the issues that may have come
                        up? Why were they going to Guam? Were they staying there and was there any
                        prospect of their going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: We had, of course, various categories of Vietnamese whose evacuation we
                    wanted to support. In some cases we were obligated to support. The principal
                    categories were: our employees; people who had worked closely with us; people
                    who were at very high risk if they were captured by the Vietnamese; and the
                    large numbers of Vietnamese who had established—with the many years of our
                    involvement—some sort of relationship with Americans, either through marriage
                    legalized by civil authority or clergy, or through common law relationships. The
                    Vietnamese extended family system—that sort of thing translates immediately into
                    fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, and cousins. So there was a massive
                    potential problem here of evacuating Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>At the same time, we had a situation where our authority to formally admit people
                    to the United States was extremely limited and subject to the normal kind of
                    consular procedures. We did not receive formal authority to exceed those normal
                    procedures and, in fact, evacuate Vietnamese to the United States under the
                    Attorney General's parole program until April 26, three days before the final
                    evacuation. Yet, we had these other problems on our hands.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>On April 17, for example, we already evacuated all Vietnamese employees of the
                    defense-attach� system who were in sensitive jobs and who had to be gotten out.
                    There were other folks in those categories. One of the main problems, of course,
                    was where do you put some of these people that you had no authority for sending
                    to the United States. Guam was, of course, a territory and so Guam was used
                    extensively as a temporary holding area while Washington sorted out some of the
                    legal and political problems that were involved. Shortly after we began really
                    evacuating large numbers of people largely by C-130 aircraft from the military
                    to Guam, it turned out that some of them wanted to come back because they had
                    left their families behind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I might interject here that I was on a visit to Guam a
                        couple of months after this with a large congressional delegation headed by
                        Congressman Lester Wolf, and we visited the camps there. There were huge
                        numbers. One thing that really struck me was that, in addition to those that
                        were clamoring to go to the United States, there was also a sizable group
                        that was clamoring to return to Vietnam in order to ingratiate themselves
                        with the new authorities. The new Communist authorities were putting up
                        slogans and making all kinds of anti-American statements in order to try to
                        prove that they had credentials to get back and would not be treated harshly
                        when they did return. It was a mess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Yes. I can imagine it was. At the time, somewhat earlier when we were
                    still in Saigon and those last remaining ten days or so, the guidance that we
                    gave to our people in Guam was, “If any Vietnamese wanted to go back, make that
                    a matter of record and back-load them on the empty C-130s that were going back
                    to Vietnam to pick up more.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking particularly about Saigon but also the overall
                        evacuation of Vietnam, I know there were considerable inhibitions in
                        carrying out the evacuation because, in particular, there was the strong
                        possibility that the South Vietnamese might look on this as the desertion of
                        an ally and who knows what their reaction might be. Could you discuss these
                        inhibitions as well as the degree to which they seemed justified in
                        retrospect in the light of experience and the passage of time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>LEHMANN: I think there were basically three factors in considering the final
                    evacuation and the process of getting ready for the final evacuation. The first
                    was that we had to avoid at all costs a repetition on a much larger scale by
                    orders of magnitude of the kind of mob panic that we had in Da Nang under much
                    more serious and much more complicated circumstances which would have been the
                    ones in the Saigon area. We were able to extract all our people out of Da Nang
                    in the end including our Vietnamese employees because it was important that we
                    were able to get them off on the ships, on the barges. We couldn't have done
                    that in Saigon. We couldn't have gotten them on the ships down the Saigon River.
                    In fact, we looked at that option in some detail. Hank Woodrow, an
                    administrative counselor, and I went over that possible option in considerable
                    detail including surveying an area at Newport in Saigon as a possible holding
                    area right next to the port. We dismissed that one as not being practical. We
                    had to avoid a mass panic in the city of Saigon because a mass panic in the city
                    of Saigon would have made shambles out of the whole process and would have made
                    it impossible to do what we finally did when we put into effect option four of
                    Frequent Winds which was the final helicopter airlift out of the city and nearby
                    area.</p>
                <p>Secondly and related to the first consideration was the fact that we had some
                    intelligence indicating that there were at least some senior ARVN people who
                    were seriously considering taking action to prevent us from evacuating, thus
                    having us go down with them. I do have one specifically in mind and I'm not
                    going to mention him because I know where he is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is he in this country now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: He was at one point. He was a senior officer who seriously considered
                    interfering with the American evacuation on the theory that, “If we're going to
                    go down, you are going to go down with us.”</p>
                <p>Having this whole American experience in Vietnam end in some sort of a violent
                    conflict between us and the South Vietnamese was, frankly, just too horrible a
                    thing to contemplate. The most serious consideration was the one of things
                    simply getting out of hand in Saigon.</p>
                <p>The third consideration was a political one. We did want to keep open, as long as
                    we possible could, the option of retaining some sort of official presence in the
                    area in the event there would be some sort of negotiated settlement involving
                    the North Vietnamese. This was a possibility that would have served the North
                    Vietnamese interests very well had they decided to go through with it because it
                    would have set up tremendous pressures in the United States to make good on what
                    they've always alleged were commitments that Nixon and Kissinger made to them
                    for assistance to Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Incidentally, Phil Habib and Bob Miller in that period
                        asked me to write up a feasibility paper. I did that but I didn't think much
                        of it. It was kind of hard. I really didn't know enough about it for one
                        thing. I remember mulling over that a couple of days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Well, that's an interesting note, Bob, and to expand a little bit on
                    that—it was not only our own thought that this was an option, we had guidance
                    from the Department to maintain that as an option including the possibility of a
                    very small skeleton staff at the embassy which, had that ever come about,
                    incidentally, would have probably been myself with about three or four other
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd be sticking your neck out, of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: That's right. It was just not our own thing. In the press and some
                    political circles, a good deal was made of this particular consideration later
                    on in a very distorted way. We were accused of dragging our feet and having
                    illusions, etc. This is all nonsense. In any event, that thing never, never
                    governed our evacuation operations at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We knew in Washington that this was a far out option. We
                        just wanted to be sure we looked at everything.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: It didn't drive our evacuation effort. That proceeded on its own. These
                    were the three main factors that we had to contend with, all of which, of
                    course, drove us to make what planning and preparations we had very quietly,
                    often pretending we were doing something else and not doing what we were really
                    doing. The trouble with this, of course, was that this exposed us to a lot of
                    criticism from the press and some politicians. Oddly enough, usually the
                    politicians were largely at fault, in any event, of getting us to the point at
                    which we were. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Perhaps it would be best now if you told in your own words
                        the phases, more or less, by which people left—a lot of voluntary
                        departures, I suppose, exiting of dependents, phasing down. How practical
                        was that in light of the posturing you needed to convey to the Vietnamese as
                        well as the willingness, I gather, of many Americans, especially unofficial
                        Americans, to leave.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>LEHMANN: As I mentioned, on the first of April we activated the evacuation
                    control center at the defense attach� compound, ostensibly at the time to
                    monitor the refugee flow situation. But, it was in full recognition and with the
                    intention of getting this facility ready to control the evacuation of Americans
                    and Vietnamese in the end. We began to draw down people in the first two weeks
                    of April by encouraging contractors to depart by sending out a number of
                    dependents, family members, and some nonessential personal under various
                    pretexts of one sort or another. In fact, we began in a sense ordering the
                    evacuation on about April 3 or 4. One of the things that was done—it was not the
                    only one—was that we had the so called orphan lift beginning at that time. We
                    designated large numbers of especially women and others—not only women but other
                    nonessential personnel—as escorts for the orphans, far in excess of what was
                    really needed but that was just a subterfuge to get them out. Of course, one of
                    the great tragedies of that particular situation was that one of the very first
                    flights crashed on April 4, 1975, with substantial casualties of both the
                    orphans and the so called escorts. It was a very sad thing and one of the
                    saddest moments of my life.</p>
                <p>With regard to official American personnel, I had already requested earlier in
                    March two things from the Department. One was not to have any additional family
                    members come into the country of people being transferred into the country. You
                    must remember that we had an American staff country-wide of all U. S. agencies
                    of about 2,000 people. That was granted, incidentally. That was approved and
                    there was no trouble on that one. But, the other authority asked for was
                    authority for us in Saigon to determine who should go out immediately without
                    further reference to Washington. I never got that. That apparently doesn't fit
                    the bureaucratic system, but it was the kind of leeway that we needed. In
                    Washington they kept insisting they had to approve each thing which was a
                    nuisance to put it mildly.</p>
                <p>However, to get back to the main point. We used the subterfuges such as I've
                    mentioned. We tried to encourage people to leave and reduce the number of
                    Americans in the country. On April 15 our evacuee holding facility at the
                    defense attach� compound went operational. As I mentioned earlier, on April 17 a
                    number of sensitive local employees—most of those with intelligence agencies and
                    related operations including the defense attach�—were evacuated. On April 21 we
                    began around-the-clock C-141 and C-130 flights in and out of Tan Son Nhut going
                    mostly to the Philippines and to some other destinations. Between April 4 and
                    April 27 about 27,000 people were actually moved out of Vietnam. Most of these
                    were moved by military MAC flights to either Guam or the Philippines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were mostly Vietnamese.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>LEHMANN: These were a mixture of Americans and Vietnamese and this is an
                    important point. One of the greatest difficulties that we had was the
                    considerable reluctance of many Americans to leave, especially American
                    contractor personnel. There were a lot of military retirees who had settled down
                    with Vietnamese “families” over the years. All of these people were extremely
                    reluctant to leave without their families. Now, in many cases these family
                    relationships were not legally blessed. They were simply common law
                    relationships but still very strong. But, there was no legal authority under
                    which we could evacuate or take these people into the United States. Moreover,
                    the family relationships were extended ones because they not only involved the
                    common law wife and the common law children but also the mother, the father, the
                    brothers, the sisters, and often cousins. Nobody wanted to leave without the
                    other. Yet, we had no way by which we had any authority to bring these people
                    into the United States and, of course, none to bring them into the Philippines
                    who happened to have an independent government. This was the kind of problem
                    that we were faced with. When we're talking about an average family here, we're
                    probably talking of a family of at least a dozen and sometimes more.</p>
                <p>That was only part of the problem. The additional problem was that, while we
                    wanted to send Americans out, Americans kept coming in and there was no way to
                    stop them. Americans kept coming in including, incidentally, some official
                    Americans and some Foreign Service officers. They kept coming in and looking for
                    their friends and acquaintances or their relations. In many of these cases they
                    had North Vietnamese wives and now they were coming in because they wanted to do
                    something to get their wives' parents, brothers, sisters, etc., out under some
                    sort of expedited procedures. So we were having a situation where we were
                    keeping track of the number of Americans in country and we were moving out
                    Americans, but the total number at any given day wouldn't really go down because
                    others would come in. This was a situation which is probably of somewhat
                    unparalleled difficulty. At least, I don't know the precedent for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's probably no country where we've been so closely
                        involved over such a long period of time where the numbers of Americans were
                        so great. Therefore, the number of involvements were so great. You didn't
                        have this in the Iranian evacuation, for example. They were limited. This is
                        a kind of unique experience. In fact, you didn't have this in Cambodia. It
                        is totally different.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: That's right. The Cambodian evacuation, I think, consisted of less than
                    400 people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. You knew it was a much cleaner kind of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Yes. Possibly.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Incidentally, what was happening with various third
                        country nationals? There must have been a lot of South Koreans, Japanese,
                        British, French, etc. Were they making arrangements for themselves or were
                        they asking us for help, and to what degree could we help them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Most of them were making arrangements for themselves. However, they were
                    in very close touch with us daily during those last weeks and last month and a
                    half. I had either DCMs or charg�s or ambassadors contact me wanting to know
                    what our view was and getting our appraisal so that they could decide what they
                    would do. The British moved out on their own at the time. So did the Australians
                    as well as the Israelis, the Belgians, the Dutch representatives and the
                    Germans. They moved out on their own.</p>
                <p>There were a few left that we took out with us on the last day including the
                    Italian ambassador, a very fine fellow. We were good friends. We brought him out
                    along with some U. N. people and a couple of other third nationals. Just who
                    they were escapes me. The Japanese made a decision to remain although they cut
                    their staff down very much. They remained which turned out to be rather helpful.
                    The Chinese—that's the Taiwan Chinese—left on their own. The Koreans left, and
                    it was a problem because there were a number of South Koreans that were left in
                    the country on April 29. We evacuated some of them. Unfortunately, a number of
                    Koreans were in that very last batch of evacuees along with some Vietnamese that
                    we had in the embassy compound when it was shut down and they remained behind.
                    That is always something that made me feel very badly, but we were simply told
                    that we had no more and that was it. Eventually, that problem was solved with
                    the help of the Japanese who had remained. The French also remained.</p>
                <p>There was one amusing incident with regard to third country nationals,
                    incidentally. I believe it was in the early afternoon of April 29 when we were
                    already in the process of executing the final evacuation. I had a call from the
                    Polish ICCS representative in Saigon who was very concerned about his situation
                    and asked if we might do something to help him. I was sorely tempted at the
                    time—like an attractive auction—but there was real difficulty which was due to
                    the fact that he was located some distance away from Tan Son Nhut and the
                    embassy. At that particular time the situation in the city was beginning to get
                    chaotic. I would have had to tell General Smith to dispatch some sort of detail,
                    including some Marines and some transportation, to go and pick him up. That was
                    too much of a risk under the existing situation. So I told him there was nothing
                    I could do for him. He'd just have to stay where he was and await the arrival of
                    the North Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before the final evacuation on April 29 and 30, were there
                        any significant problems between the mission in Saigon and Washington or
                        other agencies in Washington and the field?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>LEHMANN: There were a number of problems that arose. Some were of lesser
                    significance than others. One of the early problems that arose was when, on
                    March 25, I requested authority from Washington to move dependents to safe
                    havens in Manila, Bangkok, and other places on our own authority as I saw fit in
                    Saigon. Well, that was never granted. The Department insisted on bureaucratic
                    review back in Washington. That kind of thing is not suitable to this sort of
                    situation. However, we managed to live with it.</p>
                <p>I suppose a more serious problem arose during the latter part of April because of
                    tremendous pressures, political pressures in Washington for us to speed things
                    up and to do things which we on the ground knew would have catastrophic results
                    if we did so. Obviously, the Department and the rest of the Executive Branch was
                    under considerable pressure from politicians up on the hill and others. We felt
                    that pressure, but we just simply had to resist it. But, that was a rather
                    serious problem.</p>
                <p>A third problem, of course, was one I mentioned earlier regarding the evacuation
                    of Vietnamese. We did not receive authority to move any Vietnamese under
                    extraordinary procedures to the United States until April 25 or 26. Up until
                    that time we were theoretically constrained to those who were eligible for visas
                    which, of course, was wives and children of American citizens and that was
                    all.</p>
                <p>Another category of problems arose on a couple of occasions when there was a need
                    for urgent action—really urgent action. The main problem that arose in that
                    connection was when sometime in early or mid April—and I cannot remember
                    when—the FAA regional office in Honolulu, without a word to anybody, suddenly
                    declared Tan Son Nhut airport no longer safe for American commercial aircraft.
                    This came just at a time when I was still heavily engaged in trying to hold Pan
                    Am's feet to the fire to keep flying. It was also quite unjustified because,
                    when that was done, the situation in the general area of the airfield had not
                    changed from what it had been for a couple of year before that. Apparently, the
                    FAA decision was based on some questionable intelligence assessment which they
                    received from PACAF, Pacific U. S. Air Force Command, in Honolulu. This was just
                    the kind of thing, the moment it became public, that would set off a panic. If I
                    had called the State Department, a committee would have met the next morning and
                    started discussing this. So I just simply bypassed it. I called the NSC staff in
                    the White House directly and demanded the recision within hours, and I got it.
                    There were a couple of instances of that kind.</p>
                <p>In connection with other agencies, I mentioned that Pan Am, fairly early in the
                    game, wanted to discontinue their operations and Hank Woodrow and I had to put a
                    good deal of pressure on the airline to have them continue. I admit they had a
                    real problem because they would be way overbooked on their daily flights out of
                    Saigon. Then, when flight time came, there would be a lot of empty spaces
                    because there were simply no shuttles, or people were booking seats on the
                    airplane that didn't have the exit documentation. Nevertheless, it was important
                    to keep them flying.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>I had a similar problem with Flying Tigers whom we also had to pressure to keep
                    flying. They did not respond and stopped when they decided they had to.</p>
                <p>One last problem, not a significant one, that arose was with the Seventh Day
                    Adventist Hospital. That hospital provided basically medical support for the
                    whole American community. I was told at some point—I think it was again around
                    mid April—that they wanted to pull out. So I along with Woodrow and Dustin who
                    was our medical officer went out to see the Seventh Day Adventists and persuaded
                    them to remain. That was very important to us because there was in the
                    background, of course, always the possibility of casualties and that was our
                    medical support. But, that problem was resolved satisfactorily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They stayed right up to the end?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: They remained very close to the end, and even on the last day they were
                    still functional, although largely with a small Vietnamese skeleton staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was obviously a time of considerable distress on the
                        staff. How did the staff perform as a whole? Were there any particular
                        problems that arose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Let me say first of all that the overall performance of the staff was
                    great. It was just terrific. Everybody worked hard, long hours under great
                    personal stress and did a great job. We tried to recognize that in an awards
                    program that, in fact, was not completed until early 1976. I think we generally
                    managed to do so. One omission about that program that bothers me to this day is
                    that after I, acting as chairman of an awards board here in Washington—I came
                    back from Frankfurt for that purpose with several others—had completed the
                    program, I gave to Director General Carol Laise a well-considered, small list of
                    senior staff officers who had not been included in the program. They had, along
                    with me, constituted the board. I pointed out in that note that I gave her that
                    any omissions on that list were quite deliberate but that I thought the
                    performance of these other officers—I had them by name across the mission, not
                    just State—ought to be recognized. That was never done. I was told later on that
                    someone else took it up with the director general and was told that considering
                    awards for those senior staff officers would raise the questions of the
                    ambassador, the DCM, and that those were political issues. So that never took
                    place.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>As regards to the staff performance as a whole, whenever you have a tremendously
                    large number of Americans on the staff as we had in Vietnam under conditions
                    like that you are bound to have an occasional problem. We did have to rather
                    promptly relieve one fairly senior military officer and had him depart because
                    he jumped the gun and disobeyed instructions. We had problems with two or three
                    other people throughout this very large staff. That's very minor, really—one or
                    two who simply couldn't take it and had to be ordered out.</p>
                <p>We had one problem with one member of the senior staff who had been a disruptive
                    influence in the mission for some time before that. I will not go much farther
                    than that. In retrospect, we should have sent the gentleman on back to the
                    United States some months before that since he was the subject of complaints to
                    me of virtually every other member of the senior staff at various points. But,
                    we did not do that. That, I think, is a lesson for the future. If anybody is
                    ever in a situation of that kind, he should identify personnel problems of that
                    nature early in the stage and, no matter how tough it is, take action.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these substantive points of difference or were they
                        related to rough personal relationships to people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: They were partly substantive in nature and they were in large measure
                    related to ways of operating and running the mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we continue with discussing the evacuation, it
                        might be useful to record just what happened to President Thieu. When did he
                        resign? What was our role? What did we do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: After some exchanges of communications between ourselves and Washington,
                    Ambassador Martin went to see Thieu on April 20. The details of that
                    conversation are recorded in the traffic and I don't know to what extent that
                    traffic has been released or not. However, in general I can say that what he
                    told Thieu was that the decision as to what to do was, of course, entirely up to
                    him. But, if he should decide to resign, we would assist him and get him, his
                    family, and a small number of his close assistants into a safe haven. Thieu
                    resigned on April 22, two days later announcing that resignation in a very
                    bitter speech. I do not blame him for being bitter, incidentally. He had a right
                    to be. He resigned that day. Two days later on April 24 we had arranged for a
                    special U. S. aircraft at the airport to take him and his family and a few
                    assistants to Taipei.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We discussed the situation regarding the evacuation of
                        people—American, Vietnamese, and third country nationals. What was done with
                        regard to sensitive materials—classified records, etc.? I understand there
                        also was a problem regarding the nuclear research reactor at Da Lat.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>LEHMANN: We began packing and sending out embassy files and records at the
                    beginning of April or maybe it was even early March. This was the kind of thing
                    that we could do quietly. Nobody would see that. Things could be packed up in
                    the communications room and shipped out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were going all the way back to the United
                        States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: They were going all the way back to the United States. We also, for
                    example, had the bubble that had to be gotten out. That's a rather large and
                    unwieldy thing and, of course, that was a visible act. Most people really don't
                    know when they see big pieces of plastic lying around in the courtyard, so that
                    was sent out. Whatever documents that were not sent out at the time or taken out
                    by us individually along in our briefcases towards the end were destroyed,
                    including some during the night of April 29 to April 30. In any event,
                    everything was either sent out or destroyed. Nothing fell into anybody's hands.
                    This was not a Tehran situation. [Laughter] I get rather upset every once in a
                    while when I still read stories about the situation in Tehran having the
                    greatest intelligence loss since the evacuation of the embassy in Saigon. We
                    didn't lose anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything lost in the consulate generals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: No. Also the same applies to the consulate generals. The consulates had
                    either sent back or, in their cases, mostly destroyed all their files and
                    records. That's true for all four of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then Da Lat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: There was a research reactor in Da Lat, so called Triga reactor that had
                    been part of the USAID program many years before. After Tet 1968, there was some
                    nervousness in certain circles in Washington about fuel elements of that
                    reactor. I recall distinctly then when I was director of the office of atomic
                    energy as well as others in the State Department being approached by the Atomic
                    Energy Commission to get those fuel elements out of at the time. Ambassador
                    Bunker quite correctly just ignored that nonsense. In any event, we did want to
                    get the fuel out in April of 1975. Again, it was one of those things where we
                    wanted to act in time but not before time.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>For about a week before we finally decided—and I did—to move those fuel elements,
                    there were a couple of special C-130 aircraft standing by at Clarke Field in the
                    Philippines with technicians and the equipment necessary to pull the fuel
                    elements out of that small reactor. I finally permitted them to come in and go
                    ahead with that. I believe it must have been around mid April. Then we did
                    preserve the proper forms in all of this as much as I asked the Vietnamese
                    government to give me a formal letter requesting that we remove the fuel
                    elements, and they did so. It was a slightly hectic operation. The NVA was
                    beginning to approach the area. This was in the highlands, of course. It took
                    all night, but it was done and properly done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are now coming down to the final period before the
                        evacuation and, particularly, to that last weekend. This is the period of
                        Friday, April 25, to Monday, April 28. How did the situation evolve during
                        those days, and what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: First of all, let's keep in mind that at this point we had been
                    operating around the clock C-141 and C-130 flights from the airport since
                    Monday, April 2l. In the middle of that week and the latter part of that week a
                    kind of a lull set in on the battlefield. There wasn't much by way of North
                    Vietnamese offensive action.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were close to Saigon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: But, they were beginning to approach Saigon. It was shortly after that a
                    rather tough battle at Xuan Loc where the ARVN had really distinguished
                    themselves and fought very well, indeed. At that time there was, of course, some
                    speculation as to the reason for that lull. There are two possibilities. One was
                    that it reflected a political decision in Hanoi to have the whole business end
                    in some form as an ostensible government of national reconciliation which they
                    always said they had wanted. This would have been, of course, a complete
                    farce—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the idea of negotiating with people who were neutral
                        or had that reputation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: With the idea of negotiating with Minh who had replaced Thieu. He was,
                    therefore, from their standpoint the ideal candidate with whom to negotiate this
                    charade or farce.</p>
                <p>The other possibility, of course, was that, having conducted extensive offensive
                    operations, they simply had a logistical problem and needed to regroup and
                    reorganize. There is still a third possibility that it was a combination of both
                    of those things. In any event, the first option I mentioned, if it was ever
                    considered, was dismissed. In retrospect it is probably evident that the lull
                    was due to a need to regroup, reorganize and look after their logistics.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If they had had some resistance from the ARVN elements
                        that had fought a bit more than people thought, perhaps.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Yes. That certainly is so. However, none of this affected our evacuation
                    operations which, as I said, continued. On Thursday I decided that the time had
                    come for us to evacuate the last of the wives which were simply the wives of a
                    senior officers including my own, Hank Woodrow's wife, Nancy Bennett, the wife
                    of the political counselor, and one other lady and two children which we still
                    had. They were the children of the divorced consular officer, Peter Orr, whom we
                    had to retain because we needed him in our operation. I also had Mrs. Martin on
                    that list but her name was deleted by the ambassador. In order to do this we had
                    the Army send in a U-21 from Thailand because we didn't want to have the
                    departure of the senior wives noted out where most of the evacuation was taking
                    place. We also needed to maintain the fiction that they were simply going to
                    Bangkok for an extended weekend. That was done on Friday, April 25.</p>
                <p>The lull, as I mentioned, did continue through Sunday, April 27. Beginning on
                    Monday morning, April 28, it became quite clear early on that the North
                    Vietnamese were actively resuming their offensive operations. At about six
                    o'clock in the late afternoon on Monday, April 28, a number of A-37 aircraft,
                    obviously manned either by North Vietnamese or defecting South Vietnamese
                    pilots, attacked the flight lines at the Tan Son Nhut airport.</p>
                <p>At the time that occurred, I had just gone out of my office and gone out into the
                    second courtyard of the embassy in the area where the swimming pool and the
                    snack bar was located. I had gone there to straighten out the problem that was
                    reported to me about having buses with evacuees leave from there to go to the
                    airport. This was an area where we were assembling evacuees to bus them to the
                    airport. I was told there was a problem of a delay and I had gone out to look
                    after that just at the time that that air strike in Tan Son Nhut took place.
                    Now, there have been some rather lurid accounts of that particular event. When
                    the strike took place, it precipitated a certain amount of quite unnecessary
                    rushing around and a bit of upset. I might note parenthetically here that, being
                    a veteran of the Italian campaign of World War II including the Casino Line, the
                    Anzio Beachhead and quite a few other events, I can differentiate between the
                    difference of unfriendly high explosives coming down in your immediate vicinity
                    in which case you would have a very strong, direct personal interest, and
                    something that is happening a mile or two away. In that case you can afford to
                    take a detached professional interest in what is going on. This strike out at
                    Tan Son Nhut, lurid descriptions in some books to the contrary, was in the
                    latter category. It was quite a distance away. There was no immediate danger to
                    the embassy or anybody in the embassy. This did not prevent our very solicitous,
                    protective Marines from immediately surrounding the minister with weapons drawn
                    in order to protect him. This was very touching but it was somewhat
                    overdone.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This brings us to a side question of what was the system
                        on assembly areas and movement to the Tan San Nhut airport for final
                        evacuation? Obviously, you've indicated that the chancery itself was an
                        assembly area and that buses were picking up people there. Were there other
                        assembly areas and what was the plan of movement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: On April 15, sometime earlier, we had activated an evacuee holding
                    facility out at the DAO compound. The system was that anybody being evacuated by
                    fixed-wing aircraft—which, as I mentioned, were operating around the clock
                    beginning April 21—would come out there or be bussed out there either from the
                    embassy itself or from some other designated locations in town, notably staff
                    housing areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That system was still continuing at this late date?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: That was continuing at that late date until the air strike on the flight
                    line at Tan Son Nhut on Monday evening. The attack on the flight line in which
                    at least one C-130 was destroyed in effect ended the fixed-wing airlift.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was about what time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: The air strike took place at six o'clock in the evening. After we had
                    rather quickly assessed the situation and in the course of the next hour, a
                    decision was made that it would be too risky to continue fixed-wing operations
                    out of Tan Son Nhut because of the danger that we might lose an aircraft full of
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were people then brought back into the housing areas that
                        were already out there assembling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: The people that were out at the DAO compound remained there. The people
                    that were in the embassy at the time remained there for the time being. After we
                    had made the decision to discontinue fixed-wing operations, the rest of the
                    evening was taken up with reviewing the final plans for the increasing
                    likelihood but not yet a decision that we would have to go to a helicopter
                    evacuation—which is technically known as option four of Frequent Winds”—the
                    following day.</p>
                <p>That went on throughout the early evening. Shortly after midnight—the night from
                    Monday to Tuesday morning—the ambassador decided that he and I should return to
                    our residences and try to get some rest in view of the likelihood that a lot of
                    major and crucial decisions had to be made the next day. I got back to my house
                    between one o'clock and two o'clock in the morning. I tried to get some
                    sleep.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you know, I'm involved in going to embassies on crisis
                        management exercises. One of the things that I've stressed is—and this comes
                        up in the exercises—the extreme importance of fatigue in desperate
                        situations or critical situations and the need for people to consciously put
                        aside time to recharge their batteries no matter how the man is. This if
                        reflected in the last point that you were making about the ambassador's
                        decision that you and he needed to get some sleep and for some of the
                        others, too. I know earlier, too, at one point you mentioned having been
                        awake for some huge number of hours. It must be all through this that there
                        must have been the question of physical exhaustion confronting quite a
                        number of people but particularly the senior staff that were so heavily
                        engaged in the operation. Do you have any comments on what was done?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: I quite agree. That's important for all concerned to get some sort of
                    rest. Otherwise, they become useless. With regard to most of the staff, we had
                    earlier worked out a shift system. Because we had designated certain elements of
                    the mission to worry about various categories of potential evacuees—the defense
                    attach� to worry about the Vietnamese military, the political section to worry
                    about politicians, and other people to worry about relatives of Americans, etc.
                    These things had gone on a shift basis somewhat earlier so that nobody would
                    work more than about twelve hours or so. That was the attempt that was made.</p>
                <p>For the absolute senior staff, it was on a more irregular basis. You got what
                    rest whenever you could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was an attempt to get it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a good deal written at various times about the
                        large banyan tree that was located in the embassy courtyard and which became
                        a symbol of what was to be done. There had been a number of rather lurid
                        press accounts, for example, on the refusal of Ambassador Martin to agree to
                        the removal of that large tree. It indicated to some that the embassy was
                        out of touch with the realities of the situation, that the refusal to take
                        down the tree meant that they did not understand the evacuation might have
                        to occur and, obviously, the tree would have to come down if the helicopters
                        were to come in. The situation would be amenable to evacuation. What was the
                        real story?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>LEHMANN: The helicopter evacuation plan called for some of the helicopters to
                    land on the roof helipad and others—notably the rather heavy CA-53s that the
                    roof pad could not support—land in the courtyard of the embassy where this
                    famous, beautiful banyan tree was located. It always was obvious that, when push
                    came to shove, the tree would have to come down. One of the problems here,
                    however, was that the tree was not only large but it was also very visible from
                    the street. The streets were getting increasingly crowded as panic was beginning
                    to slowly develop in the city of Saigon. The removal of the tree would be a
                    visible act that would undoubtedly spread like wild fire throughout the
                    city.</p>
                <p>As I was returning from the outer courtyard and surrounded by my solicitous
                    Marines to go back to my office to assess the situation and try to find out just
                    what had happened out at Tan Son Nhut, I was passing the tree. As I was passing
                    the tree, one of our Seabees was vigorously but somewhat ineffectually chopping
                    away at the tree with an axe in what was quite clearly a self-initiated attempt
                    to clear the area for use as a helicopter landing zone. As I entered the embassy
                    chancery building, I billed the security officer to promptly have the Seabee
                    cease and desist from the rather ineffectual and somewhat premature efforts, to
                    bring in some power tools such as chain saws, etc., have them ready, but not to
                    take any action regarding the tree until instructed and until the time was
                    right. I then forgot about the tree and turned on to other things that we
                    discussed in response to an earlier question.</p>
                <p>As a matter of fact, I'm not sure that Graham Martin ever knew anything about the
                    tree. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've had your sleep now and are fairly rested. We're
                        brought up now to the early morning hours of Tuesday, April 29. What took
                        place then? When and how were the crucial decisions made?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: I didn't really get any sleep. I got to bed between one and two and
                    dozed off for a while. At about 4:15 A. M. I was roused from my dozing by a
                    series of explosions out in the direction of the Tan Son Nhut airfield and the
                    defense attach� compound. About ten minutes later at about 4:30 A. M. the phone
                    rang and the report—I don't recall now whether it was directly from the defense
                    attach� or from an officer at the embassy chancery—was that there had been a
                    rocket attack on the DAO compound and that two of the embassy Marine security
                    guards out there had been killed.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>That, of course, ended the rest period. I got up, showered, went down, and Mr.
                    Tui, my major domo and butler, gave me some breakfast. I packed some extra
                    underwear, an extra pair of socks and a couple of little things in my briefcase.
                    I had a last conversation with my butler who had previously told me that he did
                    not want to leave and wanted to remain. He was an elderly man. I made some final
                    arrangements with him to get some money to him in addition to money he had
                    already been given—that's dollars, not piasters. That money, incidentally, was
                    delivered later by Brunson McKinley and Bob Martin to him. After having a little
                    breakfast, I went back to the chancery. Ambassador Martin arrived from his
                    residence just a little bit later on. We jointly began to review the situation,
                    getting reports from General Smith out at Tan Son Nhut as to the details of the
                    rocket attack which intermittently continued throughout the area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they seem to be targeting the American compound there
                        or was this a general attack on the airport?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Other facilities were also being spotted, but it was the first time at a
                    little after four that morning that an attack appeared to be targeted
                    specifically on an American installation. The cause of the death of the two
                    Marines was a direct hit on the sandbag emplacement in which they were. It was
                    just one of those things.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Martin decided to go out to Tan Son Nhut and review the situation out
                    there personally with General Smith. While out there, he had a telephone
                    conversation with General Scowcroft back here in Washington which, however, did
                    not result as yet in a definite conclusion on whether or not we would continue
                    fixed-wing airlift rather than go to option four of the evacuation plan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was with the NSC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Yes. Brent Scowcroft. Ambassador Martin then returned to the embassy.
                    Meanwhile, it became very clear that damage to runways at the airfield and other
                    things made it quite impossible to continue a fixed-wing airlift. Ambassador
                    Martin then got on the telephone again, this time from the chancery, with
                    General Scowcroft. A decision to go to option four of Frequent Winds, the
                    helicopter airlift was made between 10:30 and 10:40 on Tuesday morning.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>The initial moves by helicopter directly out to the fleet were by Air America
                    helicopter. We were using Air America, our own helicopters, first in the morning
                    to move people from the assembly areas either to the embassy or to the DAO
                    holding facilities out at the airfield. Later on, we initially were using the
                    Air America helicopters to move evacuees directly out to the fleet. The plan
                    called for the Marine ground security force to arrive at the DAO compound at Tan
                    Son Nhut—which had priority on the evacuation under our plan—one hour after the
                    option four execute order was given. To illustrate that plans would go wrong,
                    the ground security force arrived three hours later and not one hour later. Of
                    course, the first helicopter evacuees, using fleet and Marine Corps helicopters,
                    were those same choppers that brought in the security force and then would lift
                    evacuees back out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was sometime in the afternoon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: This was between one and two in the afternoon. That delay cost us
                    something at the end of the whole operation. I found out much later that the
                    reason for that delay was that there had to be some cross-loading out at the
                    fleet to marry the Marines that were supposed to come in to secure both the DAO
                    compound and the embassy compound and were not the same ships as the helicopters
                    were. They had to move people around.</p>
                <p>By early or mid-afternoon, the embassy was surrounded by masses of people—mobs.
                    The security situation became increasingly risky. It was only with some
                    difficulty that we managed to get into the compound. Some people for whose
                    evacuation we had really special responsibilities—for example, Trang Kon Gu, the
                    leader of the Vietnamese Labor Federation, and his people; Mu Vien, the minister
                    of the interior; Tran Van Lam, the former foreign minister who had signed the
                    Paris agreement. Nonetheless, all this was accomplished, but the security
                    situation was really getting touchy. I, therefore, telephoned the General who
                    was out at the DAO compound and told him that we urgently needed about a platoon
                    of additional Marines in addition to our embassy guards in the compound in order
                    to maintain the security. These arrived about an hour later. The famous tree,
                    incidentally, had been removed and gotten out of the way well ahead of time.</p>
                <p>I was not in Ambassador Martin's office when he had the conversation with
                    Washington which resulted in the decision to execute the helicopter lift, but
                    several of the other senior staff people were. I was busy in my own office doing
                    various other things on the telephone. After the decision was made, Hank Woodrow
                    walked over into my office, told me the decision was made, and I went back to
                    see Graham Martin to have it confirmed to me directly. I then walked out and
                    told the security officer now to chop down that tree. The tree was chopped down
                    long before anybody was ready to arrive by helicopter in the embassy courtyard.
                    Timing was, indeed, quite adequate.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Incidentally, now that we're at the point where the mobs
                        are outside and the additional Marines are being brought or had just been
                        brought in from Tan Son Nhut, what was the situation in regard to the
                        dispositions of the American community? Were they all in the embassy
                        compound? Were some in the compound, some at Tan Son Nhut, and some in the
                        housing compounds, or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: By the time we're talking about, all Americans still in the area were
                    either at the DAO compound or in the embassy compound. A little bit earlier some
                    of the last ones, including some journalists, had arrived at the compound and
                    gotten through into the compound only with some difficulty to get through the
                    crowds. I should be quite accurate here. All those who wanted to leave—there was
                    one fellow, a contractor who turned out later on to somehow not get the word. It
                    was his own fault. He was left behind. Then, of course, there were a couple of
                    journalists who stayed on deliberately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time now we are getting the helicopter airlift
                        going. As I understand it, the people were being removed by helicopter to
                        two locations, both at Tan Son Nhut and from the embassy compound.
                        Presumably, in the latter, since the banyan tree was cut down, you would
                        have the larger helicopters landing in the courtyard and the smaller types
                        landing on the embassy roof. Is that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: The priority was evacuation from the DAO compound at Tan Son Nhut. So
                    most of the initial lift by helicopter went out of the DAO compound. That
                    operation was completed by 2000, 8:00 in the evening on Tuesday. On its
                    completion, General Smith and the few remaining DAO staff left a few minutes
                    after eight that evening. That ended that phase of the operation.</p>
                <p>Up until that time, we had relatively little lift out of the embassy compound. It
                    is correct, of course, that that lift—which was really only beginning in the
                    mid-afternoon out of the embassy compound—did involve the lighter helicopters,
                    the CH-46s—from the roof. The heavy ones, the CH-53s, were from the courtyard
                    where the famous banyan tree had previously been. We were putting as many as 70
                    people into a CH-53 which was overloading it somewhat. Since many of them were
                    Vietnamese, they were rather small—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Given the fact that you had these crowds—mobs,
                        even—outside the embassy gates and a great deal of pandemonium and confusion
                        going on, was there any effort by the mobs or people in them to interfere
                        with the landing of the CH-53 aircraft into the compound?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>LEHMANN: Not in any significant way. All these poor people were desperately
                    trying to do was to try to get into the compound with the hope that somehow they
                    might be taken out. There was an occasional shot fired from outside the
                    compound, but we could not really determine whether that was directed at an
                    incoming helicopter or not. In any event, it did not in any way interfere with
                    the operation. At this point, we did have enough Marines to secure both the
                    inner and the outer embassy compound, although occasionally someone might have
                    slipped in who shouldn't have. It did not affect anything.</p>
                <p>In the course of the evening—and I can't remember exactly when it was, but I
                    suspect it was around 8:30 or 9:00 in the evening—the military suggested that we
                    suspend further helicopter operations for the time being and resume them at
                    first light the next morning. The ambassador and I vetoed that very promptly and
                    insisted that we would have to continue the operation throughout the night. That
                    insistence was based on both what the intelligence were still able to gather
                    about the North Vietnamese—and there were some that were still available to
                    us—and on a judgement that the situation around the embassy, even with the
                    larger Marine detachment was becoming increasingly untenable.</p>
                <p>At that point we may have had somewhere between 1,000 and 1,500 people in the
                    compound, both American and Vietnamese with a heavy preponderance of Vietnamese.
                    During the night, therefore, the lift continued although at times there would be
                    long intervals which, in our view, were excessively long intervals between
                    arriving helicopters from the fleet. I understand, and I think we understood
                    then, that there were deep problems of refueling, fatigue of the crews, etc. But
                    it was clear that the operation definitely had to continue and could not be
                    stopped and resumed the next morning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to set up lights so they could see their way
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: There was no problem about that. They could see their way in. The
                    situation in the courtyard was dealt with by having embassy cars parked around
                    the perimeter of the courtyard with the headlights on. That illuminated the
                    courtyard situation which was a tricky thing for the pilots. It was very tricky
                    because of walls and antennas and other mass nearby that they had to get over
                    before they could clear the courtyard with their heavy loads.</p>
                <p>One of the things that became a matter of some concern is that sometime during
                    the time around midnight or a little bit later it began to rain just very
                    lightly. Remember, we were now in April and now at the beginning of the monsoon.
                    It began to rain very lightly, and the mere fact of water on the hulls of the
                    helicopters added to their weight. So we had one very critical moment where a
                    pilot with a load full of people tried to lift out of the courtyard and could
                    not get enough altitude. He had to put back down and they had to unload some
                    people off before he could get out.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They probably didn't want to get off.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: No. They did not want to get off. So that was a moment of great concern
                    because, if we had an accident in the courtyard with a broken helicopter, that
                    would have finished the lift out of the courtyard and we would have had to rely
                    entirely on the smaller choppers coming in on the roof.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many could they take out? Was there quite a
                        difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: There was quite a difference. As I said, we could put as many as 70
                    people in the CH-53s, and I think the maximum number of CH-46s might have been
                    about 40.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was about a two-to-one difference.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Close to two-to-one difference. At the same time, we were also
                    destroying a few last documents by burning up on the rooftop.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We continue on with this process. I guess the only thing
                        to ask before we get into the final last withdrawal is were you getting any
                        panic among the Vietnamese and also the Americans—all the people that were
                        still waiting their turn to leave as time went on? Were there priorities
                        among them? Were they waiting orderly, particularly since I know that some
                        people were left behind at the end? In other words, was this anticipated by
                        some of them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: No. There was no panic among any of the people. We had people waiting in
                    the courtyard. We had people waiting in the stairwell of the chancery building
                    to go up to the rooftop, but there was no panic. At one point, when we had
                    reduced the number still waiting to a more manageable proportion, we abandoned
                    the outer embassy courtyard—the area where the swimming pool, the snack bar and
                    the administrative section was—and removed everybody into the inner courtyard
                    which gave us also a smaller perimeter to protect against the crowd outside.</p>
                <p>As to priorities, well, you know, your priorities as far as we were concerned—the
                    first obligations, of course, to Americans. Certainly, the second was to any
                    high-risk Vietnamese, to our employees. But, we did not have a priority question
                    as such arise. The small group that in the end was left behind that I mentioned
                    earlier, largely due to the fact that the entire lift operation began about two
                    to three hours later than it should have, was a mix of Vietnamese and
                    Koreans.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's get down to the final hours and deep into the night.
                        I guess the final pull-out you mentioned was about six o'clock in the
                        morning. I recall that Ambassador Graham Martin went out before you,
                        apparently because of a direct order from the President to do so. Can you
                        get into the last few loads, you might say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: At about four o'clock in the morning, the ambassador and I went to the
                    remaining communications set-up, the last one. We sent our final message. The
                    date-time group of that message was 291215 Zulu which, of course, is Greenwich
                    time. The message said, “Plan to close mission about 0430, 30 April local time.
                    This is the last message from Embassy Saigon.”</p>
                <p>After that message was sent, the communicator disabled the communications set-up.
                    He did whatever he had to do to protect the remaining equipment. He got in line
                    to leave. We were not, however, out of communications because we still had a
                    link all the way back to Washington through the MACPAC radio of a Marine with
                    the Marine security force and the major commanding that force. After we sent the
                    message, there was really nothing much else for us to do. We waited while the
                    operation was continuing to try to get as many people out of the courtyard as
                    possible.</p>
                <p>At some time a little later—it might have been around 4:30—a very peremptory
                    message did come through direct from the White House where they were monitoring
                    the situation directing the ambassador and the remaining staff to leave by the
                    next helicopter. We considered that for a while and let the operation continue
                    still for a while longer. Finally, after some consultation between myself and
                    the Marine major, decided that the time had come for the ambassador and the rest
                    of us to leave. Initially, through an error we all went downstairs rather than
                    upstairs because the thought was we were going to leave on one of the bigger
                    helicopters. But, that was not to be. The ambassador and remaining staff trooped
                    on up to the rooftop where one CH-46 was just landing and another one was
                    hovering not far away. As the CH-46 landed, Ambassador Martin along with George
                    Jacobson, Tom Holgar, and a few others started walking towards the helicopter.
                    Some of the rest of us began to follow, but that crew chief knew when he had his
                    man. What his orders were, as soon as he got the ambassador on board, all the
                    people who have to be right along next to him. He waved the rest of us back and
                    the helicopter took off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not full, I gather.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>LEHMANN: Not entirely full. It had some other people on it. It had some remaining
                    mission warden guards on it who helped the control of all of this and a few
                    other people, but it was not entirely full. Shortly thereafter, the next CH-46
                    put down on the rooftop, and the rest of us—which included Hank Woodrow, Joe
                    Bennett, Brunson McKinley, Jim Devine, an officer named Jay Blowers, and the
                    last mission warden guards boarded that helicopter which became really very
                    jammed and crowded. We stayed up on the rooftop for about twenty to twenty-five
                    minutes because the Marine major, who was doing a very competent job of running
                    things out in the courtyard, was using the helicopter's radio to firm up his
                    final plans for extracting the Marine detachment which was the final step, of
                    course. So we sat there for about twenty minutes while he was working that out
                    over the radio. We lifted off according to my records at 5:20 in the
                    morning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You don't know the Marine officer's name by any chance, do
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Sorry. I should, but I don't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did it take to get out to the fleet and what
                        happened when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: It took about a half an hour or a little bit more—maybe about 45
                    minutes. As we were leaving the Saigon area, I could look out the helicopter and
                    I could see the approaching North Vietnamese columns with their headlights out
                    and beginning to enter the outskirts of the city. Our exit was covered by armed
                    aircraft from the fleet. That had been the case throughout this whole thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, there was no interference from the North
                        Vietnamese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: There was no interference. There was no attempt to interfere. I think
                    that was probably intentional. It took about 45 minutes to get out to the fleet.
                    Our helicopter landed on the Denver, which was an LPD, a landing platform dock.
                    It had Marines on it and assault boats and helicopters. The ambassador and those
                    with him, meanwhile, had gone out to the Blueridge, so we were separated at this
                    point. Arriving at the Denver, the first thing that the Navy made sure of was
                    that nobody had any weapons on them. I was deprived of one little mace thing
                    that I had with me. I think Woodrow was deprived of a revolver he had which I'm
                    not sure he ever recovered. Except for that, they were very solicitous and gave
                    us a lot of food to eat. They gave us an initially rather crowded place to
                    sleep, but that was sorted out later on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You stayed on the ship until it got to the
                        Philippines?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>LEHMANN: The fleet stayed out. After the evacuation was completed—the Marines,
                    incidentally, were extracted from the compound by about seven o'clock in the
                    morning or a little bit before, perhaps, moving up through the building
                    gradually and abandoning the courtyard which was immediately taken over by the
                    crowds. They took away typewriters and anything else they could find.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were no incidents in the Marine departure?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: There were no incidents, and there were no casualties of any kind
                    throughout except the two Marines that were killed early on in the day by that
                    direct hit which, I think, was quite an accomplishment.</p>
                <p>The fleet did not move out. The fleet remained on station, anchored out in the
                    South China Sea about 25 miles offshore or something like that for a number of
                    days. They picked up additional people—Vietnamese—coming out on boats and
                    barges. All told, about another 60,000 people came out on boats and barges while
                    the fleet stayed out there. They were largely put on some MSTS transports that
                    were with the fleet. I have forgotten just how long we stayed out there. I think
                    it was about three or four days before we sailed into Subic Bay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wolf, I believe we've covered the entire sequence from the
                        beginning, over a period of a month and a half to two months, up until the
                        final arrival of yourself and Ambassador Martin and the others at the fleet.
                        Probably, we've forgotten a few things here and there. One thing I remember,
                        for example, that I wanted to cover and didn't and that we might clean up is
                        how the warden system worked. We might also have another final point on the
                        total number of people that were involved in the evacuation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: The mission warden system worked pretty well. During the evacuation
                    period, we used the Americans in the mission warden system, largely either to
                    drive or escort buses—often to escort buses—that were bringing people from
                    assembly points either to the embassy or to the DAO holding facilities. At the
                    end, I mentioned earlier, at the end among the last to be evacuated were most of
                    these American mission warden guards. Of course, the warden system also had a
                    lot of Vietnamese guards that were under contract which, for example, provided
                    the guards at my house, etc. On the whole it worked well. There was a fatigue
                    factor at one point with the American mission warden guards. In fact, that
                    played a role on the problem that arose with moving the people from the embassy
                    to the DAO compound on Monday afternoon just before the 8:37 attack.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of people were these wardens? One thing that I
                        found in a somewhat similar situation was—and I always raise this in the
                        exercise that we hold—the importance of insuring that the wrong people were
                        not made wardens. In other words, you have to be very careful that senior
                        staff are not named wardens, people that would be occupied with other
                        things. So you are trying to get people that have good heads, are stable,
                        are not too emotional on the one hand but on the other hand also will have
                        the time to do this and not be pulled off to do other essential jobs that
                        are their primary responsibility.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Yes, I see what you mean. Of course, the thing that I was talking about
                    is a little bit different because these were full-time hired wardens that I was
                    talking about. As far as the people detailed from the normal mission stand as
                    wardens were concerned, we had that also, of course. We didn't encounter any
                    particular difficulties on that score, but perhaps that was so in our case
                    because it was a very large mission with an awful lot of people. We could insure
                    that the right people were selected and there weren't these overlaps. The same
                    kind of thing may not be true for an embassy or a mission of a much smaller size
                    [as it was for]the immense mission that we had in Saigon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we go on now to the number of people that were
                        involved.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: As to the number, we started with 5,886 U. S. Government personnel, U.
                    S. contractors, and dependents at about the first of March of 1975. Between
                    April 4 and April 24, we evacuated by commercial or military means a total of
                    27,000 people of all kinds—Vietnamese and third country nationals. Between the
                    April 25 and early on April 29—the crucial day—in those four days we evacuated
                    about another 27,000, mostly by military fixed-wing airlift—by far the largest
                    number. The helicopter lifts on the April 29 and into April 30 lifted about
                    7,500 out of the Saigon area. After that, another 14,000—almost all Vietnamese
                    with a few Americans—came out to the fleet by boats and barges generally in
                    conformity with the plans for the use of boats and barges.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these to a great extent out of MR-4?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: These were both MR-4 and MR-3, some from the nearby Saigon area. That
                    made a total of 75,500 approximately evacuated under the plan, either by air or
                    surface. In addition to those, another 60,000 Vietnamese came out to the fleet
                    in the course of the 29th and a few days thereafter that the fleet remained
                    anchored offshore. Those were largely by some form of surface transport—a boat
                    or a barge, etc. Included in that number is a relatively small number, largely
                    of Vietnamese military who came out with their own helicopters.</p>

                        enormous numbers came later, but that was a different situation. That was
                        not a part of this final evacuation, but it was the escape after the North
                        Vietnamese takeover had been completed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>LEHMANN: Yes, that was a completely different thing.</p>
