                <p>Interviewed by: Ann Miller Morin </p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Olmsted, would you tell us a little about your
                        family, their background and where they came from and so forth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: My family is of English-Scottish extraction. My father comes from an old
                    New England family, but he was born in Chattanooga, Tennessee, where his father
                    had gone in order to get away from the rigors of a cold climate.</p>
                <p>My mother's background was Scottish. She was born in Hastings, Minnesota, and her
                    parents were born in Missouri. They moved up the Mississippi River from Missouri
                    as children or young people. Her grandparents were born in Scotland and came to
                    this country to avoid the service in the King's Army.</p>
                <p>My parents met and married in northern Minnesota, where my father was an engineer
                    with the M.A. Hannah Company in the mines of northern Minnesota. He was a
                    graduate of the University of Illinois. My mother was teaching school there. She
                    was a graduate of Northwestern University. Her specialty was in the field of
                    speech, and she did a good deal of what they used to all elocution. At that time
                    she was teaching English and a few other subjects in the local high school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very good. You got an early start in having a model in
                        your mother, didn't you, as far as having your own career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, I think that's true. She had very much wanted to go on the old
                    Chautauqua [circuit]. Do you remember that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, indeed.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: But the illness of her mother prevented her from doing that, but she
                    always looked back on that as something she wanted very much to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Principally, I suppose her basic job was that of
                        homemaker, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, that's correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How large a family did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Only my brother and myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he older than you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, my brother was two and a half years older.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you brought up in any particular church? Was
                        religious training a great part of your background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: It was part of our background. My mother was an Episcopalian, my father
                    a Presbyterian, but they agreed that the children would be brought up as
                    Episcopalians, and so we were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you went to church all the time, and Sunday school,
                        that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, I went to Sunday school and to church.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned your maternal grandmother. Did she live with
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Let me think. I think she did when I was very, very small, but I don't
                    remember her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did grandparents play much of a part in your life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Not a great deal. The last of my four grandparents died when I was five
                    years old. Consequently, it's quite minimal.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about aunts and uncles, cousins?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Not very much. My mother's sister and her family lived in Duluth, where
                    I was born, and I knew them as a small child. But we moved away from Duluth when
                    I was three years old and moved down to my father's old home in Chattanooga.
                    Then when I was six, we moved to Florida, and that's where I grew up.
                    Consequently, I saw cousins and aunts and uncles on occasional holidays.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it really was a nuclear family that you grew up
                        in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your relationship with your brother? Did you
                        fight the way most children do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you try to emulate him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I don't know that I did. He was a sickly child, and I think I was
                    jealous of the amount of attention he got.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If he were sickly, you, I gather, had good health?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I had excellent health.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You probably didn't play with him very much, then, did
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Oh, yes, we played together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Quietly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the yard games and climbing trees and so forth,
                        which many children do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: We lived on the edge of the Indian River in Florida, and our childhood
                    games were focused a little more on water than they would have been under other
                    circumstances. We had boats, little boats, and things that children could play
                    in, and our friends had boats. So we did a good deal of swimming and boating and
                    that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you very interested in sports as a young girl?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, I'd say fairly interested. Yes, I liked being active.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you weren't a tomboy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Oh, I think I was, perhaps, maybe up until the time I was ten. Then I
                    started wearing glasses, and that seemed to inhibit my activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you weren't a “doll” girl.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No, I was not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any serious childhood illnesses?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your brother? Did he die at an early age?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No, no, he's still living. He wasn't an invalid. It's not that at all.
                    But when other people got colds, he had the flu. When other people got flu, he
                    had pneumonia. It was that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. A weakish constitution. And, of course, he was the
                        boy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In relation to your parents, would you say you were closer
                        to one than to the other?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: I think I was closer to my mother than to my father.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your father the strict prototype of a father?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: He was a little more—well, I'd say maybe a little austere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't get too close to him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Not terribly, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your mother teach you the things girls were supposed
                        to know—cooking, sewing, keeping house?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Not very much. Somewhat, but certainly I couldn't say that I learned a
                    great deal of cooking and housekeeping from her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your perception of their wishes for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I think my perception was that they expected me to have a career. I'm
                    not sure I could have articulated it that way as a child. It was expected I
                    would go to college and do something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a given?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did either of them try to persuade you in any one
                        particular field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about yourself? Did you have any early ambitions, or
                        did you just not know what you would do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: I was very interested in science at one point, and at one time I thought
                    I wanted to grow up and be a scientist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Oh, something in the natural sciences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose maybe living in Florida might have had something
                        to do with that. You have spoken of the water sports that you enjoyed. Did
                        you have any particular hobbies—stamp collecting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, I collected stamps. I read a good deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you an early reader?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. I guess I was; I'm not sure. What other things do children do?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We ruled out dolls, but you did like stamps and you did
                        like reading. Did you belong to the Girl Scouts or the 4-H?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I belonged to the Campfire Girls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For quite a while?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I suppose for three or four years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You really enjoyed that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. One of the teachers in high school was the leader of the Campfire
                    Girls, and she was a teacher who was liked. She took us on expeditions, and we
                    thought very well of her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were alone, what did you do? Did you play cards
                        with yourself or did you—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No, I read.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: No.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: In a place like Florida, where you can be outdoors so much of the year,
                    I think one's childhood is a little different—There were no little girls in my
                    neighborhood, and I played with three brothers who were about the ages of my
                    brother and myself. We played all the games kids play—roller skating. They had a
                    long cement driveway. We used to go roller skating on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they permit you to join in their games?</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about schooling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: School was easy for me when I was young. I grew up in a very small
                    community in a rural area of Florida, and the school standards were certainly
                    not high and the competition was not great, and I found school a breeze.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your brother, was he also a bright scholar?</hi>
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. I wouldn't say I wanted to follow them. I don't believe I ever was
                    interested in being a teacher, but my sixth grade teacher I liked very much.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Until I got into junior high school, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that the sort of system where you had a different

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Well, maybe one teacher for two subjects and another teacher for two
                    others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you began to branch out. Did you move to a bigger

                <p>OLMSTED: No. We were living in the same community.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I didn't know if they bused children.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: They did bus children as it was a very scattered area. The population
                    density was very low, and they had to have school buses. At first I took the
                    school bus to the elementary school in Titusville, and then later to the
                    junior-senior high school, which was about halfway between Titusville and the
                    community where I lived, called Indian River City.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Indian River would be near Melbourne?</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: North of Melbourne, but on that coast. Did your mother and
                        father seem to expect more of your brother than they did of you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I'm not sure I could answer that. Yes, I guess they did. I guess they
                    did.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you graduated from the local high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, and I liked history and I liked English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When it came time to go on to college, how did you decide
                        which one you'd go to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: My parents wanted me to go to New England to college. They thought that
                    the New England schools were better, the private colleges there were of a better
                    standard, and they also wanted me to have the experience of living in a
                    different part of the country, and coming into contact with people who were
                    different from our neighbors in rural Florida.</p>
                <p>So I sent away to get various college catalogs. I had a cousin who was three
                    years older, who had gone to Vassar and was in Vassar at the time I was
                    deciding. She was interested in having me go there. I studied the catalogs. As I
                    needed scholarship assistance that figured in, too, what different colleges
                    would offer. My grandmother and my great-grandmother had both gone to Mt.
                    Holyoke. Neither had graduated, but both had been students. That was in my
                    father's family. I think that was of interest to me. Consequently, I decided on
                    Mt. Holyoke.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Partially because it was a women's school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, but I think all the schools I applied for were women's schools. I
                    applied to Mt. Holyoke, Vassar, Wellesley, and it seems to me there was one
                    other, but I've forgotten.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you only interested in going to girls' schools?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I don't remember that I applied to any co-educational schools.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's interesting. Why do you think that was?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: Well, I think my parents encouraged me in doing it, thinking I would get
                    a better education in a women's college than a co-educational school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You already had the New England connection, of course,
                        through your father. You have said that the schooling that you had—that is
                        to say not that you had, but that the Florida educational system wasn't as
                        high.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to have any special extra help or outside
                        courses in order to get into Mt. Holyoke?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No. I have heard it said that they added an extra ten or fifteen points
                    to the scores of entering students from the South to reach a certain parity with
                    the others. I don't know whether that's true or not, but I wouldn't be
                    surprised. I took the Scholastic Aptitude Test.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were in high school, did you participate in
                        extracurricular activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I was in the senior play, and I played basketball for a little while. I
                    didn't really stick with basketball for very long.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Public speaking?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: We didn't have public speaking. Oh, yes, I wrote a column for the local
                    newspaper, which came out twice a week, on school activities.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No. No. He left the mining business when we left Minnesota. In
                    Tennessee, he was working as a building contractor, and then when we moved to
                    Florida, he retired, but bought a couple of citrus groves and he managed
                    them.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: (Laughter) I don't think I had one in the beginning. It was a subject
                    that I found interesting. I liked my teachers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. You picked for the professor, rather than for the

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No, I wouldn't really say that, but if I had not liked the professors, I
                    think I would probably not have gone into it. One doesn't give very much
                    thought, I think, to the future in choosing a major.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. But I was only a part-time student at Columbia. I was earning my

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of living were you earning in New York?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I got a job in a security analysis division of one of the big banks in
                    New York, Central Hanover Bank and Trust Company, as it was then called. It's
                    been merged and the name has been changed a couple of times since then. After I
                    worked there for a couple of years, I worked at the National Bureau of Economic
                    Research for a couple of years.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, I did that for a couple of years. I worked on the Mt. Holyoke News,
                    I think it was called. I was in the Dramatic Club. I was the stage manager for
                    Junior Show and I was in the Outing Club. Those, I think, were the principal
                    activities. I had to earn money while I was there. I waited on tables my first
                    year, and I lived in a cooperative dormitory my last three years. I had a job
                    doing clerical work in the office to earn spending money. That rather restricted
                    my time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, it is. Well, I was working downtown, so I was living about halfway.
                    Well, roughly halfway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you share an apartment with another girl?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Initially I did. Then she decided she would go back and live with her
                    parents, so then I had the place by myself.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Not terribly. Campus life was not at all important to me at that time. I
                    had a full-time job, and I was working very hard to keep my head above water.
                    I've forgotten now what I took, one or perhaps two courses. I think only one
                    course a semester. I can't remember. That fully occupied me. The fact that there
                    were midshipmen on the campus was just something that I saw and walked on.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Columbia was secondary to New York. You had a job
                        first, I presume. What did you study at Columbia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Economics. It was statistics, really.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You probably wouldn't have time, would you? Can you recall
                        if there was any impact on your thinking because of the war, on your future
                        activities and your philosophy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Not much that I was aware of at the time. Perhaps there was. Perhaps it
                    did increase my interest in foreign affairs. It's so hard to nail all that
                    down.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were not interested in becoming an officer yourself in

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No. I had no desire for a military career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was your first interest in the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Well, it came up quite by happenstance. I had decided that I was getting
                    tired of New York, and I decided I would like to do something different. I had
                    been at the National Bureau of Economic Research for a couple of years, and I
                    was getting tired of my job there.</p>
                <p>A friend of mine had gone down to Washington and had gotten a job with one of the
                    wartime agencies, and I don't remember which one. She wrote glowing letters
                    about how much she was enjoying Washington and so on. She suggested—or I may
                    have; I don't remember—that I should go down there and look around. So I did so,
                    and I stayed with her for several days and made the rounds of various places.
                    She brought back for my use, before I arrived, a number of the Form 57s. You
                    remember the old Form 57? That's what you filled out to get a government job. I
                    filled one of them. The first one I filled out was not very neat and tidy. It
                    was blotted, and I had crossed things out and so on.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>She had told me where she had heard they were hiring people, and one of the
                    places she said was the Department of State, because they were still taking
                    people into the Foreign Service Auxiliary. So I took the form that was the least
                    presentable down to the Department of State, because I felt they would not hire
                    me. I thought I had no chance as a woman getting into the Department of State,
                    but I thought the experience of having an interview in the government would be
                    useful. So I took my badly blotted form down there and was interviewed for an
                    assignment in the Foreign Service Auxiliary, and some weeks later, why, they
                    wrote me a letter offering me a job, to my great amazement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes! So that is how you happened to go to Montreal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. I was assigned as a junior economic analyst in the Foreign Service
                    Auxiliary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your parents? Did they applaud this decision of
                        yours?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Not really. I think they were a little taken aback by it. They thought
                    New York was entirely far enough away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to see your parents often at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I went home a couple of times a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, it was very difficult during the war to even
                        get on trains.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>So you were then a junior economic analyst in the Foreign Service Auxiliary. What
                    does a junior economic analyst do?</p>
                <p>OLMSTED: (Laughter) Whatever is needed in the economic section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you became an FSO (unclassified) in 1946.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: The Department said it was offering the Foreign Service examination in
                    the fall of 1945. I think it was November of 1945. I believe that was the first
                    post-war offering of the Foreign Service examination. They said anyone on the
                    rolls could take it and so on. This is the same examination that was offered to
                    military people. I took it in Montreal and passed it, and then I was told I
                    would have to go down to Washington and take the oral, and I arranged to do that
                    some months later. Of course, I took the examination in November and then it was
                    a few months before they told me that I had passed, and then another few months
                    before I went down there. So I believe it was in May that I took my oral
                    examination.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long was the exam that you took? Was that the
                        three-and-a-half-day one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: It was cut down to a two-day exam at the time I took it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Part of it was a language qualification, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I had an oral examination in Spanish. I can't remember now that there
                    was a written examination in Spanish. There may have been, but I must say my
                    mind is not clear on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went down to Washington, can you remember who was
                        on your Board? Are there any anecdotes you can remember from that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Francis Willis was one of the people who was on our board. And if I
                    thought long enough, I would remember the man who was chairman of it. He was an
                    ambassador, quite well along in years at the time.</p>
                <p>I stayed with the same friend with whom I had stayed when I went down to get my
                    original appointment, and I had a new dress and a new hat and a new hair-do for
                    the occasion. The examination was rather short, shorter than I had really
                    expected. It was in the late morning, and they said, “Go have lunch and come
                    back at two o'clock,” for the results of it.</p>
                <p>I came back, sat down at the desk of the man who had been the chairman of the
                    board, and he looked at me, he looked down, and I thought, “Oh, dear. He's going
                    to tell me that I failed it.” I was just feeling a wave of disappointment when
                    he looked up again and said, “Miss Olmsted, I want to congratulate you. You're
                    now a Foreign Service officer.” (Laughter) So I went out in a great wave of
                    triumph.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course! What sorts of things did they ask in those
                        days?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: V-J Day had taken place several months earlier, and they asked me what
                    kind of an economic program I would recommend for Japan following its defeat. It
                    seems to me they asked me something on the Middle East, but I can't remember
                    what it was. And some other questions. They asked me a couple of questions in
                    Spanish. My Spanish was not very good, but it was fully as good as the person
                    who was asking the questions. (Laughter) I got through that end of it all
                    right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you any idea what sort of things they were going to
                        ask you? Were you able to prepare for this at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Not really. Someone told me I should read the newspapers carefully and
                    keep up with current events and have some views on them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it perhaps more to see the way you comported
                        yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Once you were in the Foreign Service, you went to
                        Amsterdam. That is to say, once you were a Foreign Service Officer and not
                        Auxiliary. You went to Amsterdam as a consular officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No, I went there as an economic officer—commercial officer, I think the
                    name was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you did the consular along with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. There was a rotational program which was established at the request
                    of the four young officers who were in Amsterdam. Initially it was only the men
                    who were rotated. I said I wanted to be rotated, too, and after a little delay,
                    they agreed that I could be rotated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you the only woman?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. Another woman Foreign Service officer, whose name escapes me, had
                    been at Amsterdam somewhat before. She was one of the very early Foreign Service
                    officers. She had served at Amsterdam a long time ago and then had left the
                    Foreign Service, then come back during the wartime program and had been there
                    for, I think, a couple of years before I arrived there. I never met her.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were before the examining board, did they ask you
                        questions that seemed to have a sexual bias? In other words, did they say,
                        “Do you plan on a career or are you just going to work a little bit, then
                        get married?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Not as far as I can recall. Or they may have asked it in such an oblique
                    way that it didn't make much of an impression on me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure. Why the difference between when you were an
                        “unclassified” and when you became an 06? Were you on probation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No. “Unclassified” was the designation that was used prior to the
                    implementation of the Foreign Service Act of 1946. It was an automatic
                    switch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course. Back to '46. Then you went up to 05 very
                        quickly, didn't you? You moved on then to Reykjavik [Iceland]. Was that your
                        choice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were the political officer. You had already done
                        some political reporting, had you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not at all? When you were in Amsterdam, you were in two

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Three. First I was commercial officer, then I handled passports and
                    American citizens' affairs, and then I became a visa officer.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. I would have preferred staying in the political function.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were given no choice. Given your background, your
                        very strong background in economics, it made sense for the Department,
                        didn't it? But what about the language when you were in Reykjavik? What did
                        you use?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Used English, which is quite widely spoken. Icelandic is spoken only by
                    the small population of Iceland. English was the diplomatic language. No
                    question about that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you learn much Icelandic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Enough to make a few social remarks, greetings, thanks and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that with special lessons?</hi>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No. I think I'd had only a year or two in college and that was all.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: When I was first hired as a junior economic analyst, I was sent to the
                    old Foreign Service training school, and we had a six-weeks' course there which
                    was rather general in nature, as there were people going into different kinds of
                    work. Then when I became a Foreign Service officer, they did not bring me back
                    for additional training.</p>

                <p>

                <p>OLMSTED: (Laughter) Well, we had lectures from various people in the Department,
                    and I can't say I remember now very much of what I did learn.</p>
                <p>

                        later, but were you effectively in a cone when you went to Vienna?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. It seems to me the cone system was being put into effect in the
                    1950s, and perhaps even early '50s. I can remember saying, at least in the
                    mid-'50s to Personnel, that I would like to be assigned to political work, and
                    they said, “Oh, but you're in the economic cone.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was no way you could get out of it if you wanted the

                <p>OLMSTED: Well, they made it seem impossible. Let's put it that way.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you happen to be sent to Fletcher?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I had applied for Russian language and area training when I was in
                    Reykjavik. It was decided in the Department that I would not get the Russian
                    language and area training, because at that time they were not assigning women
                    FSOs to Moscow. Therefore, they weren't going to train them in Russian.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: You know the old prejudices. So instead, they assigned me for political
                    training at Fletcher [School of Law and Diplomacy, Tufts University].</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I was in Vienna at the time, and it did not affect me directly, but
                    indirectly it did, because there were a great many temporary appointees, people
                    who had been taken over from the military at the Embassy, which was combined. It
                    was the Office of the High Commissioner to Austria, as well as the Embassy. It
                    was USCOA/Embassy, or Embassy/USCOA. I've forgotten now. RIF was in the air, and
                    it impacted on the work that I was doing as I was picking up work that other
                    people had done but were being RIFed, that sort of thing. Morale was
                    terrible.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: I didn't worry about it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: When I was in Vienna, I was sent back to Washington to take the
                    mid-career officers' course. I had come back for home leave, and they kept me on
                    to take the mid-career officers' course. That's where I got a good dose of
                    McCarthyism and its impact on the Department. The man who was running the course
                    was fired because they didn't like some of his personal life.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, and it was certainly very much discussed at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Do you agree with certain other Foreign Service
                        officers that it had a devastating effect on the Department, that the
                        Department never really has recovered from it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I think that's probably true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You do agree with that? It never got over it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Well, it wasn't that so much as the feeling you want to play it safe.
                    Whatever it was, you want to play it safe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see what you mean. You were at Fletcher for one year. Is

                <p>OLMSTED: I didn't take the degree.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: Not what I was doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That lasted for a year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you enjoy it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No. When I was in Vienna, for the first year I was there, I was doing
                    commercial work. Actually, what I was spending most of my time doing was
                    bringing up to date things that had been neglected because of the pressures
                    resulting from the wartime status of Vienna. I was there during the four-power
                    occupation, during the time of a great deal of stress. A lot of work had been
                    neglected, things that were routinely sent out from the Department to be done.
                    So I was in the economic section, and I was given one backlog after another to
                    clean out, and it was pretty dull. I did it for a while, and I made it clear I
                    was getting pretty tired of it. So they were going to set up a new unit which
                    was to deal with the problems of the economic relations between Austria and the
                    Soviet bloc. They said I could be assigned to that new unit.</p>
                <p>When I came back from this mid-career course, that's where I was assigned, and I
                    had a very interesting job, which I enjoyed very much. However, I felt it had
                    run its course, and when I was in INR, they wanted me to continue in that line
                    of work. East-West trade is a broad term for it, but it was wearing thin at that
                    time. I felt that people were scratching around to hold on, that there had been
                    some empire building. People were trying to maintain their little empires. And
                    I'd had enough of it, and so I wanted to get out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then were detached to the Department of Commerce?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was at your choice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No. I had asked to go to the Department of Labor, and for reasons known
                    only to the personnel system, I was put in the Department of Commerce, which
                    came as very much of a surprise to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do over at Commerce?</hi>

                <p>OLMSTED: Writing for the Foreign Commerce Weekly and answering correspondence and
                    so on. I was working on Germany and Austria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm getting the feeling here that you were sort of shunted
                        around at this time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very definitely. Do you think it was because you were a

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Oh, that probably was one of the reasons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the reasons. You did not have a mentor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I did not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is true? You did not? Do you think it's essential to
                        have a mentor? You mentioned the empire building in the Department. Do you
                        think it's essential to have a mentor to help you get ahead and rise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Well, I'm sure it helps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not necessarily essential?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No, I wouldn't say necessarily essential. I don't think I've ever had a
                    mentor, and I survived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, yes, of course you did, and very well, too. But
                        that's an awful lot of what sounds like very dull work just to keep
                        afloat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: It was a dull period for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, I suppose you couldn't envision ever
                        becoming an ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Well, I had never spent very much time thinking about becoming an

                <p>OLMSTED: I came back to the Department and I was assigned to the Bureau of East
                    Asian Affairs as an international economist, I guess they called me, in the
                    Office of Southwest Pacific Affairs. I was assigned specifically to working on
                    Indonesian and Malaysian Affairs.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. Well, that was the period when they divided the old Class 4.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. So it isn't slow, because you didn't slide back to
                        Class 5. [In 1956, changes were made in the classification of Foreign
                        Service officers. Additional classes were added and class four was divided
                        into class four and five. Olmsted was in the top half of four and so
                        retained that grade level.] Now things seem to be coming together here. You
                        moved on to New Delhi and you had been working that part of the world in
                        economics. Did you have a feeling things were coming together at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: When I was at the Fletcher School, I became very interested in the Third
                    World for the first time, so I was very pleased when I was assigned to work on
                    Indonesian Affairs. I worked very hard in that job.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: And I liked it very much. When they offered me New Delhi, I accepted
                    with alacrity, although I knew very little about India. I had to take a step
                    back. I'd just been promoted to Class 3, but the best they could offer me was a
                    Class 4 slot.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, I did. The embassy had quite a large economic section in New Delhi,
                    and the new person usually gets the dregs, and I did. But I caught on to the
                    fact that in a large and very complicated and very different economy like
                    India's, you can't start out at the top. You've got to learn. So I took
                    advantage of the situation and, again, I cleaned up some backlogs of work, but I
                    managed to keep moving so that I worked in one area of the economy and another
                    and another, and after a while I became the person others were turning to,
                    because I had the broadest view of things.Living in India is exasperating, it's
                    frustrating, it's depressing, but it's always fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So much poverty.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. Well, it's not the poverty that's fascinating, that's the
                    depressing part. But I did a great deal of traveling and saw a lot of India,
                    managed to get away from the New Delhi cocktail circuit fairly often. I enjoyed
                    it very much, a very, very enriching experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in New Delhi, then, for at least four years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Four and a half years.</p>
                <p>[July 3, 1985 interview begins]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Olmsted, we have talked about your being in
                        India four and a half years, but we haven't touched on the private side of
                        things. Where did you live when you were in India? Were there embassy staff
                        apartments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I was in embassy housing. It was an old, large house that had been built
                    originally for someone on the Viceroy's staff. It was in the Mogul fashion,
                    built around a courtyard and there were two little houses out from the main
                    house. They were for the two aides-de-camp of whoever was on the Viceroy
                    staff.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>At one time, the United States High Commissioner and, I believe, the ambassador
                    had lived there in the fairly early days, but then another house was chosen for
                    the ambassador's residence, and this was cut up into apartments. I had one of
                    the two little houses that extended out from the main building, and a very large
                    garden. I had my own household staff. I had a cook bearer and a sweeper and a
                    part-time laundryman and a part-time gardener.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find those yourself, those people? You hired them
                        yourself, or did you inherit them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I hired them myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What language did you use with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I used English mainly. My bearer spoke enough English so he could serve
                    as interpreter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other women officers there? I know you and
                        Carol Laise overlapped a little bit. But were there any others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, Carol Laise was there for the first several months that I was
                    there. Let me see. The commercial attach�, Virginia Torreson, came somewhat
                    later. There were some women officers in USIA. I'm not sure I can remember their
                    names now. The personnel officer was a woman, and it seems to me there may have
                    been one or two others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you weren't feeling totally on your own, I suppose.
                        Overseas at times, I would be very homesick. But of course, I had a family
                        around me and things to keep me busy. What does one do when one is by
                        oneself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I worked quite long hours in New Delhi, and there was sort of a built-in
                    social life, plus the fact I did a lot of travel, as I mentioned before. In
                    addition to that, I've always liked gardening, and I worked in my garden,
                    supervising the maliwallah and doing the things that he never bothered to do. I
                    had some friends in the local community and among the diplomatic corps, as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that more of your free time was spent with
                        non-embassy people, or with embassy people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Probably with embassy people.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of things did you do for recreation to keep
                        yourself fit? It's such a hot climate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Well, I'm not terribly interested in sports, and I did not engage very
                    much in sports, although I had a bicycle and I did some bicycling around. I like
                    to walk, and I did a fair amount of walking. I was interested in the local
                    culture. There was always sightseeing, always temples and old buildings of one
                    sort or another to look at.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it the custom, as it was with the British, to go up in
                        the hills when it got really hot?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Well, some people did, but the embassy usually saw fit to let the
                    married people go up with their families and the single people usually stayed in
                    New Delhi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, it seems to me you single people have a pretty
                        rough deal, really. It's true. You get the odd weekend duties and that sort
                        of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, that's true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think definitely you do. When you had finished your
                        assignment in New Delhi, did you feel you had grown a lot in your career
                        from your years there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, I did. I felt that was something of a crossroads for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that because of the fact that you were much more
                        knowledgeable about another culture, or because of the economic reporting
                        you did? Can you pinpoint it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I think I probably did more in the way of original reporting, more of
                    the analytic reporting there. In addition to that, for the first time I moved
                    into a semi-supervisory job. I became the deputy to the economic counselor, and
                    it was a fairly large economic section. I did a good deal of the liaison work
                    with AID, although that was a rather informal arrangement. Consequently, I had
                    more responsibility and I moved into areas I had not been in before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Is that why you were detached to the Senior Seminar,
                        do you think, because of the quality of your work there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I don't know. One never knows about these things.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems to me, from looking back and looking at friends
                        and so forth, that people who were picked for the Senior Seminar were people
                        who had been sort of selected. At that time, did you think you would become
                        an ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I very much doubt that I gave it any thought at all. (Chuckles)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because the men do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, the men do, but I don't think I ever gave very much thought to
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you just went into the Senior Seminar. What was your
                        reaction to that? Did you think it was worthwhile?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, I thought it was an extremely interesting course. I thought that I
                    needed it very much in re-acquainting myself with what was going on in the
                    United States. I felt that I had been quite cut off. I was quite absorbed in
                    what was going on in India, and although we did get the Paris edition of the
                    Herald Tribune, it was always several days late and it wasn't really as
                    meaningful as the Washington Post would have been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Exactly. Exactly. This was in 1965. So when you came back,
                        of course, you must have found yourself sort of tossed into this alien
                        culture, where everybody was marching for civil rights.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, it was. Shortly after the seminar opened, the riots and of Watts
                    took place, and I remember that as being a real shocker to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go for your trip [for the Senior
                        Seminar]?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I made an round-the-world trip, and I went back to the subcontinent. I
                    wrote a paper on Nepal, which was not as far away from India as I would have
                    liked to have gotten. What I wanted to do was write on outer space, but that was
                    vetoed by the coordinator of the Senior Seminar, who thought that space had
                    become too romantic and wasn't really a serious matter.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Quite relevant, I would have thought. You do select your
                        own? You think up your own topics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, you think it up, but it has to be approved, or at least that was
                    the system when I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Shortly after you returned, within a few months, you were
                        then promoted to an 02, which is now called [officer] counselor, which then
                        put you in the really senior category.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you were assigned as a supervisory economic officer,
                        is that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I was the senior economic officer for India, Nepal, and Ceylon. This was
                    the Bureau of Near Eastern and South Asian Affairs, and the country director
                    system had been established, or was established, I think, just after I went into
                    that job, whereas previously the responsibilities had been quite regional. That
                    is, South Asia was under one group. That group was broken up into two pieces and
                    one person became a country director for India, Nepal, Ceylon, and I was the
                    senior economic officer in that office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. By this time, you really were well locked into
                        economics, weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That you continued for three years. Could you describe
                        what your duties were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: The first year I was there, my duties were mainly connected with food
                    and PL 480 matters. [Public Law 480 provided that surpluses of U.S. agricultural
                    products could given as a form of foreign assistance.] The year that I was in
                    the Senior Seminar, India had undergone a serious drought and threat of famine.
                    The following year, the year that I went into this work, there was a second year
                    of drought and a second year of famine. My responsibilities should have been
                    fairly broad, but I had to focus very much on the question of getting PL 480
                    supplies, mainly grains, to India.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's mostly through the director general's office?</hi>

                <p>OLMSTED: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you were detached to the Office of Economic
                        Opportunity [OEO]. What was that position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I went into the planning and research area of the Office of Economic
                    Opportunity. It was a very considerable change of pace for me. My feelings about
                    it were somewhat mixed. In some ways I was glad to have the opportunity to come
                    a little closer to what was going on in the United States. I did feel a concern
                    for the poor and what could be done in the way of economic development in the
                    United States, just as I had been in countries abroad. I was glad to have the
                    experience of working with an entirely different group of people who came from
                    different backgrounds, different aspirations, different interests, different
                    everything, although they, too, were Americans.</p>
                <p>I thought there was a certain lack of practicality. I thought there was a certain
                    lack of knowing exactly how to approach the problems. I could see that the
                    intentions were very good, but in many instances I thought that what was being
                    done was not really accomplishing very much.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: Somewhat. I had looked for another assignment in the Department, and
                    there was nothing available that I found very interesting. Therefore, I thought,
                    “I'll do something different.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure. Sure. So you stayed there for more than a year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: It was more than a year. I don't remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: November '69 to about August '71, according to your record
                        in the Biographical Register.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No, it wasn't August '71; it was early '71 that I came back to the
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. And in that time you were promoted to FSO 1, which
                        is very good, because that's only five years. That's very good, isn't it,
                        from 2 to 1? So by that time you must have thought you really were going to
                        go places, didn't you? Or you still didn't think about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Well, I didn't think very much about it. I must say I had not really
                    expected that promotion from 2 to 1. I was pleased, but I was very
                    surprised.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that, do you think, because of the work you'd done in
                        India?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No, I don't, particularly. Of course, they review your whole record. It
                    is hard to get a good efficiency rating, an officer's performance rating, from
                    an outside agency. The Department habitually sends out an inspector to write a
                    rather long detailed inspector's report to supplement what the other agency may
                    have written. I had, during the time I was in OEO, become interested in the
                    women's movement in the Department of State, and had become very active in it,
                    even though I wasn't there. The inspector who was assigned to write my
                    performance rating was very much of a feminist, a woman inspector named Gladys
                    Rogers, who was very interested in what I was doing. I think that a very strong
                    report that she wrote on me had a lot to do with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The next job you had, you went back to the Department, and
                        you were in personnel management?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: First I went back to the Board of Examiners for the Foreign Service. I
                    was there over complement. That's probably why it doesn't show in my record. I
                    sat on one of the examining panels as an economic officer and I was particularly
                    interviewing economic officers who were applying for the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that about an eight-week or ten-week panel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: At the time I was there, I think they were running all year 'round,
                    because we were also interviewing people for transfer from staff to FSO
                    categories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you got the Christian Herter Award in 1972. What was
                        that for, ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: That was for my work with the women of the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell us a little bit more about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: When I was in OEO, I had a telephone call one weekend from someone whom
                    I had known very slightly, a woman by the name of Jean Joyce, who was in the
                    Bureau of Cultural and Educational Affairs. She said to me that a group of women
                    in the Department were becoming concerned over the fact that there was great
                    activity going on in the formulation of new policies under the Macomber Study,
                    “Diplomacy for the Seventies,” and women were concerned that they were being
                    left out, that no consideration was being given to the role that women might
                    play. She said that a group of them were getting together for brown-bag lunches
                    to talk about it. She asked me if I'd like to join them. I said, “Yes, I
                    would.”</p>
                <p>So I packed a brown-bag lunch and went over, and that was the beginning. There
                    was only a small handful of us, but as we continued and talked, we became larger
                    and began formulating what we were going to do. We decided we had to make a
                    package proposal to someone, probably Mr. Macomber, who was then the Deputy
                    Under Secretary for Management, about what we thought he should do and what we
                    thought the Department should do.</p>
                <p>We spent several weekends drawing together the facts and writing out our
                    proposals and recommendations and so on. Many of the meetings were held here in
                    this apartment. Over a period of time, I became the chairman of this group,
                    which was then called the Ad Hoc Committee to Improve the Status of Women in the
                    Foreign Affairs Agencies. That group increased in size and began developing new
                    ideas.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>We did call on Mr. Macomber. We did so on the 26th of August, which was Women's
                    Suffrage Day, of course, and presented him with a package of proposals, some of
                    which he accepted on the spot, and others he said he thought would require
                    further study. That encouraged us tremendously.</p>
                <p>One of the things we persuaded him to do was to hold an open meeting for women in
                    the Department of State and the other agencies, and it was a meeting that took
                    several hours. It was held in one of the big conference rooms. This proved very
                    successful in drawing out women who had previously stayed on the sidelines. Some
                    of the things that people stood up on the floor and said, things that were
                    debated, made the Department realize that they had got to get moving on the
                    things that women were talking about.</p>
                <p>The Department had been required by executive order—and I can't remember the
                    number of it now—to take certain steps regarding women employees. One of the
                    parts of that package was the establishment of a federal women's program with
                    some woman at the head of it. The Department had not bothered to do that until
                    we became active, and then suddenly it did appoint someone for that job. There
                    was some debate among us, did we need to continue now that there was a women's
                    coordinator? We decided, yes, we did need to continue, because a little pressure
                    from the outside always helps. So we formalized our status to become the Women's
                    Action Organization, State, AID, USIA, and I became the first president.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did you serve as president?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I think it was a little more than a year. I don't remember exactly. I
                    think I became president around the end of—my memory is slipping. Let's see. I
                    went to OEO in 1969, didn't I?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I was there in '70. I think it was around the beginning of '71 that I
                    became the first president. Then I was taken into the Office of Personnel,
                    first, as I mentioned before, on the Board of Examiners, and then I became
                    Deputy Director of Personnel for Policy Position, Classification—and I've
                    forgotten the other things. This was on the technical side, rather than on the
                    assignment side. After I went into that job, which turned out to be a very tough
                    job, I was having less and less time for the Women's Action Organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think it's because of your work on the Women's
                        Action Committee that you were placed in personnel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, I do.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you see all that action did have results.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, yes. Many women felt that they would hurt their careers by going
                    into an organization such as the Women's Action Organization. I found that was
                    not true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many women did you have in this? What proportion of
                        the women who worked for the State Department and AID and USIA did join the
                        group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I'm not sure I can answer that. We started out with a very small group,
                    which gradually grew. I think we got up to nearly 1,000, our largest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does that still go on today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. It's not very active now, but it does exist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What exactly is the Christian Herter Award for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: The Herter Award was for “extraordinary contributions to the practice of
                    diplomacy, exemplifying intellectual courage and a zeal for creative
                    accomplishment.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very good. Is that given annually?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, and $1,000 goes along with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's nice. Did you treat yourself to a good vacation?
                        (Laughter) You must have been very, very busy with all of that. Did you
                        enjoy personnel work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, it was quite interesting. It was a new field for me, but I found
                    there were many aspects of it that I thought were indeed well worth the
                    assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You certainly get to know who everybody is, don't
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Several people told me it's been very helpful to them to
                        get an overview, so to speak.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, yes. I went in with the group that was put into personnel shortly
                    after the suicide of Charles Thomas. It was a very tense period. There was a
                    great deal of pressure brought to bear on us. [Foreign Service Officer Charles
                    W. Thomas committed suicide allegedly because of despondency after being dropped
                    from the service. The Foreign Service term for involuntary retirement is
                    “selection-out.”]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was because of the selection-out process, wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. There were a lot of controversies. There were a lot of protests and
                    complaints from people all over the Department, and it was not an easy time for
                    any of us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But didn't you find that the '70s were a very difficult
                        time, just in general, for the whole country, with the Vietnam War?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, I think that's true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It affected people's spirits. Were you active in the
                        Vietnam protests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were active in the women's issues. Then you became
                        Deputy Director General of the Foreign Service, is that correct? Or
                        Acting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Acting Deputy Director General, yes. There was a gap in the assignment
                    of the director. One director general had left, and there was a gap in the
                    assignment before a new one came on board. During that time, I was pushed up to
                    becoming the Acting Deputy Director General.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's an awful lot of responsibility, I would think. Now
                        you went out to Port Moresby. That was in June of '74?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As principal officer. So in other words, you were made
                        Consul General. Sworn in and so forth.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, did you know that was going to become an
                        Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: It seemed quite likely. Papua New Guinea, in the beginning, was
                    obviously on the road to independence, and no one knew exactly when it would
                    take place. But it seemed likely it would be within a year or so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you given any promises that you would have the
                        slot?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No. I didn't ask for them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'm sure you didn't ask for it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Well, people do negotiate sometimes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I know, but I can't imagine you doing it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I knew enough about the way personnel matters operate. The person who
                    makes the commitments is usually someplace else by the time you want to call in
                    your commitment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd love to hear more about the post. How many people were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: I opened the post. The Department sent in an advance team consisting of
                    the young man who was to become our administrative officer and another young man
                    who was sent out from the Department. They looked around to try to locate both
                    housing and office space for us. Then my secretary went out a few days before I
                    did. When I arrived, we had a staff of two people, which was the administrative
                    officer and my secretary, and we moved into some rather shabby quarters over a
                    lunch counter and a bookstore. There was no furniture in our quarters. We had
                    ordered office furniture from Australia, but obviously it wouldn't get there for
                    a couple of months. So we borrowed three battered desks and five chairs from the
                    people we were renting the space from. These were straight chairs, not swivel
                    chairs. As I say, these offices were a bit grubby. They were carpeted with large
                    squares of blue and bluish-green cheap carpeting, and curtains were orange and
                    white. The offices were broken down into little rabbit warrens. There were just
                    a whole passel of these little rabbit warrens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Typical embassy. (Laughter)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. The floors creaked when we walked across them. We took out one of
                    the walls to make a slightly larger office for me. We did little shopping
                    locally. Things were expensive, and there wasn't very much variety. One day when
                    we had three visitors and all of our staff of three were there, one person had
                    to stand because we only had five chairs. So I told the administrative officer,
                    “For goodness sakes, go out and buy a few chairs locally and we can use them
                    somehow,” and we did. We also bought a large heavy table to put out Telex on,
                    got the Telex installed, and that linked us up first with Australia and then
                    later with Washington. We felt a little bit more in touch with things.</p>
                <p>Then one day our shipment from Tokyo arrived. When a new post is opened, they
                    always ask one of the large embassies in the area to make up a shipment of
                    things that a new post will need and send them down. Well, obviously Tokyo
                    cleaned out its attic when it made its shipment for us. This great big lift van
                    arrived and was opened up, and the things were put in boxes in the reception
                    room. We opened them one by one, and the stationery, envelopes, and consular
                    forms, and seals and rubber stamps and all kinds of things that we needed, and
                    there were paper clips. We couldn't get any paper clips locally. Running an
                    office without paper clips is a bit of a challenge. They also sent our flags.
                    They sent one flag that was nineteen feet long, and we had to open it up through
                    the doors of three offices to see what size it was. I'm sure it was the largest
                    flag in all of Papua New Guinea. We found exactly one use for it all the time
                    that I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that for the Fourth of July?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. Yes, we strung it up on the Bicentennial Fourth of July.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>So we were busy sorting those things out and making acquaintances around town. I
                    knew it was important for me to get out and make calls, which I did, and become
                    acquainted and let people know that the Americans were here and in business. It
                    was quite clear we could not start operating our consular office for some time,
                    because we just weren't set up for it. When people came in to ask for consular
                    services, we just had to tell them, “Come back maybe in October and we'll be
                    able to help you then.”</p>
                <p>So little by little, we did get established. Our shipment of office furniture
                    arrived from Australia after a few months, and we had swivel chairs and real
                    desks and desk lamps and all sorts of things that made us feel that we were
                    coming up in the world. So you can see there are a series of steps that we took,
                    one by one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. You got the entire experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, and it wasn't until the end of the year that we really felt that we
                    were fully operational. By that time, I think we were. Other personnel arrived.
                    The political officer came, to be followed a few months later by the economic
                    officer, who was also to do the consular work, and then the second of our two
                    secretaries arrived. That was the group that manned the ship until after
                    independence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time it was Papua New Guinea, and not the Solomon
                        Islands, is that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I was assigned to Papua New Guinea. The Solomon Islands is a different
                    political entity. It was under the British. I was told I would be responsible
                    for handling whatever came up in connection with the Solomon Islands, and I
                    should go over there from time to time, and which I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it very far away?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: The small plane that connects them is nearly a four-hour flight. That
                    is, from Port Moresby.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you live?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I lived in Port Moresby, on the side of a hill overlooking the Coral
                    Sea, an absolutely spectacular view of the curving coastline and the little
                    islands dotting the harbor. From my patio I could look 180 degrees around the
                    horizon. Below me at the left, there was a fishing village on stilts built out
                    over the water. To my right there was the curve of Paga Hill.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>I was in a very modernistic house which was built by a Greek Cypriot who,
                    according to the story, had arrived at Papua New Guinea practically penniless
                    and was a soda-jerk at one of the downtown department stores initially. Being an
                    educated man and, I think, quite clever and quite determined, he eventually got
                    into more lucrative work and did quite well for himself financially. He built
                    this as a bachelor's pad. You could see that a bachelor had built it, from many
                    of its shortcomings. But it was an interesting house. The ceiling was seventeen
                    feet high in the living room on one side sloping down to about four feet on the
                    other side. There were five walls to the living room, three of which were glass,
                    which gave a magnificent view of the Coral Sea and the coastline.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who kept the house for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I hired a house boy named Kisini, who stayed with me all the time I was
                    there. He had only a little training. I talked to some Australians about
                    servants. Lady Cleveland was one who warned me that you can do worse with having
                    someone who is trained in a way you don't like than in hiring someone with
                    limited training whom you can train the way you do like. So I took the latter
                    choice. This young man, I'm sure, was still in his teens when he first came to
                    me, and spoke very little English. I had an Australian friend who had been a
                    rubber plantation owner in Papua New Guinea for many, many years before he
                    retired, and he had had a plantation in the area where my house boy came from,
                    and he spoke the language. When I ran into real problems, I'd telephone him and
                    he would play interpreter over the telephone for whatever it was that I wanted
                    to get across. (Laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he cook for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. It was rather simple cooking, but I showed him some additional
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you buy everything on the local market, or did you
                        import?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: We bought everything on the local market. There were a couple of
                    Australian supermarkets there. In Port Moresby, they have supermarkets as
                    adjuncts to department stores. There are two of those which had really a
                    surprising variety of things. I could buy Sara Lee frozen goods made in
                    Australia there, and quite a variety. Then I'd go to the local market for the
                    local fresh produce.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you didn't import shipments of food for yourself from
                        any other place?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: No. We could have, but it always seemed like more trouble than it was
                    worth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you get things like ham?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. I think it was mainly canned ham that we got, but there was local
                    beef available, and there was a German delicatessen which had some quite nice
                    things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the host country react to having a woman consul
                        general and then ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Papua New Guineans are very conservative people. They don't jump to
                    conclusions. They don't go off on rash tangents. They sit down and think things
                    over very carefully. I'm using “conservative” not in the political sense, but in
                    the real meaning of the word. So when I arrived, they were a little taken aback,
                    but they thought it over very carefully and wanted to see what kind of a person
                    I was and how I fitted in. Then after I had been there for some time, Washington
                    appointed Ann Armstrong as ambassador to London. When the Papua New Guineans
                    learned that London had an American ambassador who was a woman and they did,
                    too, they rather felt that put them in the class with London.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't that charming.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: That was pretty nice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, that's charming.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Tell me what happens when there is independence and then our government decides
                    it's going to be an embassy, not a ministry or whatever. How do they technically
                    do that? How do you get sworn in, for example?</p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Let me answer your first question first. I don't believe there's a
                    single legation now. It's almost automatic that if a country becomes
                    independent, the mission that we will have there will be an embassy. There is no
                    question about that, as far as I am aware.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>On the day of independence, we had a little ceremony elevating the Consulate
                    General to the status of embassy, and we unveiled our plaque which read “Embassy
                    of the United States” in place of the one that said “Consulate General of the
                    United States.” I automatically became the charg� d'affaires. I had hoped, of
                    course, that I would become the ambassador, and I had decided I would not stay
                    on as DCM if they appointed somebody else. I didn't know what was going on back
                    in Washington. Our communications weren't all that good; nobody had visited
                    recently to bring us up to date on things back there.</p>
                <p>So I just sat back and waited to see what would happen. I knew I would be very
                    disappointed, because I liked Papua New Guinea and I wanted to stay on. I felt I
                    could handle the job, but I also know that there's many a slip when it comes to
                    ambassadorial appointments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was this, exactly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Well, independence was the sixteenth of September 1975, and that's when
                    the post became an embassy. Then I think it was sometime in late October that I
                    got the cable saying that President [Gerald] Ford wanted to appoint me as
                    ambassador, and was this agreeable with me. (Laughter) I sent back a very quick
                    cable saying, “Yes, I'd be delighted.” Then my name was eventually sent up to
                    the Senate, and I was confirmed in absentia. I did not go back for hearings.</p>
                <p>We had a little ceremony in my office, at which I was sworn in. I just had my
                    office staff and I invited a couple of people from the foreign office for it. We
                    drank champagne afterwards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who did the swearing in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: My consular officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you use a Bible?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, a family Bible. The second officer in the embassy, my political
                    officer, Mark Easton, presided over the ceremony, and the actual oath was
                    administered by the consular officer, and the Bible was held by the third
                    officer. So people got very much involved in it. As I say, we broke out the
                    champagne.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Did that automatically move your political officer to
                        become deputy chief of mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was he called? Political officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, and when I was away, he became the charg�.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did the Solomon Islands become included in your
                        mandate? At that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No. It was included rather informally in my mandate initially. As far as
                    I can recall, there were no papers exchanged or anything like that. We just let
                    them know quite informally that I would be looking after matters affecting the
                    United States in the Solomon Islands from my office in Port Moresby, and I would
                    visit there from time to time.</p>
                <p>The Solomon Islands was not then independent. I think there may have been some
                    notice given in London to the British, but I must say my memory is a little
                    faint about that now. The Solomon Islands did not become independent until 1978.
                    It was that time when I was named ambassador and presented my credentials and so
                    on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And had to be sworn in again?That, again, was under
                        President Ford?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No, that was under President [Jimmy] Carter in 1978.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, of course. [break in tape]Who was the head of state of
                        Papua New Guinea after independence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: The head of state was the governor general, who was Sir John Guise. He
                    was a political figure whose career had started as a policeman, and he had
                    eventually gotten into politics and filled various positions. He had been a
                    colleague of the prime minister, but there had been some falling out between
                    them, and I think he was more or less kicked upstairs to become the first
                    governor general. He was a man with considerable political ambitions, but I
                    don't think he realized that he would have no powers. It was a purely ceremonial
                    office, I think he was quite disappointed, and he resigned before his term was
                    out.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: About a hundred people. There are about a hundred members of
                    Parliament.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No, not yet. It's a very primitive country, very, very undeveloped, and
                    it will be a long time before these things can be arranged. When they conduct a
                    national election, it takes three weeks because they don't have enough trained
                    people to hold it simultaneously in all parts of the country. Therefore, they
                    will send teams out to these very remote areas and election officials will go by
                    small plane, even helicopter, and by canoe, and on foot to reach these remote
                    places. Everyone is given a chance to vote, and then the ballots are kept sealed
                    until the election in completed. Then they're counted.</p>
                <p>I was there for one election, and it was my definite opinion that although there
                    were a few irregularities, they were dealt with either administratively or in
                    the courts. I thought that it was a remarkably honest and fair election.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Well, I think that it is probably someplace around 20%, but it's awfully
                    hard to know. You've also got to make certain assumptions as to what kind of
                    literacy is it. Is it literacy in English you're talking about? There may be
                    some people who are literate in their own language, which is spoken by only a
                    very few people. There are 750 different languages spoken in Papua New Guinea.

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: It's very largely spoken. There has been a semi-missionary group, the
                    Summer Institute of Linguistics, which has done a great deal of work in the
                    languages of Papua New Guinea, and they will send a team into a village, where
                    the language has never been written down—[Begin Tape 2, Side 1]</p>
                <p>OLMSTED: . . . These linguists will learn the language, the grammar and the
                    vocabulary and eventually write articles in that language. Eventually their
                    intention was to translate the Bible into that language.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: It's the whispering vote, as they say. (Laughter) They whisper to the
                    person who is marking the ballot, whoever it is they want to vote for.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. Clan plays a very important role in this. It's the connections of
                    the people to the person who has been nominated. If they're from the same
                    language group or, even stronger, from the same clan, why, they're likely to
                    vote for that person. But the vote can get divided by two people from the same
                    language group or the same clan.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: Oh, goodness. I couldn't answer that. It's a very hard country to

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: There's a great deal of variation throughout the country, difference in
                    customs, in practices, difference in language, difference in standards, and so
                    on. I traveled in the villages a fair amount, and it seems to me that every
                    village has its own personality. You can sense that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is their feeling about the United States? Do they
                        look on us in a friendly way, or as an overwhelming giant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: The largest missionary presence in Papua New Guinea is the American
                    missionary presence, and there are many people who have studied at American
                    mission schools and who had Americans as their teachers. By and large, I would
                    say that the missions made a good impression, the mission teachers and also the
                    mission clinics and hospitals. There are, I'm sure, many people who think they
                    would not be alive, or at least would not be healthy, except that there was an
                    American mission hospital or clinic in their village, and they could go to it
                    and get a cure for their ailment. They may also remember that their favorite
                    teacher was an American teacher. I go into a store and buy something, talk a
                    little bit to the clerk, and the clerk would ask me was I an American. I'd say,
                    “Yes, how did you know?” He would say, “Well, you talk just like my teacher, who
                    is an American.”</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>Consequently, I think that Americans are well regarded. I also think that the
                    older people who remember the Second World War regard Americans highly. The
                    Japanese were, in many areas, quite cruel in their treatment of the local
                    people, and there was quite a contrast between the way the Japanese treated them
                    in most places, not in every place, and the way the Americans treated them. When
                    the American troops came in, they brought with them just vast quantities of
                    materiel and things like refrigerators and candy bars and everything in between.
                    They had jeeps, they had airplanes, and so on, much more than the Australians
                    ever brought in. It was the first time that the Papua New Guineans realized that
                    there was a country that was more powerful and richer than Australia, and that
                    impressed them.</p>
                <p>Another thing that impressed them was the fact that there were black American
                    troops and there were black officers. John Guise, whose name I mentioned a
                    little bit ago, will say—I've heard him say it—that he remembers when he saw
                    American blacks giving orders to American whites in the military, and they were
                    obeyed. He said he saw them doing what looked like, to him, highly skilled work,
                    technical work of one sort or another. This was one of the factors in starting
                    the stirrings of independence, because the people started looking at each other
                    and said, “That man's black and look what he's doing. Why can't I do it,
                    too?”</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, we do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it any one particular religion that had missions out
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: The two largest were the Catholics and the Lutherans. And in addition to
                    them, there was everything you have ever heard of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the missionaries fight for territory the way they did
                        in Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: At one time there was a division established, and even today you can
                    almost tell what a person's religion is, if he's a Christian, by the area he
                    comes from. The Catholics had the Sepik area. I've forgotten exactly how far it
                    ran. Then the Anglicans had the northern province. I can't remember what the
                    others were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they did divide it up into territories?</hi>

                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, they did. Therefore, I think there was probably less of the
                    friction that there may have been from other countries. Plus the fact Papua New
                    Guinea covers a fairly wide area, and with three million people, the population
                    is quite spread out.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, they're all Melanesians. Papua New Guinea did not receive very much
                    in the way of economic development or education from the Australians until the
                    early or middle '60s. But I guess it was the early '60s, the Australians were
                    beginning to realize they were going to have to do something with Papua New
                    Guinea. Either they were going to have to incorporate it into Australia as Papua
                    New Guinea or they'd have to let it go. About that time, a British-led UN team
                    wrote a very caustic report on the Australian administration of Papua New
                    Guinea. These two things came together to spur the Australians into action, and
                    they started pouring more money into Papua New Guinea. They put new emphasis on
                    education. They built primary schools and high schools in many places that had
                    never had schools before. They established a University of Papua New Guinea and
                    a University of Technology, as well, and they stimulated work in the Teachers
                    Colleges and so on. But you can't educate a nation in the matter of a few years.
                    Consequently, at the time of independence, the number of educated, trained,
                    experienced people was very, very small and has been a great handicap to
                    them.</p>
                <p>In the Solomon Islands, many of the government leaders were educated in New
                    Zealand with scholarships from the New Zealand government. I thought that the
                    general level of education among the Solomon Islanders in the government was
                    somewhat higher than in Papua New Guinea, although I have never seen a
                    comparative study.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Papua New Guineans who were trained had gotten their
                        education in Australia or from the missionaries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Most of them as children went to missionary schools, and then some of
                    them had the chance to go to Australia for their secondary training. The older
                    ones, a few of them, got university training, but not very many. Then about the
                    time larger numbers were coming into the university level in the late 1960's,
                    the University of Papua New Guinea was opened and they started going there.</p>
                <p>Of the older group, the prime minister, the minister of foreign affairs, and so
                    on, most of them went to what was a high school at Sogeri. Most of them knew
                    each other because they were the cream of the crop, and the high school at
                    Sogeri was the highest education available to them.</p>

                    to Papua New Guinea, and there's plenty of water. In most parts of the country,

                    ratio of population to land area is very favorable, and therefore there isn't
                    the kind of rural slums that you find in other places. [Tape recorder turned

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I often began the day with a quick swim in my little pool, and then had
                    breakfast. One of the things I always missed at breakfast was not being able to
                    read a newspaper, which I had done all my life. But they don't deliver
                    newspapers in Papua New Guinea. You have to go down to the store and buy them.
                    The arrangement was that my driver, after he took me to the office, would pick
                    up the paper, so I would have it in my office maybe five minutes after I got

                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>But after breakfast, my driver came and took me to the office. The security
                    people used to tell us we should use a different route going to the office every
                    day but that was quite impossible. There was one way to get there, unless one
                    went perhaps twenty miles out of the way to take the ring road all the way
                    around Port Moresby. So we followed the same route, driving along the coastline
                    of the Coral Sea, looking out at that magnificent view. I never got tired of
                    looking at it. Then swinging up Paga Pava Hill and to the office.</p>
                <p>Once in the office, I would look at the cables, and read the newspaper when it
                    was delivered to me. Then the day would begin. There would be things to discuss
                    with various staff members, perhaps a staff meeting or perhaps just individual
                    discussions. There would be people outside the office to see, perhaps someone to
                    call on in the government, or perhaps a discussion with a colleague from the
                    diplomatic corps. Often I had lunch in town with someone, but I also stayed
                    home, occasionally having luncheons, as was appropriate for the occasion.</p>
                <p>We had a surprising number of visitors from the United States in Port Moresby. I
                    sometimes thought that among the well-traveled people of the American
                    Government, there are many who thought they'd been almost everywhere except
                    Papua New Guinea, and therefore they had to stop to see Papua New Guinea as they
                    were making their swing through Eastern Asia. So I might have a visitor to talk
                    to or to take on a call or something like that.</p>
                <p>Then I would perhaps have a cable or two to write, and the work of my office
                    staff to review and sign, and then the day would end. We did not often work
                    overtime in Port Moresby, and the office closed at 4:30. We opened at 8:00 and
                    closed at 4:30, because athletics and sports were very important in the lives of
                    people in Port Moresby, and my staff, of course, wanted to be included in that.
                    Many of my staff played golf. Some of them were boaters. One very enterprising
                    young officer built his own sailboat, did a beautiful job on it. Another bought
                    a small boat, and others had other pastimes that they enjoyed. Squash was
                    popular with some members of the staff.</p>
                <p>So after work, I would go home and usually check around about household matters
                    and oversee what the house boy had done or had failed to do and what the
                    gardener had done or neglected. Then often there would be a cocktail party or
                    dinner, and perhaps both.</p>
                <p>There was a rather lively small social life in Port Moresby. People did quite a
                    bit of entertaining because there really wasn't a great deal of other things to
                    do. There were a couple of theatrical groups which did put on plays from time to
                    time, and I always went to those. Occasionally there would be performances that
                    the government would put on of one sort or another. The National Arts School
                    regularly had showings of their students' work, along with a little reception. I
                    regularly went to those. However, the kind of cultural attractions that one
                    finds in a city like Washington are, of course, quite missing in Port
                    Moresby.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>The cocktail parties were sometimes held in the big hotels—they would not be big
                    by American standards—and sometimes in people's houses. So fairly frequently I
                    would go to one of those, and I myself entertained. I had a beautiful view of
                    the Coral Sea from my patio, and I found that small cocktail parties at sunset
                    were an effective way to entertain. It was a good way to entertain visitors, for
                    example, a small enough party so they'd have a chance to talk to people and
                    could enjoy watching the setting sun over the Coral Sea, which is a lovely,
                    lovely sight, and then watch the lights come on around the coastline as the sun
                    went down. Of course, sunset came very quickly and darkness followed promptly as
                    we were close to the equator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very dramatic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Very dramatic. Some of the dinners that were given, again, were in
                    hotels. When the government entertained, it usually entertained in a hotel.
                    There were a lot of official visitors for the government around the time of
                    independence, and they did indeed entertain them and invite the diplomatic
                    corps.</p>
                <p>The diplomatic corps itself usually entertained in their own homes, as did the
                    expatriate community, which was largely Australian. There were a number of
                    Australian businessmen there, banks, insurance people, and so on. They formed
                    part of the group. I found that I circulated in several different groups. First
                    the official group, the government and diplomatic corps. Another, which was
                    related to, but a little apart from it, was the business community, which I,
                    frankly, did not enjoy as much as some of the other groups. The business
                    community tended to be people who were not terribly well educated, not very
                    broad in their outlook; interested in making money and going home. I found them
                    a less appealing group. Another group was the university, and I did make a real
                    effort to cultivate contacts in the university, and I enjoyed people there. I
                    saw quite a bit of them socially and otherwise.</p>
                <p>The faculty of the university was like the UN, there were so many different
                    nationalities there. It had originally been Australian, but a ceiling was
                    imposed on the salaries of the faculty at the University of Papua New Guinea
                    when the salaries were still rising in Australia. That meant the Australians,
                    one by one, went back home, and they were replaced by New Zealanders, by
                    Americans, by British, by Indians, Pakistanis, Africans, and so on. There is
                    quite a lively group out there, and I did enjoy them. And another group that I
                    circulated in, which was close to, but not quite the same, was the arts and
                    crafts group, the people who were interested in the arts and in the artifacts
                    and in buying and learning about the New Guinean artwork, particularly from the
                    Sepik, but also some of the other carvings and weavings and things like
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wood carvings?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, largely. A few of other things, but largely wood carvings, bone and
                    a few other things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do they do any work in bronze?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No metals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Copper beating is not traditional, but it is done there. It has been
                    introduced by the Westerners, and that top piece there is a Papua New Guinea
                    copper beating. I have some others. The National Art School was trying to teach
                    the students to use their traditional motifs, but in modern or different media,
                    and one of them was copper beating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do they do the feather weaving?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No. That is Polynesian. They traditionally have done some tapa work, but
                    that is dying out. Wood carving is surely the most important of their styles of
                    art, and some of the pieces are quite large: poles, for example, and very large
                    masks, what they call the orator's stool, which is a large mask, sometimes six
                    feet tall or even taller. It's built on the side of a small stool which is not
                    intended to be sat upon. In the men's houses, (where all the men of the village
                    live) when a speaker is making an address to his colleagues and friends and
                    neighbors, he will stand beside his orator's stool with a little batch of vines
                    in his hand, or reeds, or something like that. When he makes a point, he will
                    strike this little seat there to emphasize what he is saying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fascinating! The picture there with the men with their
                        head pieces. What did you call those?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Those are called the wig men of the Southern Highlands. They cut off
                    their hair and then weave it into a sort of a hat and decorate it and dye it and
                    so on. I have a picture of one man who has decorated his wig with what is
                    obviously a label from a can of salmon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Charming. Do they still do this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this a token of their virility or that they're
                        chiefs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No, not that they're chiefs. They all do it. I went to a ceremony at
                    which a school was named after an American missionary who wrote me and invited
                    me to come up for the ceremony. This was in the Southern Highlands, and it was
                    at a point where two tribes came together. The land was divided, one tribe on
                    one side, one tribe on another. They had a great big sing-sing with
                    representatives, vast numbers of people from both of the tribes, which dress
                    somewhat differently, and that gave a particularly colorful appearance to the
                    scene.</p>
                <p>The ceremony started out with speeches and gift-giving. This was during the
                    elections and the politicians came to take advantage of the opportunity to make
                    political speeches. Then the organizers presented me with two stone axes and two
                    grass skirts and a live chicken.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And a live chicken!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I gave the chicken to the missionary quite hastily and I never saw it
                    again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the chicken represent anything particular, or were
                        they just being kind to give you a chicken?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Well, it was an appropriate gift from their point of view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are the lives of the women like in Papua New Guinea?
                        Of course, they would be quite different in the highlands than they would in
                        the city, I suppose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: You have to make several distinctions. There is one part of Papua New
                    Guinea which is referred to by anthropologists as the Massim, which includes
                    most, but not all, of the groups of people along the coast and in the islands
                    off to the east of Papua New Guinea, along the east and northern coast and
                    extends into Irian Jaya. Generally speaking, among these people there is a
                    matrilineal society. The inheritance goes through the mother, and the father
                    plays a relatively small role in his family. The mother's brother will bring up
                    the children, and he will be the important man in the family. He will pass the
                    secrets of sorcery down to his nephews, not to his sons. In those areas, the
                    woman has a considerably more important position than in the others. Customs
                    vary considerably throughout even the Massim, but a woman may have the right to
                    decide who gets which piece of land, clan-owned land, and this gives her really
                    quite a strong position. The women from those areas have a higher position and
                    are moving into government jobs and so on in a way that the women from the rest
                    of the country find very difficult to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>The other women, the highlanders and those from many other parts of the country,
                    are very much pushed back. There's no question about that. When I went to the
                    Southern Highlands, it was announced on the radio that a big important visitor,
                    a foreign visitor, was coming from Port Moresby to be present at this ceremony.
                    They told me that the announcer had a very hard time saying that a woman was
                    important. It was very difficult for him to bring himself to do that. Finally,
                    he managed it. (Laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It flew in the face of all his traditions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Absolutely. And the practice of having several wives prevails in the
                    highlands. The men generally live in men's houses, as a group apart from the
                    women, and visit their wives from time to time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do the women live together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No, they live in separate houses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Each mother with her children?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, and the pigs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The pigs are in the house?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are the pigs there for foodstuffs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. They're very important in the traditional economy, and they're a
                    sign of wealth. The more pigs a person has, by all means the more important he
                    is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it considered somewhat of a disgrace to have a baby
                        daughter, to give birth to a girl?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I don't think so, no. You see, they still have a system of bride price,
                    which means that the family of the prospective husband has to pay the family of
                    the bride in order to get her, and that means that a daughter is a source of
                    wealth.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course. What do they pay, usually?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: There are traditional forms of payment. It might be pigs and
                    cassowaries. It might be shells and shell money and things like that, but in
                    addition, as the modern world moves upon them, you will sometimes see, in a
                    procession, a long pole to which paper money has been tied, and that is part of
                    the bride price.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is divorce current?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No. Strange, I can't even remember hearing about divorce. I think a
                    husband would probably take another wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And just ignore the first one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Just ignore the first one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does he have to provide housing for each one of these
                        families he sets up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I'm sure there is some variation in the country on that. Ordinarily I
                    think they would all live in the same house, but in some places they may be

                    and smoking and enjoying themselves. It's the women who go out and plant and
                    cultivate and harvest.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, except in rather remote places you will see the children wearing
                    shorts and little shirts and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are they purchased or made?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Largely made. I visited the Western province, a really quite remote
                    place, a town called Kiunga, and visited a shop that had been set up under the
                    guidance of some very enlightened missionaries there. First they taught the
                    women to cook food in bulk so they could sell hot meals to the men who were
                    working on the roads, most of whom had come from the highlands and were there
                    without their wives. After they made a little money from that, they bought some
                    sewing machines and the missionaries taught the women how to make clothes. First
                    they clothed their own families, and then they started selling the clothes. They
                    sold the clothes again to the highland workers on the roads, who would take them
                    back to their families when they went home. They built up a nice little business
                    like that. This is where the status of women can be tremendously improved when
                    they become breadwinners and they do things for the family, bringing in money
                    and recognition.</p>
                <p>Shortly before I went there, the missionaries told me with a good deal of pride,
                    that now the men were coming to them and asking would the missionaries teach
                    them how to run a trade store, because they had seen the women making money, and
                    they thought, well, the next step was that they would do the selling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find among the women that they desired upward
                        mobility for their children, the mothers for their daughters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Not in all cases. Life in the village still had its attractions, and
                    there was a certain amount of burnout among the young people who went to
                    university, then got a job in the government and were under stress and pressure.
                    Some of them would go home again and want to have a quieter life. I think this
                    had some effect on the way that people viewed moving into the modern life. They
                    wanted some of the things that modern life could bring them; not all of
                    them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many wives did the typical man have? Was it prescribed

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No. Oh, no. Probably three or four, yes. But in Port Moresby, they
                    rarely had more than one wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because they couldn't afford it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. Members of Parliaments could leave their families at home and they
                    might have two or three wives. Of course, as they became Christian, the
                    Christian Church frowned on this, and sometimes there would be one wife who was
                    the church wife and the others were married by local custom and were outside the
                    church.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: I don't really know.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: No. I think they probably got along fairly well together, but I don't
                    really know.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fascinating. Was life very much different for them in the
                        city, in Port Moresby?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. Housing accommodations were really quite tight in Port Moresby and
                    there were the squatter settlements. If someone came into town without a job, he
                    would probably live with one of his relatives or, to use the pidgin word, wan
                    tok. It means “one talk,” one speech. It means a person speaking the same
                    language. And with 750 languages, you could see that this is important. The
                    person coming in from the highlands or elsewhere wanting the bright lights of
                    the city would probably move in with the wan toks and would scrounge around
                    trying to get whatever work he could. But ordinarily he wouldn't speak English.
                    He wouldn't have the skills that are needed, and this would be quite difficult
                    for him unless he were particularly fortunate. Consequently, all too many of
                    them turned to theft and burglary, and so there's a real crime problem in Port
                    Moresby, which I understand has become considerably worse since I left.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was just—</hi>
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, and snatching purses and breaking into houses. I might add, many of
                    the houses there, particularly the older ones built by Australians, were really
                    quite flimsy. They were built of fiberboard, and many of them had the louvered
                    windows. This combination provides very little security.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Thatched houses and dirt floors. In many parts of the country, the
                    houses are built on stilts, but that's not generally the practice in the
                    highlands.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, there are several. It's built more like some fairly modern cities,
                    small cities in the United States, with shopping sections scattered around and
                    houses around the shopping sections.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I put them up for quite a while, and then when the hotel situation
                    improved, depending on who it was perhaps they stayed in hotels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there American hotels there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No, they're all Australian. If not Australian-run, there's probably some
                    Australian money in most of the hotels there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Australians, of course, are still a very large
                        presence there, but America is coming in more and more, economically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Well, at the time I was there, there was interest on the part of
                    Americans, and I might add it was the big firms. It's too far away for a small
                    firm to get interested in. Just for selling things, the American firms usually
                    depended on their Australian subsidiaries to handle the sales. But big firms
                    like Weyerhaeuser and Kennecott would come through from time to time, look the
                    situation over, and perhaps make some moves in the direction of an investment,
                    but then pull back. Bechtel built the copper mine in Bougainville and also has
                    the contract for building the new one in the Western Province.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm surprised there hasn't been a Marriott Hotel. It
                        sounds such a beautiful country. I thought it could be developed for
                        tourism.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: Well, there is some tourism, but the government, as of the time I was
                    there, had not really made up its mind that it wanted a lot of tourism. It had
                    very mixed feelings about it. Fiji, as you may know, has gone in a big way into
                    tourism, and the Papua New Guineans were not entirely sure they liked the
                    result. They felt that there were a few jobs created, but not many. A lot of
                    money was being skimmed off and taken out of the country, and a lot of things
                    that they didn't particularly like were being brought in. They did not want to
                    have the drug culture brought in, and they were concerned over the flaunting of
                    wealth and so on that might make the people dissatisfied.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They sound like a very sensible people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, they are. One of the things they were trying to do, which I thought
                    made a lot of sense, was very small-scale specialized tourism like orchid
                    safaris and butterfly safaris and white water rafting and things like that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: And also it's not the class that demands the best of accommodations,
                    because they're willing to put up with the hardships and in fact rather enjoy
                    it.</p>
                <p>Lindblad made an arrangement with a little resort up on the north coast that they
                    would bring a certain number of tours, but they did it specifying that no
                    improvements would be made in the resort, no changes. For bathing, you would go
                    out to a cloth-enclosed area and take your shower from a bucket that has some
                    holes punched in it hung on a pole. That's the sort of thing that they wanted
                    left intact.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, copper, and there is gold and probably other minerals. They spent
                    quite a bit of money looking for oil, and they found some natural gas, but they
                    haven't found, as far as I'm aware, anything in the way of petroleum. They have
                    very rich forestry resources, which they are a little reluctant to develop too
                    fast because of the fear of deforestation.</p>

                <p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No, not as far as I'm aware. Not as the time I left. They have fishery
                    resources which will probably become quite important, and they have agricultural
                    resources. In the highlands there are broad, fertile valleys with rich volcanic
                    soil and lots of rain, lots of sunshine, and they can grow just about anything
                    that doesn't require cold weather. They can get two and three crops a year. They
                    are developing coffee and have quite significant coffee areas now. They found
                    coffee was much more appropriate than tea, because coffee doesn't require the
                    same careful care that tea does. The non-disciplined worker who won't show up
                    can ruin a tea plantation by neglect, whereas with coffee, they can pick the
                    coffee berries when they get around to it and go off for tribal fighting the
                    other times.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do they have canneries for the fish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Not as of the time I was there. They were negotiating with Star Kist,
                    the tuna company, for a long time, but had not reached an agreement as of the

                <p>They also have copra as a traditional crop, and the coconut plantations are
                    really very lovely. They are very, very pretty. But they are being replaced by
                    palm oil and things like that, which are much more profitable. Those are growing
                    very well on some of the islands and some of the coastal areas, and they have
                    cocoa, as well.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: In some places it gets pretty hot, but the trade winds generally have
                    cooling currents.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It really sounds like a paradise. Is it considered a

                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, I believe it's now classified as a hardship post.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: When I arrived there, the Australians, of course, were the administering
                    power. In addition to them, the British and the Indonesians had already
                    established their first offices. So the United States was the third to open
                    there. We were closely followed by the New Zealanders, who came in almost
                    immediately after. Let me see. Who was next? Now my memory's a little hazy. The
                    French then later opened up an embassy. Oh, yes, the Japanese came in then after
                    that, and then I think the French were next. It seems to me we had a diplomatic
                    corps of six or seven, which then expanded after I left.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Quite rapidly, I suppose.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Fairly rapidly. The Papua New Guineans were not terribly enthusiastic
                    about having a lot of foreign nations. They didn't see the need for them, and
                    they weren't intending to open up a lot of posts themselves. They thought that
                    their business could be handled in other ways with third countries, where both
                    of them were represented and so on.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I was on much friendlier terms with the second British High Commissioner
                    than I was with the first. With the New Zealanders, I was on much better terms
                    with the second than the first, again. So you know, it changed from time to
                    time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: We were really a close-knit little group and we did have our little

                    relations.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering if you were consulted about business
                        problems.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I had American business people coming through and wanting to talk to
                    me,[Begin Tape 2, Side 4]</p>
                <p>OLMSTED: . . . to the representatives of the multinational corporations. I had
                    representatives of American banks also call on me. This began a little bit
                    before independence, when representatives of the big New York banks who were in
                    the area decided they would test the waters in Papua New Guinea and they would
                    visit first with the local banking establishment and then come around and see
                    me.</p>
                <p>Six months later, I would see the same people or representatives of the same
                    banks again, and they were testing the water again. And six months later, they
                    would come for their next visit. They became a little more interested with each
                    visit, and finally decided that Papua New Guinea was here to stay and they might
                    find some good business here. So they started out with extending a line of
                    credit which was to be used for the purchase of coffee and then sales abroad.
                    Now I expect that has developed considerably, but it was interesting watching it
                    grow bit by bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were mentioning the host government officials and your
                        interaction with them. Would you repeat what you said about the fact that
                        you were not a young woman?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. I did not have any difficulties in dealing with the host country
                    officials, and I think it was an advantage that I was both a foreign woman and
                    an older woman. As I mentioned before, older women do have a status in the
                    traditional community that a young woman does not have. I saw my role as
                    developing a good working relationship with the foreign minister and with his
                    immediate subordinate, who was the secretary in the Department of Foreign
                    Affairs. I was fortunate in that both of these men were married to women who
                    were educated and who were strong figures. The wife of the foreign minister had
                    been educated as a nurse and had gone out of the home to work as a nurse.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>The story of their courtship, I might tell you as an aside, is really quite
                    interesting. As a young man, Albert Maori Kiki had gone to Fiji to study to
                    become a doctor. Well, he didn't pass his courses, so he became a medical
                    technician instead of a doctor. But while he was there, he became interested in
                    politics and decided he would also go into politics. At the same time, he
                    decided that he wanted to have a wife to help him in this, so he wrote a letter
                    to one of his relatives in Port Moresby, asking him to suggest someone who would
                    make a good wife for him. This relative suggested a woman named Elizabeth, who
                    was then studying nursing and came from the same area, same general background
                    that Albert Maori KiKi had. So he wrote her a letter saying that he wanted to
                    marry her. She was attending a Catholic school, was quite shocked by this, and
                    showed it to the nuns, and decided that she wouldn't answer him. Then he wrote
                    her a second letter, which she also showed. The nuns said to her, “Well, he
                    seems like a very sincere, honest man. Maybe you should answer.” But she was too
                    shy to do it. But he persisted and he was back in Port Moresby on vacation and
                    went around and looked her up and talked to her, and talked her into marrying.
                    That was the courtship. (Laughter)</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. And the wife of the secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs
                    was a university graduate, and she was working in the Department of Education.
                    She was an intelligent woman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These people became your personal friends, as well as
                        official friends?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had mentioned that you felt your role was to help
                        establish the U.S. presence there. They had been very favorably impressed by
                        Americans during the war, you said.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. I think the American troops were quite highly regarded during the
                    Second World War. They were generous and they obviously had much wealth in the
                    way of material possessions, which impressed the local people. As I may have
                    mentioned before, there were black officers in the American troops. That made a
                    favorable impression.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>But after [Douglas] MacArthur took the troops from Papua New Guinea into the
                    Philippines, there was no official American presence at all. Once in a while our
                    embassy in Canberra would send someone out to make a swing through Papua New
                    Guinea, and six months later the person would come back. But there was no
                    American official who was resident in Papua New Guinea until I opened our post
                    in 1974. Consequently, I thought that one of the most important things I could
                    do to establish good relations would be to portray the United States as having a
                    sympathetic and friendly interest in a small emerging country. Consequently, I
                    spent a great deal of time on what was essentially public relations work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Representation in the sense of representing your
                        country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, a very broad sense of representation. At the time of independence,
                    lots and lots of small ceremonies were taking place: the introduction of the new
                    currency, the turnover by the Australians of certain military equipment. I was
                    invited—the diplomatic corps was invited to these things, and I made a point to
                    go to them, to demonstrate my interest. Not all of the diplomatic corps did, but
                    I was always there. When they introduced the new currency, I had a twenty-dollar
                    bill that I could take up to the teller and change into the new currency, and
                    the Finance Minister said later it made him feel very good to see someone
                    changing an important currency like American dollars into kina.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How nice!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I tried to entertain more broadly than I think a diplomat ordinarily
                    does. They had a women's conference in Port Moresby drawing in women from all
                    over the country, and I had a reception for the women and displayed some
                    photographs and printed material and so on from the American women's movement.
                    When I gave large receptions, I tried to include university students and some of
                    the more junior people from the government. I did a lot of traveling, and we
                    visited schools and went to whatever they thought was appropriate to go to.</p>
                <p>I visited places in the country that most diplomats don't go to. I took a
                    seven-day trip in a dug-out canoe on the Sepik River, and spent the nights in
                    little haus kiaps [huts on stilts] along the way and looked at the artwork and
                    the haus tambarans [spirit houses] and so on. I made sure that I got out of the
                    narrow proper diplomatic circuit as it was traditionally viewed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You seem to have had a tremendous understanding of the

                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: I found them very interesting people, and did a lot of reading. One of
                    my friends was the head of the Anthropology Department at the University of
                    Papua New Guinea, an American woman. I talked with her many, many times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must have been very helpful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. She had done a lot of field work. She had spent fourteen years
                    there. As I say, I tried to get out of the beaten path.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you have your USIS person do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Initially we did not have a USIS person. USIA refused to send someone
                    out for the opening of the post, and my political officer spent about half his
                    time and did, really, a very good job in stimulating activities. It wasn't until
                    I had been there, I suppose, two years that we finally had a USIS officer
                    assigned to the Embassy. He, of course, was more active and had more experience
                    than the other, and he did an excellent job.</p>
                <p>One of the things we did was to put in a little amphitheater on the hillside
                    behind the chancery. There we had American films twice a week, free. Sometimes
                    we had things by invitation only, but a lot of them were open to anyone who
                    wanted to come.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you open a library?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, eventually we opened a library. It must have been nearly a year
                    after the USIA officer got there that we were able to get that set up. He
                    established contacts with the university and the schools and so on. We had a
                    very active program of leadership grants, and we certainly managed to send to
                    the United States a lot of people who became important in government. That was,
                    I felt, a very important contribution that we made.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did any visiting American musicians come?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: We didn't have very much in that way, but we did manage to get a Navy
                    band to put on three nights of concerts for us, and those were very popular,
                    very popular indeed. It was a dance band, and they put on the big time music.
                    What do they call it? The music of about thirty years ago, thirty or forty years
                    ago.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: The “big band”. That's the phrase I'm thinking of, yes. We had a few
                    others. We had people coming through giving lectures, not all of which were well
                    attended, but some of them were, and we did get some good people coming to
                    them.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, I thought by and large they did. They tended to be quite young and
                    rather gung-ho, but I sometimes had to hold onto their coat-tails. I'd rather
                    have that sort of a person in a post like Port Moresby than those who had become
                    old and cynical and even embittered.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I dare say that many of them had asked to go there, hadn't

                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. It was considered a very exotic place and the word got back that
                    the assignments there were good assignments. They had the chance to do real
                    things. I had an economic officer there who had completed the work for his Ph.D.
                    at the University of Minnesota and was on his first assignment. He set up his
                    own little shop and presented me with an outline of what he wanted to
                    accomplish, and I told him to go to it. He had a very free hand and he found it
                    a very rewarding assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can imagine. Did you take particular steps to see that
                        the very junior officers received proper training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, to the extent that I could. But they were doing the training
                    themselves, actually. We had a brand-new local staff with no experience
                    whatsoever, and the junior officers, I thought, did an excellent job in training
                    the local staff and encouraging them. My secretary taught them touch-typing and
                    the officers encouraged them to take correspondence courses, one in commercial
                    work, another in consular work from Washington, and helped them with it, and
                    they helped them with their English. They gave them responsibility. I think we
                    had a loyalty from our local staff that was the envy of the diplomatic
                    community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can imagine!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: There was a very high rate of turnover among the local employees in Port
                    Moresby, not only of the diplomatic staffs, but throughout. After a young person
                    had been on the job for six months, he looked around for what else he could get
                    that would be new and interesting and pay better. By giving them more
                    responsibility, by teaching them, by giving them increases, we held onto ours.
                    It turned out to be very effective.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Olmsted, could you tell us more about the
                        seven-day trip you took, that you mentioned in the last session that we
                        had?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. I became friendly with the chairman of the Department of
                    Anthropology at the University of Papua New Guinea. She was an American woman
                    who had been in Papua New Guinea about fourteen years. She had done extensive
                    fieldwork, particularly in the small islands and in the coastal areas, and she
                    had a wealth of information about Papua New Guinea. I enjoyed her very much and
                    learned a great deal from her. Once I said to her that if she were going off on
                    a field trip and needed someone to carry her briefcase, or the anthropologist
                    equivalent thereof, that I would like to join her. She thought that was a good
                    idea, and talked to another friend of hers who was the wife of the head of the
                    Geography Department at the University of Papua New Guinea. Annje Clark was her
                    name. She was a German who was married to an American, Bill Clark.</p>
                <p>So the three of us started making plans for some sort of a jaunt, and we finally
                    decided that we would do what is known as the Middle Sepik, which is the middle
                    section of the Sepik River, a very long river that runs slowly through the
                    western part of Papua New Guinea and finally enters the sea along the north
                    coast.</p>
                <p>Annje Clark had been taking a series of lecture courses at the university in the
                    art of Papua New Guinea, and she said that she would be willing to do a good
                    deal of the planning of the trip, so that worked out very nicely. Ann Chowning
                    had the extensive background. Anjie would make the plans for where we should
                    stop and what we should look at on the Sepik River, and I went along as a more
                    or less freeloader on this expedition.</p>
                <p>We flew to Wewak on the north coast and hired a Land Rover which drove us to the
                    site where we were to get our canoe. We were planning to hire a motorized dugout
                    canoe. We had sent a message ahead to a man who rented such canoes, and to our
                    dismay, when we arrived in Wewak, discovered he had received our message only
                    that morning. However, fortunately, he said that he could accommodate us.</p>
                <p>So we took a day's trip over very bad roads in the Land Rover to get to the point
                    where we would start our journey. We rented a 43-foot dugout canoe with seats on
                    the floor and backrests, which was a great advantage, an outboard motor, and
                    extra supplies of gasoline and a crew of two young fellows who must have been in
                    their late teens. Not long after we started out, we picked up a third crew
                    member, who was a freeloader, a friend of the two boys who were our crew, and we
                    had no objection with him going along. He joined in and helped with the work as
                    well.</p>
                <p>The Sepik River is a slow-moving, wide river which frequently changes its course.
                    There are reeds in many areas and it's quite swampy in many places. The boys
                    frequently thought they knew a shortcut going from one curve of the river to
                    another, but we regularly got stuck in the reeds as we were trying to save time.
                    I don't think we saved any time at all.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>We spent the first night in a house that had been occupied by the district
                    officer, but there was no one living it in at the time. It was terribly dirty, a
                    very, very messy place, but we put our bedrolls on top of the beds and put up
                    our mosquito nettings, which are very essential in that area, and cooked a
                    little dinner. Then the next morning, we had cold rice and bully beef for
                    breakfast, and that was the beginning that gave me an idea of what our cuisine
                    was likely to be for the remainder of the trip.</p>
                <p>We started off well loaded down with our gear and the extra gasoline. We took
                    some food along, but we had expected we would be able to buy food from the
                    people as we went down the river. This proved, however, to be a mistaken
                    impression, because the rains had been either early or late—I've forgotten
                    which—and the crops were delayed. Consequently the local people had very little
                    food to sell. Our diet was rather limited.</p>
                <p>We stopped at various places that Annje had planned for us to stop, to look at
                    haus tambarans, which are the spirit houses. They are closer to churches than
                    anything else, but it's not exactly the same. They were used for religious
                    purposes originally. We wondered whether they were still being used for
                    religious purposes, even though the area was nominally Christian, and suspected
                    that due to the good condition they were in, they probably were. At one place we
                    stopped, a Catholic church had been built encompassing some of the carvings from
                    the haus tambaran, which apparently was no longer existing. It is rather
                    startling to see this large Catholic church made of corrugated iron roof and
                    open sides, with these magnificent carvings of pagan deities and whatnot in it,
                    but it was very clever of whoever made the decision, I think, to encompass them,
                    to encourage the people to participate in the church.</p>
                <p>We stopped at various villages, as I say, to look at the haus tambarans and also
                    other carvings. Some villages were particularly noted for their carvings. It's
                    quite interesting to walk through these villages and sometimes see, just
                    standing out, fenceposts that had been carved, really very beautifully carved,
                    and sometimes there would be a very handsome figure of an ancestor or deity or
                    something of the sort just standing there. The haus tambarans are not very
                    substantially built. Many of them are quite high, some of them as much as sixty
                    feet high, entirely built of local materials, that is, forest materials, no
                    nails or anything like that in them. The front is usually painted with the faces
                    of ancestors. You often enter a haus tambaran through a very narrow aperture
                    often, although some of them are completely open at the lower level and you have
                    to go up a ladder to get to the second floor, which may be the more important
                    place. In a few of them, they didn't want us to enter, and we were very, very
                    careful to follow directions.</p>
                <p>Outside some of them are sacred rocks, and we were told, “Don't touch the sacred
                    rocks.” Believe me, we followed the instructions very, very carefully. These
                    rocks would be quite different from anything that you would see in that area,
                    and no one knew where they came from or how they had been brought there or when
                    or by whom, but obviously they'd been there for a long time.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>We spent the night, each night, at a haus kiap which is a house made of native
                    materials, always on stilts, and built so that government people or others could
                    have a place to stay, because these are really traditional villages with no
                    hotels, no facilities. There was no electricity, there was no running water,
                    nothing like that. There is nothing in a haus kiap. It's absolutely empty. You
                    go up a ladder and the floors are made of palm branches and are not very
                    substantial. You have to be very careful or you'll step through. If you do step
                    through, you're very likely to get a bad scratch on your leg, and if you do
                    that, it's very likely to get infected. I had already had one topical ulcer and
                    that certainly made me very careful not to run the risk of getting a second
                    one.</p>
                <p>We would unload our gear and get settled in the haus kiap, and then usually walk
                    around the village for a little while and talk to people. Ann Chowning spoke
                    excellent pidgin, which was widely spoken in that area, and she was the
                    interpreter for us. She said to me that it was very hard for her to explain in
                    pidgin who I was. They understood that she was from the university. They had
                    heard about the university, and she even ran into one or two of her former
                    students. She explained that Annje was the wife of another professor at the
                    university. But to explain what an American ambassador was, was just beyond her.
                    (Laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How large were these villages, as a rule?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Oh, anyplace from 50 to 500 people. One of them might have been
                    1,000.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it a tribal unit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: A clan unit. There are many, many languages spoken along the Sepik
                    River. A tribe usually describes a language group. It has no political
                    significance. The clan is the largest group that has a political
                    significance.</p>
                <p>We would walk around the village and talk to people, and then come back and fix
                    our dinner. The boys with us would go someplace else, and they usually had
                    friends or relatives or could make acquaintances and would be put up in
                    somebody's house. When we walked around the village, we frequently asked if we
                    could go into a house and look at it, and the people were quite willing to have
                    us do that. It was very interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are they like?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: Most of them are quite large. They're houses on stilts, and you climb up
                    a ladder and enter into a quite dark but rather large sort of loft area. They're
                    not divided by rooms; everything is out. The mosquitoes are extremely bad in
                    that area, just dreadful. This was a problem for them, and they often left a
                    lighted fire for the smoke to drive the mosquitoes away. The fires were built in
                    a pottery dish, a large dish, curved, which is typical of that area. They're
                    quite handsome pieces. The smoke would just go up from them and filter out
                    through the roofs. I don't remember if they had any chimneys. In one place we
                    saw something that is traditional in that area, but not used very much anymore
                    as a means of keeping away from the mosquitoes at night, and that is a large
                    tube that the whole family would crawl into. It's sort of a crocheted tube, and
                    the whole family would get in that to stay away from the mosquitoes.</p>
                <p>In one place we saw where they were having a little ceremony to drive the
                    mosquitoes out, and the ceremony consisted of a group of young people running
                    through the village with flares and with anything that would make noise.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Noise will drive them away? (Laughter)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Well, that was the theory. It made me think of the old saying, “Don't
                    just stand there; do something.” And they were doing something, however
                    ineffective it might be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Isn't that touching!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Another place, a ceremony was being held to celebrate the maturity of a
                    little girl, the puberty ceremony. They said we could come in and watch part of
                    it. The women of the village were singing and dancing; this would go on all
                    night, and then at dawn they would take her out to the stream, where they would
                    ritually bathe her. They said we could not go to that. I didn't want to stay up
                    that late, anyhow. (Laughter) It was quite interesting watching this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At what age do the girls become women?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I would say ten, eleven, along in there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are they marriageable at that age?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Marriage customs differ in different parts of the country. I would say
                    that in some cases they would probably marry fairly soon thereafter, and in
                    other places probably not.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>Then we continued on down the river. We took a branch off the river at one place
                    to visit what is known as the black water area, called because it has very dark
                    water in it, and we could see the reflections of the buildings and the trees in
                    the waters. Very, very pretty. The water was quite cool, and we went in swimming
                    and had a nice excursion there.</p>
                <p>In another place, we wanted to get out of the canoe and walk to a village about
                    five miles away to see the kinds of pottery that they made there, which was
                    somewhat different from other pottery in that area. So we walked along on a path
                    through the forest for about five miles and crossed many streams on rickety
                    little bridges, or else we crossed on logs that had been put down, and finally
                    got to the village. I was rather tired by that time, so they sent a little boy
                    up a coconut tree and he brought down some coconuts. They sliced them open and
                    we drank the coconut milk. It was cool and it tasted so good.</p>
                <p>Then we looked at what they had in the way of pottery. I'll show you one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are the potters the men or the women or both?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Mostly women, but I'm sure in some places there are men, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is nice. [Referring to pottery]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: This is a completely utilitarian piece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, that is stunning.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: It is used to put around the fire, and you put your pot on two or three
                    of these. You see there are holes in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of like a trivet.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. There are holes here and you put vines, string two or three of them
                    with vines to hold them together, and then you put your pot on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Has that one been used?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's dark. Is that the color they bake it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I think it's the color they bake it. One of the interesting things about
                    this is how they decorate the most utilitarian things. I understand
                    anthropologists say that a primitive people will usually perfect the item
                    technically before they decorate it, but in Papua New Guinea they decorate it
                    first. They are very artistic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very artistic people, yes. They must be. What are the
                        meanings of those markings? Do they tattoo themselves?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: In some places. They paint very extensively, but in some places they do
                    tattoo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that supposed to represent a hearth god or a goddess?
                        It's a person, obviously.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I don't know. I would doubt that it has any religious significance. I
                    think that they're just so in the habit of decorating things that when they made
                    this, they just put a face on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's charming. Did you buy this at that village?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. So we continued down until we got to the point where we had
                    arranged for a car to come and pick us up. In our last stop, I've forgotten the
                    name of the village, which was a larger village, there was a little motel there.
                    It was a not very impressive hotel, but it looked great to us, and we were able
                    to take showers. (Laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Must have been sheer joy! (Laughter)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. And we sat down and had a table and had a meal brought to us. That
                    seemed like a really big thing.</p>
                <p>But I should mention that at one of the villages where we stopped, we had a
                    letter to an artist in that village who had actually traveled abroad to show his
                    things. He'd gone to some conference in Mexico that the government had arranged
                    for him to go to. When we gave him the letter, he was very interested and
                    invited us to have dinner with him and his family. He served us turtle. I didn't
                    care much for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean a boiled turtle?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably chewy, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, it was. It was. Then the next night, why, he again invited us, and
                    for that occasion, he went out and shot a wild pig, so we had pork.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had said that pigs were very important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. It's a sign of wealth. It's a way of accumulating wealth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's something that's always transferable, I suppose. It's
                        liquid wealth. (Laughter)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. The vehicle that came to pick us up was not a jeep, which was
                    really needed in those areas, but a passenger car. Very shortly after we got
                    started, it got badly stuck in the mud, and all three of us had to get out and
                    push. (Laughter) Deep mud. And we were sorry that there wasn't someone there to
                    take a picture of us for the final hour of our trip.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I should say! Did you take any pictures while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Oh, yes. I took a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't think I would have enjoyed the mosquitoes and the
                        insects, but otherwise it sounds like a wonderful trip. One other thing that
                        you mentioned the other day that I would like to ask you more about is the
                        amphitheater that you said you put in. The U.S. had brought property, had
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No. We leased and made an arrangement with an Australian firm there to
                    build our chancery which they built according to our specifications on the upper
                    end of a steeply slanting lot. The chancery is very close to the street, and
                    behind us we had quite an area of land which was being used for nothing. Every
                    time I looked at it, I began wishing we could somehow develop it. So eventually
                    we came up with the idea of putting in a small amphitheater.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What a clever idea!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: Where films could be shown and other entertainment provided; lectures
                    and education and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have it terraced and have benches put on the
                        terraces?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: It was slightly terraced and benches were put in. There was a little
                    stage with large logs behind it to form the background for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The weather was such that except in the rainy season, I
                        suppose, you could use it all the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What a wonderful idea! I'm surprised you could talk FBO
                        [Foreign Buildings Office] into it. (Laughter)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The other day we were discussing your carrying out policy in Papua New Guinea. I
                    wondered if we could pick up there. We did talk about your representing the
                    United States to the people, and the necessity for USIS in getting to know the
                    people.</p>
                <p>OLMSTED: In addition to that, I was in touch with the government of Papua New
                    Guinea on various items that were coming up in the UN, and asking for their
                    support such matters. I found, generally speaking, that either they would
                    abstain or would be willing to vote along with us. There were a lot of matters
                    that they felt, as a new country, they did not want to get tangled up in, and
                    they didn't want to devote their rather scarce resources of trained manpower
                    struggling with certain international problems that they felt did not affect
                    them. But on the other hand, where there was something that would affect them or
                    that they had a broad interest in, they were certainly willing to listen to what
                    I had to say, and often did support our position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in other words, the business of the UN is really
                        conducted back in the country of origin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: In a case like Papua New Guinea, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they have a representative at the UN?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: They initially had an ambassador in Washington, who was also accredited
                    to the UN. Later on they moved him to New York when they got more interested in
                    UN business, and he would visit Washington from time to time, but his main
                    business was in the UN. He became very interested in the UN, and he felt there
                    was a role that Papua New Guinea could play. He observed that there were some
                    small new countries which were reaching some prominence in the UN by achieving
                    positions of one sort or another, and he became a vice president of the UN, no
                    small feat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose they leave their people at posts a lot longer
                        than we do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, yes. Sometimes they do, not always. He stayed for quite a
                    while.</p>
                <p>Another problem that affected the relations between Papua New Guinea and the
                    United States quite seriously came about just at the time of independence. That
                    was the problem of the secessionist movement on Bougainville Island.
                    Bougainville is the most easterly of all the islands out from the main island.
                    It's the furthest away from Port Moresby of any of them. The people there
                    generally have a darker skin than most Papua New Guineans. The Bougainvilleans
                    generally call other Papua New Guineans, Redskins. They felt that they were
                    different, and they felt that they had been neglected because they were the
                    furthest away.</p>
                <p>Then in the 1960s it was discovered that there was an important copper deposit on
                    Bougainville, and the firm of Bechtel was called in to develop it, although the
                    mine was owned and managed by a multinational subsidiary of ConRioTinto Zinc, a
                    Spanish firm. It was the Australian subsidiary of that Spanish firm that
                    actually managed the mine.</p>
                <p>A good many difficulties came about in the construction of the mine, because it
                    was necessary to obtain land where the copper deposit was found. Land is
                    clan-owned and very, very deeply cherished, and it was extremely difficult to
                    persuade people to give up their land. Further, damage done to the environment
                    when the tailings of the copper ore were washed down. It destroyed fishing, and
                    there was destruction of some good agricultural land. There were very strong
                    feelings about that.</p>
                <p>Well, when Papua New Guinea reached the point of becoming independent,
                    Bougainville started talking about becoming independent from Papua New Guinea.
                    There were three leaders of this movement. One of them was a Catholic priest.
                    One of them had been a Catholic priest, but left the priesthood in order to
                    marry an American woman who had been a nun. The third had at one point studied
                    to become a priest, but had not ever entered the priesthood.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these all Papua New Guineans?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: All Papua New Guineans. Bougainville was very strongly Catholic—the
                    other churches were not important there—and the Catholic bishop was an American
                    citizen. Other Americans were also in the church hierarchy as missionaries.
                    Consequently, there was a certain involvement of Americans in the secessionist
                    movement right from the start. I don't think the church ever officially
                    sanctioned the secessionist movement, but it was known that there were
                    considerable sympathies among many of the people in the Catholic Church for the
                    secessionist movement.</p>
                <p>Well, the central government became increasingly perturbed over the American role
                    in the secessionist movement. It was very important to the central government
                    that Bougainville should not secede. The psychological impact of secession would
                    lead other parts of the country to want to secede. And in addition to that, the
                    royalties being paid to the central government from the copper mine were a very
                    important part of the national income, of the government's income.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This Catholic bishop that you're speaking of, he was an
                        American citizen, but he was a Papua New Guinean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No, he was an American citizen who was there as a missionary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. He was a missionary. But he let it be known,
                        directly or indirectly. . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. I'm not sure he ever came out officially, but it was believed that
                    he and other American missionaries in Bougainville were very sympathetic toward
                    the cause.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They felt the United States was actually intervening to
                        stir up trouble?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: The central government was very suspicious of that. They feared there
                    was CIA intervention. I kept telling them that there was not, but the rumors
                    went on and on. I was at a government reception one evening and one of the
                    senior Australians came over and told me that there had been a cabinet meeting
                    that day at which the CIA's role in the Bougainville secessionist movement had
                    been discussed. It was extremely hard to prove a negative. I saw the prime
                    minister, who was, I thought, very cool towards me, and I said, “I've got to do
                    something about this.” So I went over and talked to him.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>I pointed out to the prime minister that there was very little American interest,
                    just a minuscule American financial interest in the Bougainville copper mine. I
                    said, “We have just no reason to want to support the secessionist movement.” Of
                    course, they were concerned over the fact that some of the secessionist leaders
                    were going to the United States to get sympathy at the UN. The day after I saw
                    the prime minister at the reception, I called on the foreign minister and
                    discussed the matter considerably further with him. I explained to him that it
                    would be extremely difficult for us to refuse to issue visas particularly to the
                    secessionist leader who was married to an American citizen. I explained that
                    under our laws and regulations, it's almost impossible to refuse to issue a visa
                    to the spouse of an American citizen. So I said, “We'll have to go ahead and do
                    it, but we will keep you informed.” Therefore, after that, I always let them
                    know if we had issued a visa to any of the secessionists, and I think they
                    appreciated that. But there were all kinds of wild rumors about the Eighth Fleet
                    being just over the horizon with 30,000 men on it, ready to take over
                    Bougainville. Just incredible rumors going around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you say, how do you fight a negative?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, yes. I was very particular that CIA people should not visit Papua
                    New Guinea. Some of them wanted to, and I had rather strained relations with our
                    embassy in Canberra because I just said, “We can't have it.”</p>
                <p>Another thing that happened about that same time, two warrant officers from the
                    Army were going to the Solomon Islands in connection with a longstanding
                    scientific project, but we received no notice of their arrival. One of my young
                    officers happened to be having a drink at a bar and fell into conversation and
                    discovered these two American military men were going to go to the Solomon
                    Islands, stopping overnight in Bougainville on their way, and carrying all kinds
                    of strange boxes and parcels in connection with their scientific mission.</p>
                <p>So I said, “Get those men down to my office now.” He did so, and they came in,
                    and they were very reasonable young fellows just doing their job, not at all
                    aware that there was any problem connected with this. I said that they would
                    just have to stay in Port Moresby a few days longer and take a direct flight to
                    the Solomon Islands, do their business there, and take a direct flight out, and
                    not stop in Bougainville.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lucky you found out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: It certainly was, because it would have been terribly hard to
                    explain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, because they would be certain that you knew all the
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, yes. So as time passed the Bougainville issue was settled and
                    Bougainville stayed as part of Papua New Guinea and the secessionist movement
                    died down and everything blew over. But it was a very uncomfortable period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been. Was this an ongoing thing when you went
                        out there, or did it come up after you had been there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: It came up after I arrived there, because it was at the time that Papua
                    New Guinea decided to press for independence. That was the time that the
                    Bougainvilleans decided that they wanted to be independent of Papua New
                    Guinea.</p>
                <p>The next big policy issue I faced came a couple of years later, and that was the
                    question of fisheries. There are rich tuna fishing areas in the Pacific around
                    Papua New Guinea, the Solomons, and other islands. Fishing had become more
                    difficult off South America and Central America for the American tuna fleet. As
                    you may remember, some of our tuna vessels were seized, and there were
                    difficulties of one sort or another. I think there was probably some overfishing
                    there too. The American tuna fleet started to come into the South Pacific waters
                    looking for better fishing. This posed a very considerable problem. We have some
                    very punitive legislation on the books in the form of the Magnuson Act, which
                    provides that if an American vessel is seized, the United States shall forbid
                    the importation of fish or fish products from that country. I don't remember the
                    full details of the Magnuson Act now, but it posed a great big problem for us.
                    The Pacific island countries wanted to get together to establish a fisheries
                    unit which could police their waters and keep out the American tuna boats and
                    other tuna boats. They had a big problem with the Taiwanese people who were
                    coming in and fishing in their waters, too. This was further complicated by the
                    fact that Papua New Guinea, like some of the other island countries, had
                    established a 200-mile limit, which the United States didn't recognize. This
                    problem affected both Papua New Guinea and the Solomon Islands and continued
                    until I left, and my successors are still struggling with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Washington give you a free hand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No, not at all. In the question of the fisheries, Washington kept us
                    very poorly informed. The people who were running the fisheries problem back in
                    Washington were mostly people without much Foreign Service experience, and they
                    thought they could best handle it by going occasionally to conferences and doing
                    the work with representatives of these little countries at the conferences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this the Maritime Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: No, this is the OES [Oceans and International Environment and Scientific
                    Affairs]. They wanted to leave the embassies pretty much out of it. Well, as the
                    days passed, it became increasingly clear that this was a dreadful mistake, and
                    it was only late in the game that they began giving us the information that we
                    needed and clueing us in on what was going on. During that time, the opinions of
                    the island countries began to solidify, and we weren't able to cope with it
                    because we just didn't have the information. I think that was a disastrous
                    mistake insofar as these small countries were concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously you were not given adequate policy guidance by
                        the Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: It wasn't only adequate policy guidance; they didn't send us the basic
                    documents we needed. We finally got a copy of the Magnuson Act by sending down
                    to our consulate general in Sydney, which had federal records. It was a very,
                    very short-sighted policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While all of these things were going on, did it create
                        enough of a stir back home so that you had any reporters coming through,
                        newspaper reporters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: We did not have many reporters. No, it did not stir up that sort of
                    problem. At independence there were a few reporters who came out, but it's so
                    far away from the United States that we didn't have many. Once in a while, a
                    writer would come through, more likely a magazine writer than a newspaper
                    writer, doing an article.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When that happened, the person would check in at the
                        embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: At least some of them did, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were consular matters a problem at your post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Not in the way they are at many posts. With 3,000 resident Americans,
                    you might expect a fairly lively consular responsibility, but our Americans were
                    mostly missionaries, most of whom had been in the country for many years, knew
                    their way around, and were not inclined to get into trouble. So we issued visas,
                    we issued passports, we replaced lost passports, we issued certificates of
                    birth, and issued passports to children born there, and that sort of thing.
                    Getting an American out of jail was a pretty rare occasion.</p>
                <p>There was one person—I think an anthropologist or a linguist, I can't remember
                    which now, who grew marijuana in her back yard. She was quietly asked to leave,
                    but it was done without big fanfare, and the person involved agreed to go.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No, to smoke and give to her friends. But the government was very eager
                    that drugs should not get started there. They did not have a drug problem and
                    did not want to have one. There were a few little things like that, but not very
                    much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Visas, I suppose, weren't much of a problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No. Almost no immigration visas. We issued visitors' visas mainly to
                    people who were traveling for the government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said you had some leadership grants. What sort of
                        visas would they go on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: They went on visitors' visas, unless they were government officials, in
                    which case they might get an official visa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't have student visas?</hi>

                <p>OLMSTED: (Laughter) No, of course not.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: There was a certain amount of rivalry among the young officers who were
                    jockeying for position. A little of that, I think, is a good thing. I think a
                    little tension keeps them on their toes and keeps them moving. By and large, it
                    wasn't a serious matter. We had some very promising young officers there, and
                    then some who were not so promising.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any fallout among the wives? Oftentimes when

                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: We had a number of single people there, and there were sufficiently few
                    wives that I don't remember problems arising.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they occupy their time? With their children, if

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. Some of them worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No, no. One of them got a job as sort of an office manager for a firm in
                    Port Moresby, and one of them was offered a job teaching school but became
                    pregnant and didn't take it. Another played golf and spent her time improving
                    her golf game and enjoying life. Another just stayed home and wasn't interested
                    in working.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you didn't have any problems such as are encountered in

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No, people managed to stay quite busy in Port Moresby. The secretaries
                    enjoyed Port Moresby very much. They found that they were swept into an active,
                    informal social life, which included a lot of outdoor activities, a lot of
                    boating and swimming. One played squash and another golf, and so on. So they
                    managed to stay quite busy and enjoyed themselves thoroughly.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: My first officer, I think, was quite good; he was very quick. He was the
                    advance man who set up the post. He did very well. He was replaced by an officer
                    who was not good, who didn't want to come to the post, disliked it thoroughly,
                    and wanted to get out, was just very antagonistic. He was a real problem. Then
                    he was replaced by someone, again, who did like the post and was happy
                    there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: It was cut short by six months. I might mention we had a rather
                    surprising variety of foreign wives. One was of Dutch origin, another was Lao,
                    and another was a Moroccan.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: That's right. There was one AID representative in Fiji, who covered the
                    South Pacific, and we'd have visits from him. We did not have a direct AID
                    program. We granted aid to some of the voluntary agencies which, in turn, had
                    small projects, some of which were quite interesting projects. It was very small
                    stuff, though.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The reason that you didn't have AID was because the people
                        themselves didn't want it? It seems as though there would be scope for roads
                        or electricity projects, that sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: A decision was made in Washington, at the time the post was opened, that
                    Australia would be the big aid figure and the big figure, generally, in that
                    area, and that we would not compete. Therefore, it was my job to say again and
                    again and again, “No, we are not going to supply aid to Papua New Guinea.” It
                    was rather an interesting situation, rather unusual in the American Foreign
                    Service, to recognize consciously that another country is the big power in a
                    given area, and that we are definitely playing the smaller role. It did pose
                    some problems for me. On the one hand, I wanted to follow the policy, which I
                    felt was the right one. On the other hand, I did not want to appear to be in the
                    hip pocket of the Australian High Commissioner. I made every effort to keep the
                    Australian High Commissioner informed of things that might come to my attention
                    that he might not know about, but at the same time, I never went from the
                    Foreign Minister's office to the Australian High Commissioner's office on the
                    same trip. I always saw to it that there was some lapse in time.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: Well, I was fully aware that everybody in town knew me and that I was a

                <p>OLMSTED: No. I also knew that there was a very considerable grapevine among the
                    servants and among other groups, too. I knew that my house boy came from a
                    village that was very close to the village that the police commissioner came
                    from, and I knew that my house boy had relatives who worked for the Indonesian
                    ambassador. There were all these little cross-currents that made me warn my
                    staff that they'd better be careful in what they did and where they did it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: We had an inspection about five weeks after we became an embassy, and
                    this was a bit of a strain. After independence, we were all exhausted. Yet we
                    had to get ready for this inspection. The inspectors arrived on schedule and
                    really treated us very well. They said they thought we were better established
                    than they had expected we would be at that point. They particularly praised us
                    for having hired Papua New Guineans as our local staff. The chief inspector said
                    to me that he was fully prepared to give me a lecture on having hired
                    third-country nationals in my office, and he was very pleased to see all the
                    dark faces when he walked in.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, we had another inspection later on. I believe it was five
                    inspectors on the second one, which is a bit much for a staff of seven to cope
                    with.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. By and large, yes.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: The first group, I think, stayed for a couple of weeks, and the second

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: When I left there, I felt considerable satisfaction in believing that
                    the United States Government had made its official presence known and recognized
                    in a way that was entirely acceptable to the Papua New Guineans. I thought that
                    the opening chapter of our relationship had been a good chapter and that I was
                    known and respected and well regarded. I felt that was the most important thing
                    to accomplish, and I felt I had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very good. Can you think of any way in which your being a
                        woman helped in your being able to accomplish this so well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I don't know as this really answers the question, but not long before I
                    left, one of the people that I dealt with in the government said to me that if I
                    didn't know it, I would be interested in knowing that my appointment there had
                    caused a good deal of discussion within the government of Papua New Guinea. The
                    conclusion that the government people reached was that if a big and important
                    country like the United States was sending women abroad as their
                    representatives, giving them high positions, Papua New Guinea should also have
                    women that it could name to high positions. He said that my appointment there
                    had given a real impetus to the improvement of the position of Papua New Guinean
                    women.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose up until that time, they just weren't in the
                        government at all, were they, the women?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Not very much. There were very few. But I think that, as I say, my being
                    there did help get them into the government.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: Yes.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess that would be the reason why it made things more
                        difficult that you were a woman when you went there, because in that society
                        women stayed home. You must have had to work harder.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Maybe so. I don't know. I didn't feel that being a woman was a great
                    handicap there. Papua New Guineans are very conservative people and they don't
                    jump to rash conclusions. They don't reach decisions readily. They're willing to
                    sit back and think things over and observe before they come to a conclusion. I
                    think that in my opening months, perhaps even the first year or so, they looked
                    me over very carefully and decided that I was their friend and that they could
                    trust me and that I was all right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you just do this all by instinct, Ambassador, this
                        gradual way that you got them to trust you, by showing your interest in

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Oh, I think so. I don't think I thought it over very carefully. I was
                    very interested in the country, so it was not hard for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the key.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. It was very genuine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever discover why it was decided to send a woman
                        as the first American Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I went there as consul general, and I went there because I wanted to and
                    because I was able to persuade the department to send me. Then I was in Port
                    Moresby when the decision was made that I would be the ambassador, but I'm not
                    familiar with what went into that decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But of course, when you went there, it was pretty well
                        known that it was going to become independent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, but I had no commitments that I would be the first ambassador. I
                    didn't ask for them and I didn't get them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have been doing a good job. Getting back to the
                        more personal side of things: in the running of your household, you have
                        told me about your staff. How much supervision did you have to give
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Quite a bit. There were certain basic things that my house-boy knew how
                    to do, but to present him with something new, with his limited English and his
                    limited understanding, that was quite a problem. For a while, as I may have
                    mentioned, I had a cook, John Veale, who was an excellent cook, and I thought
                    very highly of him in some regards, but quite the reverse in others. He had been
                    a cook in a restaurant or a hotel, and he was really a very good cook, very
                    imaginative in what he prepared. He would decorate a table just beautifully and
                    he'd strew small orchids across the table. He would arrange fruit flowing out of
                    a basket on a side table, so it just looked like a picture. I was very happy
                    with that side of it. But he wasn't dependable. Sometimes he would just
                    disappear, and once in a while I had to go out in the kitchen and do the cooking
                    because he hadn't appeared for a dinner party. And I can tell you that didn't
                    make me very happy. Also he helped himself very liberally to anything in the
                    kitchen or the store-room that he could get his hands on, and my bills went up
                    and up and up. Finally, we reached a parting of the ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You handled the accounts, obviously. Your household
                        accounts, you had to keep those accounts yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, and I did a certain amount of the shopping, as well. Sometimes I'd
                    take the house boy along and we'd do it jointly. Sometimes I'd do it by myself.
                    But I depended a good deal on caterers for my official entertaining, and, of
                    course, that meant that I'd just get the bill.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, there were some caterers there, some of them not entirely
                    dependable, but we all used them.</p>

                    the Chinese restaurant.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No. I would say all of us, the Americans, were really quite healthy. One
                    of our staff members had a chronic sore throat problem, which continued there.
                    Another had a longstanding skin ailment or skin problem which surfaced again in
                    Papua New Guinea. Skin problems are common.</p>

                    one of our staff members had a baby there, and the doctors thought she shouldn't
                    have. Afterwards they said she should have been evacuated to have the child.</p>

                    country were, to a considerable extent, missionary-run, but the one in Port
                    Moresby was a government hospital. There were several Australian doctors in
                    town, and there was one Chinese-Australian doctor. There was a small medical

                    years we did. We tried different things. It wasn't always the same. One year we

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, at the residence both times. I found that very tiring, two parties
                    in one day. So I tried to avoid that and have them on different days, but we
                    ordinarily did have one reception that was either primarily or entirely for
                    Americans, and one which was for the official community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you obtain things such as books and periodicals
                        and health supplies and beauty products and so forth? Were they available
                        locally?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: A surprising number of things were available locally, and yet there were
                    gaps in supplies that were also surprising. I can remember one of the young
                    married men on the staff came back after he had gone out to do some Christmas
                    shopping and reported that there were nine brands of French perfume available in
                    town. Cosmetics were available, not everything, but a lot of things. Medical
                    supplies, the over-the-counter types of drugs, and preparations of one sort or
                    another, usually made in Australia, were fairly freely available, not the newest
                    things, but the standards, I would say.</p>
                <p>As for prescription medicine, I think people brought things with them that they
                    specifically needed or perhaps had them sent in. One of my young officers with a
                    fungus skin condition had drugs sent from the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And books and periodicals? Did you have a bookstore back
                        here that supplied you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Time magazine, Newsweek were both available on the newsstands, the
                    Australian edition of both of them. There were some other magazines. Psychology
                    Today was available. There were some of the other American periodicals and also
                    a number of Australian periodicals. For the daily paper I read one of the
                    Australian papers in addition to the Post Courier, which was the Papua New
                    Guinean tabloid-size paper.</p>
                <p>For books, I myself counted on picking up what I wanted when I was back in the
                    States. I was back every year, so I did buy what I wanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had said that your health was not a problem there. Has
                        it ever been a problem? Have you had any serious illnesses?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wonderful. Could you describe your energy levels? Are you
                        an energetic person?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, I think I am. Sometimes I get tired, like anybody else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you would say you're a person with energy. How do you
                        feel your presence made a difference in Papua New Guinea? You were a very
                        important one because you were the first.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I think I was more reassuring to the government of Papua New Guinea on
                    the question of CIA involvement in various matters than some other ambassadors
                    might have been. I think I was more sympathetic to their feeling about it and
                    made more of an effort to reassure them that the CIA was not going to undermine
                    them.</p>
                <p>I think that I was able to demonstrate a friendly interest of our large and
                    important power in a small country, and I think they appreciated that. I think
                    that this would not have been as important possibly to others who might have
                    been in my place.</p>
                <p>I think the fact that I was a woman did make a difference. As I think I have
                    mentioned earlier, I heard not long before I left that the government had
                    started thinking about women more seriously and their role in public life,
                    because the United States sent a woman ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think perhaps because you are a woman you were less
                        threatening to these people? After all, you represented a super, super
                        power.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I think that's possible, because of the fact that I'm not six feet tall,
                    I'm not a domineering personality, and I didn't try to tell them what to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your successor a woman?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came back to the United States, did you have
                        difficulty decompressing, as it were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: (Laughter) Oh, not really. I came back and I was still mildly interested
                    in getting another assignment, but nothing worked out. So I made the decision
                    that I would retire, I would not look for a paying job, I would do volunteer
                    work and would perhaps take a little more time to smell the flowers and enjoy
                    life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you have accepted another mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. I looked for a couple, but none was available.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you describe your activities since you've been
                        retired? You've not only smelled the flowers, but you've planted them,
                        haven't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I've been active in a number of volunteer undertakings which seem to
                    change from time to time. Just before I retired, I was asked if I would
                    participate in a study which was being undertaken under the auspices of the
                    research arm of the Congresswomen's Caucus on Women in the State Department, and
                    I agreed to do that. Originally I was told that they would want me to work in an
                    advisory capacity, and it would not be a heavy burden on my time. As it turned
                    out, it was a heavy burden on my time and I did a great deal of work and a great
                    deal of drafting on it.</p>
                <p>In addition, I was asked to sit on a task force which was being set up under the
                    general auspices of the National Women's Political Caucus to try to ensure that
                    more women would be appointed to high-level offices by the new administration,
                    whatever it might be, that was to come into being after the election of 1979. I
                    agreed to do that, and we had a great many meetings and met with not only our
                    own group, but we met with others. We met with Secretary [Alexander] Haig and
                    met with Secretary [George] Shultz and various other people in the State
                    Department to try to fulfill our mission. I must report, however, that we were
                    very unsuccessful. Perhaps in the long run it did have some impact; I don't
                    know. But initially the Reagan Administration was very resistant to the thought.
                    I shouldn't say “resistant.” It was just uninterested in the idea of having
                    women in high places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That certainly has carried through, hasn't it? Still today
                        there are only two women ambassadors.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. Yes, I am encouraged at seeing Roz Ridgway's appointment and Pat
                    Burns' appointment and a few like that. Jane Coon is getting quite a good job in
                    the Department. But I can remember when there were six and seven career women
                    ambassadors, and we have nothing like that now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that is because the Department takes its tone
                        from the top, which takes its tone from the White House? And do you think it
                        will change under a more pro-women administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, I do. I think you can see that very clearly with regard to the
                    previous administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I just wondered if you thought it was a trend and is going
                        back the other way now, or do you think it's just an aberration because of
                        the Reagan right-wing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I think it is probably an aberration. I don't think that women can
                    forever be kept out of policy-making decisions in the diplomatic side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And yet, you know, reading about women scientists and
                        women in medicine and so forth, they seem to have reached a certain level
                        and then peaked.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I think that's true. I think you find that women do reach a certain
                    level and then there's a ceiling, but I would hope that it would be a plateau
                    and they would then rise from that at a later time.</p>
                <p>As for other things I've been doing, I joined the Woman's National Democratic
                    Club, became active in their International Program Committee. I eventually
                    became chairman of that committee with responsibility for twenty programs a year
                    on international affairs.</p>
                <p>I also participated in the formation of an Alumni Association for graduates of
                    the Senior Seminar, and I was elected to the Board of Directors and became
                    treasurer.</p>
                <p>In addition, I have taken on the job of being the chairman of the Reunion Gift
                    Committee for my college class' 45th reunion. I am on the Board of Directors of
                    the cooperative apartment complex where I live, and I'm on various committees
                    and subcommittees as a result of that responsibility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My word, you must be busy with all these things!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. Some things keep coming along. I took a plot in the community
                    garden and I grow my own vegetables. I bought a dog, which was my retirement
                    present to myself, and the dog, of course, takes a certain amount of my time, as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are you affiliated with any religious group now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I attend services at St. John's Episcopal Church in Georgetown. I'm not
                    active in the church, though.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes and the National Women's Political Caucus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back, can you think of anything you wish you had
                        done differently? Anything that stands out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: (Laughter) Well, nothing that stands out very much. I'm sure there are
                    things that I would have liked to have done differently, but I can't think of
                    them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You can't think of any particular stage when you could say

                <p>OLMSTED: No.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you think is the future of women in the

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I think very definitely they do have a future in the Service, but I
                    expect it will come rather slowly.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: I think something roughly resembling parity. There is always the problem
                    of marriage with women in the Service. If they're married to a man who has a job
                    here, what are they going to do? That will, I think, always work against a 50-50
                    division within the Department of State, but I would expect to see more women
                    steadily promoted to higher levels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think it's possible to have a career in the Foreign
                        Service, given the very definition of the term—foreign service—and be
                        married?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Some women are obviously managing it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: True, but very few.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, very few. I think one has to go into questions: what is the future
                    of marriage? What kind of marriages are you going to see ten, twenty, thirty
                    years hence? Perhaps there will be even greater flexibility than there is now,
                    and perhaps there will be more of these commuter-type marriages. Of course,
                    transportation will make it more possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is true, yes. Can you think of any characteristics
                        women have—we've already discussed some, such as being less threatening—that
                        make women more valuable than men in some situations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I think women are more willing to listen.</p>
                <p>[Begin Tape 3, Side 6]</p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Let me digress to go back to what we were saying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were talking about qualifications or characteristics
                        that women have that men don't, and you had mentioned they listen
                        better.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. That is, perhaps part of the less domineering characteristic that
                    we were talking about. But in dealing with Third World countries, I think that
                    sometimes men, particularly the younger men, go in with the idea that they are
                    to be the big wheel, the big cheese in the country, and try to—well, even throw
                    their weight around a little bit. I think a woman is much less likely to do
                    that.</p>
                <p>

                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, and in addition to that, I think that in some cultures age is much
                    more highly respected than it is here in the United States, and that we are wise
                    to send ambassadors who are fairly well along in years to some countries.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, but it's just broader than that. A person who has reached a certain

                <p>OLMSTED: I think clearly a career in the Foreign Service demands a good deal in
                    the way of fortitude and determination. A young woman should not come in with
                    the idea that it's going to be a lark and that everything will be easy for her,

                    six years, and I'm not really in a position to speak about the current
                    situation. But there are so many more women now at junior levels that I think it

                <p>OLMSTED: When I worked in personnel. In Papua New Guinea, I received the
                    Independence Medal. It was given to people who were in Papua New Guinea at the
                    time of independence. It was not given immediately, but it was given as part of

                <p>OLMSTED: I think being ambassador to Papua New Guinea and having opened the post
                    there, established the American presence.</p>

                        former US ambassador to Bangladesh]. I wondered if you could give me your
                        views on how the women's movement impacted on your career and on your views
                        of yourself. Do you feel it has been a liberating thing for you?</hi>

                        felt that all of this sisterhood and this moving ahead has helped you be
                        more of a person?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: A sense of worth, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the beginning of your career, how much were you
                        affected by the social expectations of sex roles? “Women can only do this,”
                        and “Women aren't doctors; women are nurses,” that type of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I think I was affected by them. I think I pretty much—well, I accepted
                    them up to a certain point. Women were not being Foreign Service officers very
                    much when I made my bid, and the constraints were not so great as to keep me
                    from it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever have the view that Jane did, that you

                        on your dress habits, where you simply had to dress a certain way or wear

                        or were in the habit of wearing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I never wore pantsuits to the office, for example, and nobody ever told
                    me I couldn't. Others did, but I never did.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything that you couldn't do, that you would
                        have liked to do because you were a woman? Any activities in the places you
                        went?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I think I was considerably more cautious about where I went at night
                    than I would have been if I were a man. I was more cautious about going into
                    bars and restaurants and so on, unless I had an escort. I think that may have
                    been particularly true in Vienna, where I served during the four-power
                    occupation, and where there were Russians, sometimes drunk Russian soldiers,
                    around. I'm sure I was more careful there than I would have been otherwise.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I never had a post in a Muslim country. In India, that may have impacted
                    on me once in a while, but I can't remember it as a problem.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: Well, in the case of my family, it was my brother who really made the
                    sacrifice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a very individual matter, but did you ever have
                        any problems with loneliness when you were overseas, living as a single

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Not very much. I'm fairly self-sufficient, and I usually found I could
                    make friends. There are a lot of things I don't mind doing by myself, and when I
                    wanted to do things with somebody, I could usually find some one but not always.
                    Maybe at the beginning, getting to a new post and not knowing anyone, I think
                    there probably were times when I felt a little lonely.</p>

                    way around it—not always, not always, but sometimes. I think a junior officer
                    tends to be shunted off from the more senior people, anyhow.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: I gather it has already.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And will it continue, or do you think it will be
                        solvable?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I would expect, as the Department gets more experience, as the ground
                    rules are more clearly laid down, that it should become more manageable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think they've gone overboard in trying to do
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, I understand so. I've not followed it closely myself. From what I
                    hear—and as I say, I'm not following it closely—but from what I hear, I gather
                    the Department has gone all overboard, at least in certain instances, and that
                    they would have been wiser had they laid down guidelines clearly and firmly and
                    then stuck with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have you also understood that there is resentment welling
                        among the single people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Well, I heard that seven, eight years, ten years ago.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Before the present act, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they already being given the assignments that were
                        left after the tandems were taken care of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: That was the fear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. How do you feel about the open assignment
                        policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: It has both merit and a lack of merit. I think that it is very pleasing
                    to the individual officers who feel that they have a better chance of getting
                    what they want. However, I think that overlooks the fact that a lot of
                    assignments are locked in before they're announced. It also overlooks the fact
                    that it's turned the Foreign Service into one enormous Bureau of Personnel, and
                    a great deal of time is spent on assignments. The number of cables I signed
                    going from young officers back to their counselors about assignments I found
                    just appalling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think it's solved the problem or has it just made
                        it worse?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I don't really know. You see, I left personnel in 1974, and that's
                    eleven years ago. I'm really not in a position to say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What part do you think the terrible growth of terrorism
                        will have on recruitment in the future?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I suspect it won't have as much of an impact on recruitment as it will
                    on assignments. I expect that you will find increasing reluctance to go to
                    certain areas of the world, particularly of married men with young children.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you think of any women that you know of coming up that

                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: If I sat down and thought about this for a little while, I probably
                    would be able to come up with some names, but there again, I've been out of
                    touch for such a long period of time. It's quite possible some of them have gone
                    sour since that time.</p>

                        so forth, didn't achieve it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Oh, yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any number?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Certainly a good many. You see an improvement in the level of positions
                    that women are able to get just about every five years, and those who are five
                    years or a little more than that older than I, lost out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Now, Carol Laise, who is just a little older than I am, is an exception
                    to that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you think of the idea of the proliferation of
                        small embassies in Third World countries? Do you think it would have been
                        better to leave them as they were, under some regional office, or make them
                        ministries? We have 140, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I think we've got about 140. It's at some cost to the United States
                    Government, and in some places there are added considerations of terrorism. I
                    can see the wisdom of either not having or closing small posts at countries that
                    are not very important to us, where there is a terrorist threat. Other than
                    that, I would favor having posts rather than not having them. You can't tell
                    what's going to happen a few years down the road, and you may be very glad about
                    it later that you have a post that's operating and can report back. It might be
                    very helpful to establish at a later period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you think that the higher level of post is considered
                        the better in the eyes of the country? That is to say, an embassy rather
                        than a consulate or ministry?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: We haven't had legations in many years. I don't know that anybody is
                    thinking about establishing anything lower than the embassy at the diplomatic
                    level. I think it would be taken as a bit of a slap, at least in some countries,
                    to establish a consular post as the highest level of representation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it worthwhile to open up all those small embassies in
                        small countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I don't see very many drawbacks. It's not much more expensive to have an
                    embassy than it is to have a consular post, and it is more pleasing to many, if
                    not most, of those countries. So I would favor it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it has the added advantage of giving more Foreign

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, indeed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I think a great deal was expected of it that has not been forthcoming,
                    but I think some of those expectations were quite unrealistic. I think it has
                    served a useful purpose, and I think it will continue to. But as for bringing
                    about world peace and ending strife, that's not in the cards.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you think of the impact of the National Security
                        Council, the head of the National Security Council, on the Department of
                        State? I'm thinking specifically of Kissinger. There are those who think
                        that he did the State Department irreparable damage at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I would agree with that.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: I think that has probably happened in the current administration. I
                    think that [Robert] McFarlane has not been nearly as visible, nor nearly as
                    powerful as many of his predecessors, and I think that's the way the President
                    designed it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I think a great deal depends on the personalities involved and on the
                    general guidelines the President will establish. The President will make it
                    clear that he wants the Secretary of State to be his principal advisor.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, I think it does. I think people begin to wonder, “Why am I working
                    so hard if I'm not getting top-level support and if nothing's going to come from
                    my efforts? Why should I be making these efforts? Nothing will come from
                    it.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel that there is a place for generalists, as well
                        as specialists, in the Service? And do you see that as the role of the

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I've sat through so many debates on this subject.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure you have.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I think the whole trend of things very, very broadly is towards
                    specialization, and I think there has to be specialization in the Foreign
                    Service, but I think the specialist who is unable to broaden out from his own
                    specialty, who is too narrowly focused, is the person for whom there will not be
                    much room at the top.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there any particularly guidelines you would lay down
                        for a young person's education to help them achieve this broad outlook
                        before they start their careers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I don't think what they do initially is as important, perhaps, as what
                    transpires during the service. I think it's very important to take people out of
                    their usual activities and assign them to such courses as the Senior Seminar in
                    the Department. There is resistance to this. I just recently heard that young
                    officers who are being assigned to the mid-career course are complaining over
                    having to be out of the mainstream for that long a period of time. Well, I think
                    it's very important that they should be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the years off for university that they're often
                        giving in mid-career?</hi>

                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes, I think that's good, although many of these are for area
                    specialization, some of which tends to be rather narrowly focused.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. And I think that the Department often overlooks people who are
                    working closely with regulations and law, consular officers and administrative
                    officers. I think the Department overlooks the need for broadening these people
                    and for giving them this kind of training, university training, Senior Seminar
                    and so on.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: When was the last time I took a course at FSI? (Laughter) I guess it was
                    about twenty years ago. I really don't know.</p>
                <p>We haven't really talked about women in the consular field. I do think that is
                    one of the barriers to the increased role that women will play in the Foreign
                    Service. I think there has been—either a witting or an unwitting—concentration
                    of women in the consular cone and, to a lesser degree, in the administrative
                    cone. I think the opportunities are fewer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this because it is perceived that they will not then
                        reach the level where there is going to be a problem with them later? I
                        mean, if they've never had political work and they've never had economic
                        work, obviously as they go up the ladder there's not going to be any slot
                        for them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Yes. I think there is a feeling among some people in the Foreign
                    Service, some men, that if we have to have women, let them do their consular
                    work and housekeeping.</p>

                <p>OLMSTED: Well, it's not dealing with the prime minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in other words, this isn't a positive thing. It isn't

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Whether that view still prevails, I don't know, but I know that the
                    consular cone has been very heavily staffed by women.</p>

                        to come into the Service, is there any reason for them to study classics and
                        philosophy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I've known some very good Foreign Service officers who came into the
                    Service after a background in philosophy or in the classics, and obviously it's
                    no barrier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think it would help to broaden perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: It would help to broaden perspective, but on the other hand, when you're
                    looking for a new assignment and they ask you, “What did you major in?” and you
                    say, “philosophy,” it doesn't help to get an assignment as a political officer
                    or consular officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Better to say, “history,” and “languages”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Or “political science” or “economics.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those four?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I would say political science and economics are the two most desired
                    vocational training fields for Foreign Service officers. Whether they make the
                    best officers or not is something that you can debate about for a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a good point. Do you have any reflections you'd
                        like to share as we wind this up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I think I've talked myself out pretty well.</p>

                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: I'll be interested in seeing how it all comes out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to thank you very much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>OLMSTED: Thank you.</p>
