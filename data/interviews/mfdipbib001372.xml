                <p>Copyright 2006 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The interview is with Hariadene Johnson who served in
                        USAID for many years. Give us a sketch of your career in Foreign
                        Assistance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I joined the USAID in September of 1967 as a Management Intern, a
                    category which they no longer have, but essentially it was a Junior Officer
                    Intern System. I retired in September of 1994 after 30 years with the Federal
                    government. All of that in USAID; most of the 20 years in the Africa Bureau; and
                    the other ten, more or less roaming around the Agency. For awhile there I
                    specialized in islands. I worked in the Caribbean and the South Pacific Islands;
                    then I did some work with the Asia Bureau; then the last four years I was with
                    the Agency, I was with the Newly Independent States, Russia and Eastern Europe;
                    and the final six months with the Clinton transition team which was headed by
                    Golar Butcher (former AA for the Africa Bureau), who was a long term friend and
                    former boss. She asked me to work on the transition, and I was more than happy
                    too. That's somewhat of a sketch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to where you grew up and where you went to
                        school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I was born in Waco, Texas in 1942. I grew up there, stayed there really
                    until I was 18 and went away to college. At that time, Waco was very much of a
                    small, southern town. It was closer to East Texas than West Texas, but
                    technically it is Central Texas. It was primarily a marketing town to the middle
                    of the cotton and sorghum growing area. It is located half way between Dallas
                    and Houston. There's a fine University in Waco, called Bailer University, which
                    I refused to go to, and so I went to Austin to the University of Texas in Austin
                    and got my graduate degree there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you major in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I majored in something called Plan Two.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: For Plan One you declared a major and had so many hours required in so
                    many subjects. Plan Two was an attempt to set up a small college within the
                    confines of a large University so that you had a core group of subjects, called
                    Plan Two courses, which basically were liberal arts, and then you could take the
                    rest of your credits anywhere you wanted to. Essentially, all of your courses
                    were taught by full professors, even as a Freshman. They tended to be 25 to 30
                    people as opposed to the 300 people who were in the normal big sessions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have had some special qualifications to get into
                        that kind of a program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Essentially, it was honors, a honors graduate from High School and then
                    application scores on the SAT exams, things like that in terms of acceptance
                    into the University. First, you were accepted into the University of Texas and
                    then you were accepted as a Plan Two Major within that overall curriculum.
                    Essentially, it wound up with letting you take graduate courses at the Sophomore
                    level. I went Freshman year and went to Summer School and then my Sophomore year
                    they started letting me take graduate courses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any particular theme to the core of the Plan Two
                        program that you took?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Liberal arts. They had your basic courses. Essentially, you would have
                    been required to take, English, History, Mathematics, Sciences. You just took
                    Plan Two sections, so that instead of being in the larger classes you were in
                    the smaller classes. Starting your Junior year, they more or less ran on a
                    tutorial basis, like a graduate seminar. I ended up with a triple major in
                    philosophy, government and sociology (which also qualified for Phi Beta Kappa)
                    and graduated with honors. Considering that every course I took was a honor
                    course, I am very proud of my accomplishment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, of course. Was there anything in that that was
                        related to foreign affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: I took a lot of international courses in terms of Russian government,
                    Latin American governments, since Texas is so close to Latin America. But, more
                    than anything, it was just a straight Liberal Arts generalized type of program.
                    My parents, of course, wanted me to get a teaching certificate so that I would
                    have something to fall back on and I refused. The choice was basically, I
                    decided that I didn't want to go to law school, I wanted to go to graduate
                    school and be a college professor. Of all the things that I had studied, I
                    enjoyed government the most, comparative government more than International
                    Relations or U.S. diplomatic history. I went to the University of Wisconsin at
                    Madison and got a Masters Degree there and was working on my Doctorate there in
                    Political Science, International Affairs, Comparative Government. It was right
                    at the height, well when I was at the University of Texas, it was pretty much at
                    the height of the Civil Rights movement. When I was at the University of
                    Wisconsin, it was at the anti war, anti Vietnam War stage. I got very depressed,
                    essentially that what I was doing, I was going to the Library and looking up
                    articles so I could write papers, which I was very lucky to get published, and
                    then somebody else would go to the Library and look at what I had written in
                    order to publish something else. It seemed like a very closed circle in the
                    context of the Vietnam War where there was so much activism and so much feeling
                    that you can change the world. And, coming out of the Civil Rights Movement, so
                    much feeling that you know, being an activist and that you could change the face
                    of the U.S. I really got to where I felt staying in college and looking towards
                    being a college professor was simply too passive and that I wanted to get more
                    involved in what was happening in the world.Q: Did you write a Master's
                    thesis?</p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I wrote a Master's thesis and it was a Comparison of the Role of the
                    Military in nation building in Burma and in Indonesia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did you pick those countries? What led you into
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Fascination of differences. It was fun to study the United States and
                    see how many problems we'd managed to overcome. But, for me it was more
                    interesting to look then at other countries and see what was happening in those
                    countries, especially in the developing world, and compare what they went
                    through with the U.S. as a revolutionary “young nation” with the newly emerging
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there some course or professor that caught your
                        interest that got you on to that track, rather than something else?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Probably the most important professor was a man by the name of Henry
                    Hart. His area was South Asia. He not only was the one that I found his courses
                    fascinating. I used him really as my advisor for a lot of the University work.
                    He was also the one I talked to about leaving and going to work for the
                    government. I remember this one discussion I had with him that I hated to quit.
                    But, I felt I should go ahead and stay at Wisconsin long enough to get my
                    Doctorate. Otherwise, I just felt I would be a quitter. He looked at me and he
                    said, “But basically, you already have quit.” And, he was right, I had. I got a
                    fellowship with residence as a residence hall advisor. They paid tuition and
                    books and then gave you free room and board. I moved up from there to head
                    resident and was in charge of an eighteen hundred student dorm. There were 900
                    women and 900 men. The last year that I was at school, I sort of took one class
                    which technically qualified me as a student and spent most of my energy in the
                    dorm and in working with a couple of the different groups around town, the
                    international students and things like that. Dr. Hart was right.Q: So, you did
                    work with international students, I guess?</p>
                <p>JOHNSON: We worked with a lot of international students at the University of
                    Texas which really started me off. My primary area of activity was with the
                    international student house and then with something called a model U.N. where we
                    sponsored a model United Nations every year on the Texas campus. I worked in
                    that and was the chairman of the group that planned it and then was also the
                    Secretary General of the model U.N. my senior year where I helped run the whole
                    thing. I came to a model U.N. program up here in Washington, D.C. sponsored by
                    American University, Georgetown, and Catholic University, and Howard,
                    altogether.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did that model U.N. do? What was it supposed to
                        be?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: The Model U.N. was an attempt. It was sponsored by the American
                    Association for the United Nations and probably in the last resort, it was an
                    attempt to brainwash young people. It was for the U.N.'s good. It's a good
                    thing. In Texas especially, where at that time you had billboards on the
                    highway, saying get the U.S. out of the U.N. Just a strong right wing feeling
                    that the United Nations was an evil, corrupt and ineffective organization. So,
                    the model U.N. essentially had different groups signing up to represent
                    countries. For example, the German Club, sponsored by the people who are
                    majoring in German would sign up for Austria. Actually, we had delegations from
                    Mexico to come as a representative of Mexico and then we'd get the Tridelts
                    (fraternity) to represent Great Britain or France and the other universities.
                    You can do it any scale you want to. Our particular scale was that we cover all
                    of Texas and Oklahoma and Mexico. So, we had pretty wide ranging representation.
                    Part of our job, the sponsors of it were then to find people who would provide
                    housing and/or scholarships to cover meals and things like that. The last year
                    when I was the Secretary General, we wound up with two different groups coming
                    from Mexico; the Mexican Universities were very politicized. Much more so than
                    the U.S. was at that time in '64. Probably much more than U.S. campuses ever
                    were. So, we had two different feuding groups from the University of Mexico,
                    both of whom showed up in Austin and said, “We're here as a representative of
                    the University of Mexico.” We got the Chancellor of the University and the Dean
                    of students, and everybody got involved about why are we causing all of this
                    trouble. The main sponsor, actually the one that got me more interested in
                    working with international students at the University of Texas was the (YMCA
                    ed?) YWCA, which was an off campus set up. At that point, I remember in my
                    Freshman year, they were bombed. Somebody set off a bomb. It didn't hurt
                    anybody, it did some structural damage. I remember in my Freshman year thinking,
                    what are they doing over there that they are bombing them. By the time I was a
                    Senior I was really active in Y programs and I used the thought, what kind of
                    people bomb other people. Just a great deal I think, in terms of opening it up
                    to possibilities and other avenues. Because it was an off campus organization it
                    was desegregated from the very beginning with a lot of work from the Civil
                    Rights movement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's an interesting beginning. From there and
                        after your degree work, what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It was fairly odd. A British friend of mine wanted to take the Federal
                    Entrance Exam and the Management Intern Exam and didn't want to take it alone.
                    She talked me into going and taking the exam just for somebody to keep her
                    company. A French friend went and took it just in order to see how well his
                    scores would come out. It was pure competition. So, the three of us traveled off
                    to take this exam and all three of us did very well and were offered Management
                    Internships and came to Washington to interview with different agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was an exam where you took a written test and then
                        you had an interview process?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: The basic Civil Service Entrance Exam was a written test. Then they
                    compared your scores on a written exam and you did a follow-up, a special exam
                    for the Management Intern Program and submitted your grades, your transcript and
                    did oral interviews. Then, based upon their rating of you, your name went on a
                    Management Intern Eligibility list, I guess is the way to put it. You were then
                    eligible to talk to any government agency you wanted to and be hired as a
                    Management Intern, if they were interested. Essentially, all the exam process
                    did was say that you were eligible if somebody wanted to hire you, at the
                    incredible grade of a GS-7, which was more than if you just did the Federal
                    Service exam, then you started as a GS-5. Then, I wrote to USAID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why USAID? How did you know about USAID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: A professor, Dr. Ronderedon. He was one of the professors at Wisconsin
                    with whom I took courses on Asia. He had a contract with USAID to do some work
                    in Thailand and he used his graduate seminars to write up proposals. I remember
                    I wrote something on transportation in Northern Thailand and the way it could
                    contribute to nation building. Anyway, USAID seemed like, you know again, I was
                    coming out of this feeling of wanting to do something. And, just being in
                    academia was too passive, too irrelevant. So, I wrote USAID. The very first
                    official letter I had back from USAID was from Henrietta Moore, who was a
                    coordinator of the intern program, who informed me that USAID was in a hiring
                    freeze and couldn't hire anybody and so therefore, thanked me for my interest,
                    but said go away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: This was in the Spring of 1967. So, I came out and interviewed with the
                    Defense Intelligence Agency and HEW at that point, Health, Education and Welfare
                    before they split it up, just because I was curious. I mainly wanted to see the
                    State Department. I called and set up an appointment with USAID. It turned out
                    that USAID personnel was not in the State Department, they were over on East
                    Street or something. So, I never did get to see the State Department, but
                    Henrietta, when I went in and said hello, she said, “Well, as long as you're
                    here, why don't you interview?” And, she sent me on a round of interviews with
                    various parts of USAID. Like, Congressional Liaison, and the only one I remember
                    was in the Africa Bureau. At that time, the different regional Bureaus had their
                    own personnel authority so that you could interview with the Personnel Office
                    for Africa, as opposed to the overall Central Personnel Office. So, the Africa
                    Bureau offered me a Management Intern job, and I accepted and started work in
                    September of 1967.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Interesting. You went right in to it. What was your first
                        assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Well, the first shock was I found out that when you start work with the
                    government you got paid on a two week delayed basis and it would be four weeks
                    before I got a paycheck. My second shock about then was, they failed to pass the
                    USAID continuing resolution. They told all of us that we wouldn't be paid for a
                    while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Other than that, I enjoyed it very much. So, I started in the Africa
                    Bureau Personnel Office working with Fred Hann, and then did a rotation over in
                    the Office of International Training; then a rotation on the Central West Africa
                    desk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were in a rotation mode?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Essentially what they did under the intern program was they offered you
                    an opportunity to take two to three months rotation in different offices. One,
                    both to give you exposure to the Agency and also to give the Agency a chance to
                    assess you and see what your talents were. In that particular year, 1967, we
                    also had a series of seminars that they set up for the interns and the Office of
                    Personnel Management ran seminars for interns from throughout the government. It
                    was really a good program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Agency at that early
                        stage?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Well, I found it very confusing. I would have to say, I don't know. You
                    have to understand I came straight from Graduate School and both at the
                    University of Texas and at the University of Wisconsin were very much activist
                    campus when I was there. They were by no means the first of the line when the
                    police started clubbing people or anything like that. But, it was a heavy period
                    to be on campus and coming into Washington and the government, it just felt
                    very, very much like a very small cog in a very large machine. That whole first
                    year, '67-68, the Personnel people kept telling us to take a permanent job. If
                    we rotated around the Agency, if we were offered a permanent job to take it
                    immediately and not do the full year for the training program, because personnel
                    spots were very tight and that there was no guarantee that they would have jobs
                    for us at the end of the 12 month training period. There was an intern class
                    that started in July of about 25 people and an intern class that started in
                    September of about 15 people. Of that 35 or 40 people, I would say all but five
                    had permanent positions that they found during the rotation period. There were
                    five of us that were still on the books as IDI's (International Development
                    Intern) when the rough of '68 hit, which was a major reduction and force
                    throughout the Agency. It wiped out three years of intern classes essentially.
                    There were five of us that were saved, because we were non competitive, because
                    we were still considered in training roles. They ended up saving some of the
                    others. Essentially, they downgraded people who were GS-11 or 12, they
                    downgraded them to a seven and within six months they found ways to promote them
                    back up. So, you didn't lose your entire generational leadership, but it made a
                    major dent in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a traumatic time then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Very much so, especially if you're essentially fresh hire. You know,
                    last in and first to go kind of feeling. Also, a feeling that you looked around
                    the Agency and you were seeing so many people who were essentially, through no
                    fault of their own, just being totally disrupted. Sort of a strong feeling of,
                    do you want to stay in this for a career. Is it something that you really see as
                    being a 20 year career and essentially, the answer was no. I just said, it
                    probably wouldn't work for a career, but I would stay as long as I enjoyed it
                    and when I ceased to enjoy it, then I would go back to school. That was always
                    my escape hatch. I figured that if you say you left your job to go back to
                    school it looks ok So, that was always my escape hatch, that I would go to
                    school. It turned out that USAID was fascinating. You work with an
                    extraordinarily intelligent group of people. Both the people who were there on a
                    permanent basis and the ones that you wind up hiring from the outside, from the
                    Universities or later from private contractors. And, an extremely diverse group
                    of people. I found it fascinating. I found the whole initial interest in how
                    other countries differ from the U.S. and for the developing world, especially
                    Africa in 1960s. It was like one country after another was becoming independent,
                    and each one tried to chart their own way through those pre-independence days
                    blues. It just seemed an extraordinarily interesting period to work with and to
                    watch.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Africa came to independence much later than Latin America or Asia. It always
                    seemed that we had fewer resources to play with than they did in other Bureaus.
                    And, the point of that is, the bureaucratic in fighting about, do we get more
                    than money But, part of it was that, I think in reality, anything that's old and
                    established keeps getting its resources. You know, you get what you got before
                    plus ten percent if the Agency can do it. If you're new, then you've got to
                    elbow your way into the system. It doesn't happen overnight. You have to sort of
                    inch it out. The African Bureau, because of the massive explosion to
                    independence, e.g. in 1962 there were two independent countries; and by 1968
                    there were 38; and by 1975 there were 40. I mean, you just see countries,
                    becoming independent every single day. Every time an African country became
                    independent, the U.S. opened an Embassy, set up an USAID's scholarship program.
                    But, then the African Bureau had to become extremely creative in terms of how do
                    you manage a program that's over so many countries; so much difference; and use
                    your resources, mainly your staff resources as well as you can. So, I think the
                    African Bureau experimented with more different forms of organizational
                    management than most of the rest of the Agency. Much of what we did in Africa
                    later was adopted elsewhere with the other Bureaus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give me an example? We won't spend a lot on
                        that, but what are some?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: We set up the regional concept. which started out with an organization
                    called RUA, which was Regional USAID in Washington, where you had an office in
                    Washington that had every delegation of authority that a Mission overseas would
                    have, up to having a director, a training officer, an executive officer, and a
                    controller. It ran as a completely delegated mission for the countries assigned
                    to that program. This was in '65, '66, '67. It was later duplicated almost
                    exactly by the Eastern European Program in 92 and '93, where they ran an USAID
                    Mission in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reason for doing that, do you remember, for
                        the Africa program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: The African organization was due to the desire for efficiency through
                    concentration. You were running programs in 15 different countries and you
                    simply didn't have the staff resources or the money to have a fully fledged
                    mission in each country. But, you could have a mission in Washington that was
                    running projects in those countries, but essentially then tried to handle all
                    the project support from Washington. It was very much what happened in Eastern
                    Europe, along with the security concern of being unwilling, I think to put that
                    many Americans out in the field. But, the idea was that you could run programs
                    from Washington. I think in the Regional USAID process, well both in the
                    Regional USAID process and later in the Eastern Europe process is financially
                    possible, it is a fact, that you can run a program out of Washington. The
                    problem with it is that every system in the Agency is really set up to run
                    differently and that you wind up with complicating your management tasks by a
                    factor of eight to ten times. You make it harder for yourself than you otherwise
                    would, simply because what you're doing isn't the way the system is supposed to
                    work. Secondly, I think you wind up with a previous position to do projects,
                    individually complete, self-contained projects. Simply because, you don't have
                    people in country who can do a day-to-day dialogue with the host government that
                    helps change a project into something broader. And, that's why I said, I think
                    in a lot of cases, USAID wound up finding that doing the single intervention
                    simply didn't have the mass or the weight to make all of the other related
                    changes that needed to be made. You wound up... (I feel like I'm repeating a
                    conversation I had with my State Department colleagues.) You want the
                    opportunities where you could take a picture in front of a building we built, or
                    you can cut a ribbon in front of the new school that had reopened. Those
                    projects didn't make any lasting change in the educational system. I think in
                    many ways, USAID people tend to be idealistic. They tend to think they can make
                    a lasting change in the educational system. Many of our State Department
                    colleagues don't. They figure the lasting ain't going to happen anyway, and so
                    go for the full opportunity of the moment. Go for the short term impact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The impact for the moment establishes our relationship.
                        That's interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: As the program expanded, we began to get more and more funds and tried
                    to run bigger programs. You couldn't do it out of Washington. You needed people
                    locally. And, the first step in doing that was to establish essentially, what we
                    called the sub-units of the established missions, which then would be
                    responsible for the program, like there was one in the sub-unit in Senegal. It
                    was also responsible for Mali, Mauritania; the sub-unit in Cameroon was
                    responsible for Chad, Central Africa Republic, and Gabon. But, the full
                    delegations of authorities were still held by Washington Then as the Sahel broke
                    loose, the sails are out and attention focused on what was going on in that
                    area</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the area that the Regional Office in Washington
                        (RUA) covered, isn't that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Essentially, the office in Washington, and I don't know if it was
                    deliberate or not, but in effect it was the former francophone colonies. There
                    were some 15, 16 former francophone colonies scattered from the west coast of
                    Africa through central Africa and then down almost into southern Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a result of the Korry report; do you remember
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Well, the Korry report would go...yeah, I know the Korry report. What
                    happened with the Korry report was like I was saying in the '60s we had a new
                    country coming on the scene every week. We wound up with Embassies and USAID
                    Missions in every single country in Africa. The feeling was very strong that we
                    couldn't do that, that we had to cut back on the number of countries. And,
                    Ambassador Korry wrote a report in which he essentially argued that you should
                    have your core countries and then you could have these other countries that you
                    provided some assistance to, but you didn't really make a major effort. I think
                    at the time we had eight countries that were considered core countries. You had,
                    Tanzania, Kenya, Ethiopia, Sudan on the east coast; and then you had Nigeria,
                    Liberia and Ghana. Zaire was not one of the original Korry countries, because
                    when I was Assistant Desk Officer on Congo, we had an exercise where we, well
                    back up a second...</p>
                <p>As part of the Korry report, you could do bilateral programs in these core
                    countries, and then you did regional projects everywhere else. Regional became
                    almost a question of how many angels can one fit on the head of a pin. They
                    wound up with the definition that regional was working through a regional
                    institution; regional was working with a project that benefited more than one
                    country that it crossed a national border; or regional was something that had
                    regional impact, even though it might be totally confined within one country. At
                    one time when I was Assistant Desk Officer for Ghana and Liberia, they had an
                    exercise of moving Zaire from the Regional list to the bilateral list. The
                    request for approval went up to the Administrator and all the arguments were
                    laid out as to why we should have a direct bilateral relationship with
                    Zaire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, this Regional Mission in Washington was a part of a
                        regional approach, was it not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Right. It was the, well yes, I think the African Bureau was fairly
                    creative. You could have said regional projects are only going to be programs
                    through regional organizations and we will work with Paris and London to work
                    with these countries, and you need a Mission in Washington to do that. The idea,
                    I think ...(without having been there for the original arguments,) essentially
                    the idea of a Regional Office in Washington was to bend the rules as far as you
                    could. But, most people in Africa felt that it was a major foreign policy
                    mistake to cut back to so few countries and essentially stop being active in
                    others, and that some other countries that we were ceasing to be active in were
                    very important in terms of what happened on the continent of Africa and also in
                    terms of working with the other donors. You couldn't just have some being just
                    American clients and others being the French clients. That was the wrong way to
                    carve up Africa. So, the Washington Mission was in order to give somebody in
                    Washington the same authority they would have had as in the field and then let
                    them try and push the envelope as far as they could with the people in PPC
                    (USAID Program and Policy Coordination Bureau) or the State Department.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: First regular assignment was on the Ghana desk, working initially with a
                    man on detail from State Department. His name I think was Smith and then later
                    with David Shear and Steve Christmas.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in 1968?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: '68-69. I stayed on the Ghana desk. Well, first of all when I was
                    working, it was Ghana-Sierra Leone Desk; then it was the Ghana, Liberia, Sierra
                    Leone Desk.. It sort of kept getting reorganized. With the core activities, for
                    me anyway, were on Ghana, where I worked on the Ghana program. That was
                    primarily working on the Commodity Import Program and Program Loan, which in an
                    interesting sort of way was a precursor to the policy reform issues that the
                    Agency as a whole discovered in the late '70s '80s.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: This is a booby trap, since I was working with you as the Mission
                    Director in Ghana.</p>
                <p>

                <p>JOHNSON: I don't know, I think originally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I didn't get there until 1970 anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: But you were my boss in Washington. Do you realize that of my 30 years
                    with USAID and you were my boss for 20.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. I'll be darn. Well, let's forget that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It's all your fault. I started working on the Ghana desk and it was an
                    extremely complex program in terms of what USAID did in those days. You had a
                    combination of capital assistance and the big Volta Dam project, combined with
                    private enterprise, Kaiser Aluminum Company, which was working with the power
                    that the dam provided; a technical assistance program, providing assistance in a
                    broad range of areas; and a policy-oriented commodity import program and PL480
                    program. We were trying to get the country to put together an economic policy
                    package. At the time of independence, Ghana was very much under Nkrumah, who
                    really espoused Pan Africanism and wound up wasting a lot of the resources that
                    Ghana had at independence through various and assorted attempts to push Pan
                    Africanism. By the time I started working on Ghana, it was totally broke,
                    heavily in debt internationally and had gone through a military police coup,
                    which at that time was unique. At that point the Ghana program was extremely
                    complex. You were working with probably one of the better educated, trained
                    people. In terms of most of the African countries, they did have a better formed
                    base of educated leadership. Essentially, looking back on it, I think most of
                    what we did was probably well intentioned, but somehow we weren't really making
                    permanent changes. The Police Military group was followed by a national
                    election, which was followed by a military coup. So, the politics of it were
                    undermining most of what we did. As a general theme, I would say that what
                    started in 1967 was a strong feeling conditioned in large part by the war in
                    Vietnam, not interfering in internal affairs and that we were there to help
                    them.Q: You mean the Vietnam War?</p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Because of the Vietnam War when we were so strongly involved, you had a
                    mind set throughout the rest of the Agency of not interfering and not
                    intervening. I think in Africa you had that mind set. I think for people who
                    worked in the Middle East countries or people who worked in Asia, they were more
                    conditioned to U.S. influencing local politics. I think in Africa that we felt
                    very much that we were there to help other nations make choices, but not to
                    dictate what choices they took. And, that as a result, we wound up not really
                    being well informed, I think about the politics of what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you work on specifically in relation to the Ghana
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: We had just started the Program Loan in Ghana, which was financing for a
                    commodity import program (CIP) where the funds were released based upon
                    agreement to certain policy conditions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember what the policy issues were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Most of the policy issues had to do with trying to come up with a
                    exchange rate policy whereby the Ghanaian cedi would not be artificially
                    maintained; you would not have capital controls. The country was afraid if they
                    didn't have controls on the flight of capital you would have capital flight
                    where all funds in the country would go elsewhere. The Ghanaian airline, at that
                    point, wouldn't take cedis. If you wanted to buy a Coke on Ghana airways, you
                    had to come up with dollars or pounds or something else. They wouldn't take the
                    national currency. Most of the big policy issues were related to the foreign
                    exchange.</p>
                <p>The CIP itself financed certain groups of commodities. There was an attempt to
                    finance commodities, which then made some contribution to development within a
                    country, which was walking a very thin line between the kinds of currency
                    controls that the government itself wanted and an open, more liberal type of
                    import regime, which is what we were promoting. We were concerned about how they
                    spent our money; we got very picky and we were very tight in controlling what
                    they could and couldn't do. For example, we also had a PL480 program there.
                    Essentially, it was a food aid program, but it financed manufactured or
                    semi-manufactured commodities, which were not essentially food. We financed
                    tallow, which went into some of the industrial factories there; we financed grey
                    cloth, which is a processed and semi-bleached textile, just cotton. Rolls and
                    rolls of cotton as opposed to financing wheat, or corn, or vegetable oil [ed].
                    Even the vegetable oil, that we financed, went into industry as opposed to food
                    aid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that unusual?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It was very unusual for the PL480 program at the time, and even later. I
                    think over time it probably went more and more toward being straight food aid
                    and being tied to some type of perceived shortage in agricultural production.
                    Ghana was very much tied into the CIP where the two, both in terms of policy
                    negotiations and in terms of commodities tried to have an impact upon the
                    economy. You ran into really funny things in trying to provide the cotton for
                    the textile factories in Ghana where the U.S. Department of Agriculture would
                    absolutely go bananas over how much cotton cloth was being used. They could not
                    believe that a country of X million population use, X plus Y yards of cloth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The local consumption.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: The local consumption. They were convinced that somehow they were
                    black-marketing it and shipping it across the border to other countries. And,
                    just to get into this extraordinary disagreements with the Department of
                    Agriculture, because they had absolutely no knowledge of Africa and had you
                    know, a blouse, coats, one and one-half yards of cotton, as opposed to a
                    Ghanaian blouse might take six yards of cotton, because of the way it was
                    constructed and sewn and overlapped and etc. etc. etc. Also, we were trying to
                    provide textile machinery under the CIP, which could be used in the textile
                    factories. I found out the extent of the various U.S. agricultural lobby
                    interests over in the Department of Agriculture was one poor man in one little
                    office in the back of the building who worried about exporting textile machinery
                    and tried to promote it and thought it was a great idea and it was something
                    that we should do more of. There were 99 other people (e.g. the Department of
                    Commerce, ed) who were devoted to not increasing the competition that U.S. cloth
                    faced, and so they didn't want us to help in the manufacturing and export of
                    cloth. Later, in addition to the free trade and the NAFTA free trade zone fights
                    of the '90s, we were exporting jobs to Mexico. In this case, the textile
                    lobbyists felt very strongly that they wanted the textile production to be in
                    the United States and then we could sell finished commodities to Ghana. We're
                    talking about the difference between theoretical, logical demand in Ghana for
                    U.S. manufactured cloth and effective demand, which was zero, the foreign
                    exchange to pay for it was coming from the U.S. anyway. So, we were not cutting
                    into American sales.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they resolve the issue or did they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yeah. We managed to get grey cloth under the PL480 program, as opposed
                    to food, but we never managed to get textile machinery into the commodity import
                    program [actually we did but the equipment had to be segregated in the
                    production line for local production only! ed]. So, it was sort of half and
                    half. For me, at that time, it was like theory logically knowing from academic
                    studies, you know, and the different lobby groups with different positions.
                    Knowing that in theory and seeing it in practice were two different things. As
                    you walk into it and you see exactly what that means, as public policy is
                    formulated and the impact, you know, long established lobbying groups and long
                    established positions. The absolute total ( disconnect, ed.).</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was this textile program, as an example, helpful, or
                        was it, to Ghana's development?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Quite honestly I'm thinking I never really went back and looked to see
                    what was the overall long term impact. I think that the time and theory was very
                    much that it represented a low technology type of operation that could be run in
                    an LDC (less developed country), where you had a labor force that could be
                    trained for the tasks were required. Therefore, utilize a local product, i.e.
                    Ghanaian cotton, provided employment or jobs for Ghanaians. In the long run,
                    hopefully we provide export earnings as the cloth that was dyed and printed in
                    Ghana could be exported to surrounding African nations. I don't know if any of
                    that ever happened or not.</p>
                <p>I ran into something similar years later when working in Uganda. I remember
                    trying to explain it to a new Assistant Administrator that the analysis of a
                    sugar factory for Uganda was based on the assumption that you could produce
                    locally enough to replace all of the sugar that was being imported from Kenya,
                    plus you could export it to Rwanda, Burundi, and Eastern Zaire which were closer
                    markets for Uganda than Kenya. No one really ever did and this was like in the
                    '80s and the Agency still didn't have a way to do it. The Rwanda mission was
                    also planning a sugar factory, based on that they could then market the sugar to
                    Burundi and Uganda. And, in the meantime, the Kenyans were trying desperately to
                    help stabilize their economy which was dependent upon sugar exports for 30
                    percent of the country's earnings. Even when we got into looking more at private
                    sector investments as opposed to government direct investments on the assumption
                    that the private sector with realistic marketing analysis, somehow we always
                    emphasized production, rather than marketing. Anyway, that was sort of 20 years
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was an interesting perspective. Were there other
                        things you worked on on the Ghana desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I spent six months trying to convince myself that there was a difference
                    between obligations and expenditures. So, seeing all the things that Junior Desk
                    Officers do such as technical assistance and PIO/Ts (Project Implementation
                    Orders) for technical assistance and general sort of mission support. The
                    mission would send a cable and then you'd try and find somebody in the Agency
                    who knew something about what they were talking about. The CIP was fun, because
                    it was not something that Desk Officers usually did.Q: Did you write a program
                    document for a CIP?</p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The very first time overseas, actually. I did a couple of, I don't know
                    if you'd say I wrote them. What I did, I took them around Washington trying to
                    get them approved and negotiated their acceptance.</p>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: I think they were pretty standard. I don't really remember very much
                    that was different about them. The first time that I ever went overseas in my
                    entire life was to Ghana to work on the annual budget submission and do the
                    commodity import portion annex of that submission; it was an absolutely, totally
                    incredible experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Almost every level. I guess my first feeling was, I get off the airplane
                    and there were all these Coca Cola advertising billboards on the run from the
                    airport into the town. It was like going to any American city. It was the lack
                    of difference, you know struggling to see the difference. And, later when I had
                    a chance to be more, I don't know if sensitize is the right word, I saw a
                    broader picture than when I was sitting in a taxi and watching the billboards go
                    past. When I had an actual chance, I sat down and talked to Ghanaians. It was
                    very different, a very different society; very different perspective on
                    everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What difference did you observe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: All over town as you drove around, there were these half completed
                    buildings where someone would put in a floor or they'd get up to the bottom of
                    the window sills and then they'd just be stopped for months at a time. As a
                    negative construction, it certainly caused total confusion. But, I talked to
                    some Ghanaians about why was that the way people did it. Was it inability to get
                    mortgage funds so that you couldn't do the whole thing at once or was there a
                    reason in back of it. They explained to me that it was very much the requirement
                    in Ghana that if you did well that you helped out your family and they had an
                    extended definition of who your family was. Going back two or three generations
                    and coming forward with all the cousins and in-laws and everybody else. And,
                    that in effect if you had a good job and you were in a good position and you
                    wanted to build your own house, you couldn't save your money, because then
                    people would know that you had money and they would want you to finance sister
                    Tom's brother's second cousin's child's education fees. So, they'd put it into a
                    house, but it was like they only had ten dollars, so they'd do ten dollars worth
                    of work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Otherwise, a savings account.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: It was a savings account where your relatives could come live with you
                    eventually, I guess after you got the house built. But, there was much a strong
                    impact that family relations had on every decision you made. In terms of what
                    job you took, how you spent your money, where you lived, how you lived. One
                    other thing I remember: I was at the hotel and I was supposed to go out for
                    dinner with a Ghanaian Police Lieutenant who was the first female Police
                    Lieutenant that they'd ever had, period. So, she and I were going to go out for
                    dinner and she came by the hotel and I was sitting in the lobby waiting for her
                    to show up and there was this total complete chaos, because two of the guys, two
                    of the doormen at the hotel, found a guy trying to steal tires out of the
                    parking lot. They cornered him and they brought him into the lobby and had the
                    counter man call the police and the police were going to come pick him up. This
                    all sounds very normal, except for the fact that there were at least a hundred
                    people who were attracted by the fact that they had arrested this guy and who
                    started beating him up. Your two hotel people were doing their best to keep the
                    guy from getting killed and everybody else was screaming and shouting and
                    punching and clubbing. It was just an incredible mob scene. And, this Police
                    Lieutenant showed up and explained to me that</p>
                <p>As Desk Officer I was were very much into Ghana's debt rescheduling and working
                    with the World Bank and the IMF on rescheduling a massive foreign debt.Q: How
                    did you find that?</p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Debt rescheduling is very much of a challenge. I had an economic
                    background and absolutely nothing in the banking finance area. Actually, more a
                    trade background. I got into the midst of all the nitty gritty of debt
                    rescheduling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job? What were you doing on it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Essentially, I was the Assistant Desk Officer at the time. I think they
                    gave it to me because nobody else had ever done it either. So, since nobody had
                    any expertise in it, they said, “Okay, see what you can do with it.” Then I
                    developed expertise and became the rescheduling genius. I remember with a great
                    deal of gratitude some people at the Export/Import Bank. They spent hours trying
                    to explain to me a hundred and eighty day credits and how that differed from
                    other things and interest rates. Everything about international banking that
                    they knew from the export-import side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Export/Import Bank had loans, which were subject to
                        rescheduling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yeah, they had exposure, which we wanted to be rescheduled. We, of
                    course had the big Volta Dam loans that would have to be rescheduled and the
                    Kaiser Aluminum Company was in there, just a whole ring of characters besides
                    just USAID.I think it was unusual for a Junior Officer to have that much
                    exposure to the different agencies around town.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you actually doing? What was your role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I forget who was the Ambassador, but it was when the new Ambassador was
                    first going out. [Ambassador Hadsel ed] He made a point of getting all the
                    different people who were called Ghana Desk Officers. You got the Ghana Desk
                    Officer from State; the Ghana Desk Officer from USAID; the Ghana Desk Officer
                    from Commerce; the Ghana Desk Officer from the Treasury; the Ghana Desk Officer
                    from USDA. You know, you pulled all these different people together who were the
                    Ghana Desk Officers, quote, unquote and tried to start up a process where we
                    would talk to each other and partially results of that process, it really became
                    more my role to represent Ghana. But, the other people were Ghana Desk Officers,
                    but they really represented Commerce Department's attitude to Ghana, rather than
                    trained to represent Ghana's position to the Commerce Department. I started in
                    that process of all the Ghana desk people getting together and talking and
                    recognizing what a different perspective each Agency rep had. But, it built
                    into, the USAID Ghana Desk Officer was the representative of the country. Much
                    more so than representing the U.S. to the country. That in effect the role of
                    having to present the U.S. viewpoint was essentially the field missions.
                    Frequently, whatever final paper or position we came to got transmitted out to
                    the field, but I was the Ghana Desk Officer and I would try and make that
                    position more flexible in terms of things that were important to the
                    Ghanaians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any ideas specific of what you did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The one that keeps coming back to my mind again, again and again was the
                    PL480 program insisting that it was better to do food than it was to do
                    commodities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean on the debt issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: On the debt issue, I was repeating things that the Mission sent into me.
                    It was an area in which I had absolutely no expertise and no confidence to go
                    with an independent point of view. It was just trying to make sure that the
                    points that the Mission was making were made where they needed to be made to the
                    other agencies and basically, One of the best things about working on Ghana was
                    that you had a series of USAID Mission Directors in Ghana who had a lot of
                    creditability in Washington. Dick Cashin, before you went out there. It made it
                    easy then to represent things that the Mission were saying. And, then also over
                    that time that I developed a creditability through working with the other
                    agencies, and so that I would repeat what the Mission said, and it wasn't a
                    question of rubber stamping something that was being said by somebody who was
                    unreliable to begin with. It was a creditable story and you had a good basis
                    going in for saying, “Okay, look, these are the problems.” And, that if you push
                    here, maybe the demands get accepted, but if you push too hard, all you're doing
                    is setting yourself up for a failure, because they won't be able to meet your
                    terms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else in that particular period? This was quite an
                        introduction wasn't it to USAID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It was an extraordinary introduction, in that I had a series of Mission
                    Directors that I worked with. Don Brown was Zaire; Dick Cashin was in Ghana. I
                    was working with really topnotch people overseas and had a series of good bosses
                    in Washington, Steve Christmas and David Shear. I probably learned more from
                    Steve Christmas than anybody I've ever worked for. Steve sat me down and he said
                    basically, “Hariadene, it's okay to tilt at windmills. It's something that you
                    do; it's a good part of your personality and it's something that every
                    government agency needs, but you have to pick your windmills, you can't tilt at
                    them all.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good point, good point. He was a first rate person.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: That he was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, and then after that where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I worked on Ghana from '67 until '72.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's quite a considerable period, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes. It was mostly working on Ghana, but I also had responsibilities for
                    Liberia and basically, the people didn't feel that crooks ever got punished.
                    That if once they were arrested, he'd buy off the policeman or he'd buy off the
                    judge and that the only punishment that would be given would be what they gave
                    right there on the spot.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Right. So, I took it as a lack of faith in any institution. This was
                    very much you did it personally, if you wanted to see it get done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand. Were there any other observations from that
                        first visit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I fell in love with Africa. I'd taken a couple of courses on Africa in
                    Graduate School, but if anything I'd probably concentrated more on Southeast
                    Asia. So, that was my first real exposure to Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What made you fall in love with Africa? What was it
                        about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: A feeling of being alive, a feeling very much of the newness that the
                    world was open to anything, anything and everything. A feeling, I don't know, to
                    me it's what the U.S. must have been like during the frontier days. A sense that
                    it was a new country and that they could establish it and shape it, and a sense
                    of optimism that they had no doubts they could do it. I remember sitting at the
                    hotel getting into all these long discussions with various British ex-patriots
                    who would sit around and moan about the fact that Ghanaian Africa was not ready
                    for self-government and that they really should have maintained the colonies a
                    little longer. My final argument use to be that Chicago wasn't ready for self
                    government either. They didn't appreciate that. But, basically it was the view
                    of Europeans, well the British specifically, I guess, that (the early work I did
                    with USAID was all in Anglophone countries).The British view was that, you know,
                    that somehow the U.S. had done them wrong by pressuring the them to turn loose
                    of the African colonies before they were really ready for self government. A
                    strong feeling on my part that Chicago is not ready for self-government. Today,
                    I would probably say that Washington, D.C. is ready for self-government, but you
                    got to wait until somebody is ready. You learn how to self-govern by doing it
                    and it's one of those things that you just plunge in. You make your mistakes and
                    you learn from them and you move on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you work on other things while you were there? How
                        long were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The initial trip was just a couple of weeks. Later, I was out there for
                    a couple of months. The desk at that point covered also Liberia and Zaire and so
                    I did stop overs in those two countries.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find situations there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The U.S. official policy for Zaire at that time— this was 1968—was that
                    we would be finished and out of there by 1970. The assistance program was a
                    short term, an emergency program and we could then leave. I thought that that
                    wouldn't work and it was going to be a long, long time before the country
                    outgrew the need for any kind of technical assistance, either institutionally or
                    financially or infrastructure or anything. Probably out of that particular mini
                    revolt that they had down in the south in Lubumbashi, it had been settled, but
                    considering the size of that country you simply had no ethnic homogeneity to
                    hold it together. They were probably going to have a series of Civil Wars,
                    coups, etc. etc. etc.</p>
                <p>Liberia is one of the few countries in Africa that in my very first visit I found
                    depressing. It was a country in which the America-Liberians had such a tight
                    hold on the country. The governing elite were in miniature the same as the Brits
                    would say about Ghana. And, so there was really a very, very small elite
                    maintaining a very small control and hiding behind the shadow of civilian
                    elections. I found it a country, but at that time, what did I do in Liberia ...
                    I can't even remember. As I think I recall capital projects — at that point
                    capital assistance was handled by a different office, the Project Development
                    Officer, the Capital Projects Officer. So, I passed messages back and forth on
                    some road projects. In '69 or so, by which time the Washington organization was
                    Ghana, Liberia, Zaire, Sierra Leone. Steve Christmas was the officer in charge
                    of the whole conglomeration.</p>
                <p>There was a project in Liberia. It was called the JFK Hospital where we had put
                    in a modern hospital in Monrovia. The Indian Public Health Service, which had
                    the technical assistance contract, had come up with data on the recurrent costs
                    for operating the hospital, after we had finished the capital infrastructure.
                    They'd come up with a budget of what it would cost the Liberian government to
                    run it. It was like five times what anybody expected it to be, and probably ten
                    times higher than what the Liberian government could come up with. And, so USAID
                    had us send an evaluation team out to Liberia to really look at what were the
                    alternatives to do something about the JFK Hospital. Was there any way we could
                    redesign it, reorganize it, salvage it; it was turning into a major
                    embarrassment. The man on my desk who had basically handled Liberia refused to
                    go. He thought it was such a can of worms he didn't want to touch it. So, Steve
                    asked me if I would go and I said, sure. Ed Hogan, who at that time was Director
                    of the Africa Bureau Development Program Office was the team leader. He and I
                    headed out to Monrovia to look at this hospital. I probably learned more during
                    that trip about diplomacy than I did any other time in my life. It was three
                    weeks of concentrated diplomacy of watching Ed Hogan try to manipulate and bring
                    together the Liberian government, the Mission, the Embassy, and the Indian
                    Health Service.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your understanding of why it was built in the
                        first place?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: I'm trying to remember. I think at that point in the late '60s and early
                    '70s and it never entirely went away, but I would say it was probably stronger
                    than as if the official government, if a foreign government officially requested
                    X of the U.S. government, unless we had some reason not to, you know, that's
                    what we'd do. [It was a commitment to President Tubman by President Kennedy
                    during Tubman's visit to the U.S. ed] The different country programs were
                    written up and submitted to Washington every year as a country program, and they
                    were submitted to the Congress in country-by-country presentations. For Liberia,
                    you really didn't have a consistent country program where the parts fitted
                    together so that the accomplishment of all those different pieces would make
                    some significant difference in the country. Bob Nooter who was Mission Director
                    and I think, Steve Christmas was Program Officer at that time before he came
                    into Washington. But, they did a country presentation where they did one through
                    ten of the high priority things that should be done in that country, given the
                    basic issues that had to be overcome. And, parallel to that they did one through
                    ten of what the U.S. funds were actually going for, and nowhere did the two
                    lists overlap.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember what were on these lists and what should
                        have been done or any of those?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I remember that on the list of things that we were doing, there were a
                    fair amount of health activities; there was a fair amount of road building. I
                    don't really remember what else we were doing, some agricultural projects. The
                    impression was that they were all fairly scattered. They're much like in the
                    U.S. when you have a road project when the House passes a transportation bill.
                    It consists of a number of roads, which makes sense if you look at West Virginia
                    or Idaho or Florida. Basically, those types of projects were what we did in
                    Liberia, based upon the relative political pull of different representatives
                    through different counties. Essentially, we got into, but the list of what we
                    should be doing was more in education. Fewer capital construction projects and
                    more institutional development.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>I remember the hospital. Essentially, we did the hospital, because President
                    Tubman asked for a hospital. The hospital had, actually it had two wings and one
                    wing had an elevator and it went up to Tubman's floor where he had his own three
                    private hospital wards in case he got sick. The problem was the high recurrent
                    cost budget which was related to the type of construction where it was done in
                    two wings and they were very separate. You didn't have any efficiencies. That
                    was because how Tubman wanted it. He wanted one wing just for him and for other
                    presumable members of his family. The other reason that the thing was so
                    incredibly expensive, was the Indian Public Health Service (IPHS) essentially
                    did what they called the honest budget. The customary system at that time was
                    for four nurses to be assigned to each ward. Two nurses were assigned to the
                    ward were actually girlfriends of the Admissions Officer and they never showed
                    up on the floor. But, they received their salary. So, we had two people doing
                    the work of four people. So, being in Public Health Service in Liberia, which
                    has gotten nowhere in trying to get Civil Service-type standards where you don't
                    get paid unless you show up. IPHS decided, okay, they would budget for six
                    people. The two that never showed up and the four who were supposed to be there
                    and work on the floor. And, that sort of went throughout the whole system. They
                    budgeted the amount that got ripped off from the Hospital Administrator then,
                    plus the amount that they needed. Focusing attention on how totally
                    inefficiently that place was run, they probably couldn't have done any better. I
                    mean, they really did get everybody exercised about the problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Liberians in charge of the operation or were they
                        just interested in how IPHService ran it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: The Indian Public Health Service, well when we first built the hospital,
                    the idea was that we would have a technical assistance team out there for four
                    years that would help establish the use of this facility. They worked in the old
                    hospital while the new one was being constructed and then they were supposed to
                    turn the new one over to the government and then the government would then have
                    people trained ready to run the new one. The Indian Public Health Service was
                    doing the technical assistance and absolutely totally not getting anywhere. The
                    only doctors who they felt had any sense of competence and dedication to duty
                    were Liberian natives who had managed to get some type of medical training. And,
                    the American Liberians didn't want them at the hospital. The American Liberian
                    doctors were basically viewed by the Indian Public Health Service as
                    incompetent, inefficient, corrupt and not worth the time of day. In the mean
                    time, when they came up with this budget of how much it would cost to run the
                    new hospital, the Liberian government's first line of attack was to ask us to
                    come up with the money to pay for it and provide the recurring costs after we
                    finished building it. We said no to that and so then they refused to accept the
                    building. I think, at one point, we got as far as having, a member of the
                    Kennedy family who was supposed to fly there and the date was all established
                    and then they refused to participate. But, we built a hospital that could be
                    neither run nor maintained and so therefore, they wouldn't take it and we could
                    have it. They used to jerk the U.S. chain. They had the Ambassador trying to
                    find a solution for them. I guess in terms of other political programs either
                    Haiti, Grenada or such, this was small potatoes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you recommend any solutions in the report?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I was totally on the side of the Indian Public Health Service. I felt we
                    had a no choice, since we'd been unable to correct the situation we should go
                    ahead and provide the extra money. And, if that meant budgeting for six nurses
                    when only two showed up, then that's what we should do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And with the U.S. financing the budget?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: With the U.S. financing the budget. The U.S. let itself be manipulated
                    into creating the problem. I mean, it wasn't our problem to begin with. If we'd
                    had a free hand in designing the hospital, we would have designed a different
                    hospital. I'm convinced based on everybody that I talk to, that we built this
                    high tech monstrosity that nobody could run or maintain, because we gave into
                    Tubman who wanted a demonstration project, so we should therefore go ahead and
                    pay for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it function? Was there any need for it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: They needed a hospital. They were trying to set up at that time what
                    essentially was rural public health system, which would provide primary care,
                    referred to regional centers for secondary care with major complex cases
                    referred to the hospital for advanced care. They were all part of a well
                    organized country-wide system. In the mean time, we had spent this money
                    building this fancy hospital in Monrovia and still hadn't gotten the rural
                    health posts established, or constructed.Q: That was part of the original plan
                    wasn't it?</p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It was part of our original plan. It was not part of the Liberian
                    original plan.</p>
                <p>The evaluation basically came out that the Indian Public Health Service had built
                    in an extortionate budget and you didn't need as many people as they said you
                    needed; and you didn't need as many commodities as they said they needed.
                    Basically, the Indian Public Health Service position was, that if you didn't
                    order one hundred and fifty percent of what you needed, that you would wind up
                    with only 50 percent going to the patients and the other 50 percent being on the
                    black market somewhere. As far as I could see, basically they were right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, that's not a policy, you could justify?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I don't remember. I'd had less than a year and a half with the Federal
                    government at this point and I didn't see any reason to go ahead and just write
                    it off. If we couldn't make the Liberians change, we had no hope of getting rid
                    of the corrupt hospital administrators or the doctors who were supposedly there,
                    but never showed up for service, etc. etc., that we should go ahead and admit it
                    and pay enough to get proper care at the hospital. We got back to Washington,
                    and the Senior team member, Ed Hogan, essentially said that the hospital could
                    be run for much less than what the Indian Public Health Service proposed and
                    that we should extend some technical assistance here. Basically, as far as I was
                    concerned it was filling in the edges. You weren't going to wind up with a
                    project that you could be proud of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were talking about the JFK hospital as an example of
                        how projects evolve and get into trouble. Where did you come out in the end
                        on the JFK hospital project? What was your group doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: An independent evaluation. I thought we ought to go ahead and, well, you
                    really had two options. You could essentially take a hospital that was built and
                    nail a two by four over the door and never open it, which I felt was probably
                    unacceptable to all parties that were concerned. Or, you could take the hospital
                    and say, okay, we now have a hospital in Liberia according to Liberian standards
                    and at the same time achieve some level of health care. We'll take a budget that
                    is one hundred and fifty percent of what you normally have and that we ought to
                    go ahead and have the Liberians come up with, you know, the first year have 30
                    percent of the budget and we'd cover 70s percent. By the fifth year it would be
                    50/50; and the year ten we would turn over the whole operation. Some way,
                    whereby we would go ahead and have a hospital that ran at a functioning level.
                    That was basically unacceptable, just the thought of what the auditors and the
                    Inspector General would say. And Liberian doctors who never showed up to work,
                    or knowing that funding pharmaceuticals were 50 percent lost. There just wasn't
                    a good practical decision.</p>
                <p>I think that I mentioned earlier that when I first came to USAID, I got the
                    feeling that I was a very small cog in a very large machine and really
                    questioned whether or not what I did really make a difference. There's a book
                    out which was actually a true story in Liberia of how USAID reacts to politics,
                    which I read and was horrified at it. I think the main solution for them at that
                    point was to offer scholarships to the U.S. Anyway, I was worried about being
                    this very small cog in this large machine that wouldn't have any impact or
                    alternatively, that I would get basically corrupted. Not in a sense of getting a
                    kicked back on contracts or something like that, but that I'd stopped caring.
                    You know, just that it is okay, that's the program, just go with the
                    program.</p>
                <p>Two things that made me change that opinion. One was this project in Liberia,
                    because what we would do about the project was being decided. Phil Birnbaum, who
                    was the Deputy Assistant Administrator (Africa Bureau) at that point, called
                    Steve Christmas in and Steve took me along with him. Phil and Steve were talking
                    about more or less practical ways that you could keep this thing from being a
                    total embarrassment. Such as get the government to accept it and then after that
                    it would be their problem as to how they ran it. So, in the middle of all this,
                    Steve said, “Well, I just feel like we ought to hear just what Hariadene has to
                    say.” So, he opened up the conversation to let me put all of my reservations,
                    complaints and everything else on the table. I felt so positive by working in an
                    Agency where you could do that, that you could put your ideas on the table. It
                    didn't mean that you always got them accepted, but it just made a hundred
                    percent difference in me that I had a chance to present them and that it was
                    accepted behavior. It was something where I had to worry about what this was
                    going to do to my evaluation, etc. etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How are your views greeted?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Phil said, we can't do that. Basically, his point was that, it is a
                    political project and a political country and his point of view was, how do we
                    get out of it with the least damage done; the least damage done to overall
                    U.S/Liberian relationships; the least damage done to USAID and USAID's budget.
                    This was never going to be a perfect project. There was nothing that USAID could
                    do that could make this into a functioning well run hospital. At this point, how
                    can we get out of it with the least damage done, and then in the long run keep
                    working in the health sector in Liberia and try to bring about some of the other
                    health interventions that needed to be made in the long term.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just about the time we were going into these regional
                        approaches in mostly Francophone Africa, the Sahel, as you said, imploded
                        and you became part of the staff? When did you join that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I went to work on the Sahel program in '72 as an Assistant Director for
                    Program, which was a new office that they were setting up in the Central West
                    Africa Regional Office, where previously they had had a Desk Officer that
                    corresponded to the regional mission in the Senegal; a Desk Officer that handled
                    Cameroon; a Desk Officer that did Niger, and Upper Volta in Abidjan. Fermino
                    Spencer was the Director and Owen Cylke was the Deputy Director. The assignment
                    would come down that this is what we need and the Office Directors would pass it
                    to their Desk Officers and the Desk Officers would send it back up. The Deputy
                    Director gets to travel around a lot and serve as Acting Director whenever the
                    Director traveled. But, Owen felt that because of the way the Sahel program
                    worked, he couldn't send up separate reports from Senegal, Abidjan, Cameroon.
                    They need to send up something so it covered the whole area. It was different
                    work than other Deputy Directors did. It wasn't so much that it was different,
                    it was more than he could handle. And, to actually handle it properly you needed
                    a three person unit. You needed a Budget Officer, a Planning Officer, and
                    somebody in charge of the place, and so that was me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was after the Regional Office was ended?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The Regional Office in Washington was basically terminated and replaced
                    with something called Central West Africa Regional, which was managed by a
                    series of USAID Affairs Offices in the field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a geographic division.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: It was a geographic unit; he did not have all of the delegations of
                    authority that the previous Regional Director had. Because, some of the
                    authorities went to the Field Missions, but the field posts were not fully
                    empowered, so the delegations of authority that normally would be handled by
                    Mission Directors were split between the field and Washington. So, there was a
                    great involvement in programming decisions and in budget decisions made in
                    Washington as opposed to the field offices.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, this was a unique geographic office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It was different from the other geographic offices and it needed a
                    Program Officer in Washington to help pull together what was happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your assignment came to be the Program Officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Right. They set up the position of Director for Program and Capaferre
                    (ph) was the Budget Officer who kept everybody honest and Jess Snyder, who went
                    on to be Mission Director was the Planning Officer. All of this was also
                    happening at the same, almost in parallel courses, the Sahel office was
                    employing. They had set up an emergency office in Central West Africa Regional.
                    They found that they could not handle the emergency programs split among the
                    three Desk Officers and so they set up a separate office that would just handle
                    the emergency program, which was Hunter Farnham. Hunter had a staff of three,
                    four, or five people, I think where he was trying to backstop everything that
                    was going on in the emergency food aid, disaster relief effort, which because it
                    was the first of the environmental disasters, it was very difficult for the
                    Office of Disaster Relief, which normally would have handled all that kind of
                    effort. They weren't set up to handle something like that. It didn't really fit
                    their idea of their authorities, or what they could do, or what they couldn't
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The disaster that you perceived was happening in the Sahel
                        at that time was different from typical disasters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It didn't have a starting date and a stopping date. It wasn't something
                    that was geographically confined like a volcano or a hurricane. It was spread
                    out over thousands of miles; it was an accumulation of agricultural practices
                    and land management practices that had aggravated a very delicate, fragile
                    ecological system, to the point where you had estimates that the desert was
                    advancing by so many inches every year. But, essentially you had, the academic
                    guys that I believed (and here again, it's a question of who you want to believe
                    and who you talk to,) that you didn't have proof that there was a climatic
                    change, which in their terminology was something that happens over hundreds of
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they having a drought?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: You did not have a drought. What you had was, a previously five to 10
                    years period of a heavy wet season, where cattle herders had obviously pushed
                    further into the desert and pushed further north than they ever should have
                    done. The unusual out-of-cycle heavy rains had stopped. So, what people
                    perceived as being a drought or a climatic change was really much more a matter
                    of their getting rainfalls along the lines of what they normally would have
                    gotten over a 50 year period and you didn't get climatic shifts in less than
                    hundreds of years.</p>
                <p>Anyway, everybody was working on that all on one side while Hunter was trying to
                    move emergency food to people who normally would have been able to raise sorghum
                    or millet, and found out that there wouldn't be enough rainfall to germinate any
                    harvest and so they were headed south towards the coast. He was actually
                    pushing, I forget the numbers, (and at some point you really should interview
                    Hunter, because he remembers all the numbers.) But, it was like previous food
                    aid programs going into the Francophone Sahel. The Sahel states were Senegal,
                    Mali, Mauritania, Upper Volta, Niger, and Chad, and later got broaden to include
                    others. To a great extent there was a Sahelian impact that spread across a band
                    of Africa, so that you had the same thing was happening in the six Francophone
                    colonies that was happening in Ethiopia and Sudan on the other side of the
                    continent. Also, it hit Northern Ghana. The focus was on the six Sahel inland
                    countries. Hunter was trying to push food aid into those countries in magnitudes
                    and amounts and had never been done before. They were sending it in by truck
                    convoy starting in Algiers and going down across the Sahara Desert to get into
                    northern Mali. They were doing air drops in Chad where they had dependent
                    spouses flying along with the U.S. Air Force, because although air tower
                    controllers are supposed to be able to speak English, but just in case, they had
                    some French speaking people in the planes so they could dump the grain where
                    they were supposed to. They were going in by boat, by plane, everything except
                    camel.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a logistics nightmare.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Major logistics nightmare of which large amounts backed up; railroad
                    trains, that stopped running. You had everything again to the point where you
                    wound up with the Government of Chad insisting that the trucks that brought the
                    grain in from Douala and Cameroon and coming up through Nigeria after landing in
                    Lagos and coming across country, had to unload at the Chad border and a Chad
                    trucking company had to be used, which just so happened to be owned by his
                    brother-in-law. They didn't have the trucks, so you wound up with getting
                    everything funneled into this one bottle neck and that there weren't enough
                    trucks to move the food. Again, we wound up caring more about getting food to
                    the starving people, etc. than the government of Chad did, so that the leverage
                    in terms of negotiations about who does what was very much on their side. But,
                    Hunter essentially was running a major logistical support operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No. My involvement at approximately the same time... Either the head of
                    USAID or the State Department or somebody was convinced that Fermino Spencer
                    couldn't handle it and that Fermino should have help. So, the first help they
                    provided was Ed Hogan who was supposed to be looking at the longer term moving
                    from this emergency program to short range relief and rehab program. Then they
                    decided that Hogan couldn't handle it, so they got Ed Faye. Ed Faye was supposed
                    to be looking at the long range plan. Then they decided that that group needed
                    some more help, so they added Prince Lyman. Once again, it became an amalgamated
                    mission.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it that they handled? What was the issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The issue was to do the thinking and the planning and the organization
                    for everything beyond emergencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year are we talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: '72. It all kind of happened in '72, '73.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was at the same time the drought was an emergency or
                        what ever you call it.JOHNSON: You had Hunter running the emergency, you
                        know, humanitarian. Separate apart from the emergency humanitarian, although
                        Hunter was supposed to be reporting to Fermino. But, the USAID office was
                        set up to do short term, medium term, long term planning working overall on
                        how you could, drought proof the area; it is the wrong word, because you
                        can't drought proof an area. But, how could you make the area better
                        equipped to handle short term emergencies like Hunter was handling. What
                        could you do as a short term program that would provide a bridge to begin
                        moving people into development activities, rather than just being the
                        recipient of emergency activities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting that this requirement was identified
                        almost right at the outset of the emergency. That's interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No. I wasn't there at the very beginning, but I was there within the
                    first year. I know my part was to work as Assistant Director for Program; they
                    said I was to work on the short term, medium term, long term. It wound up with
                    Ed Hogan, Ed Faye, Prince Lyman, and me, that was pretty much the planning
                    group.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who did you report to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I reported to Owen Cylke</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean the whole group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Oh, the whole group, I was in charge of it. My rank or title or anything
                    else I wasn't in charge. They were all more senior than I and they headed other
                    kinds of things. But, I was the only one that was full time on that particular
                    problem. At one point Don Brown tried to formally establish it, and I think
                    there may actually be a cable somewhere in the archives of USAID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Don Brown was then the Deputy Assistant
                        Administrator?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Don was Deputy AA for the Africa Bureau. He was doing his best to try
                    and keep peace between Fermino and Hogan and Ed Faye, all of whom were very
                    strong personalities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very, right. So what did you do? What did you come up with
                        in working with this group and trying to deal with the short, medium, long
                        term?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: A lot of hand holding of letting everybody talk about what they would do
                    if they ran the universe and getting different sorts of perspectives from each
                    of the different people and then trying to figure out what could be put together
                    and who would do what.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contractors involved in doing studies for
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: We did as it grew. As it was first set up, well again, I can't swear
                    that this was all at the same time, but it felt like it was all at the same
                    time. I don't remember the luxury of being able to finish this and then move to
                    that and then to that. But, what we did was we, our Congressional Liaison was up
                    on the Hill working with people and was making the arguments and that both
                    Hunter and I and the people in disaster relief were feeling that disaster relief
                    didn't work. That the environmental disaster that was cutting across boundaries
                    and was long term in nature; it wasn't something that started and stopped within
                    90s days and that you needed legislative authority. if we were going to handle
                    it. So, we got a special provision into the Legislation that was for Sahel
                    relief and rehabilitation. Now there's X million dollars available without
                    regard to other provision of the Act; you can do whatever you think needs to be
                    done out there. And, I give Don Brown, DAA then a hell of a lot of credit for
                    negotiating that through the Hill. He had, I think more creditability, because
                    he had come from Zaire and so he knew the Francophone area, even if he hadn't
                    actually been in the Sahel itself.</p>
                <p>The original provision was for so much for relief and rehab that essentially went
                    for..., some of it went to back up Hunter's emergency operation, but some of it
                    went into what we call relief and rehab projects where we had three different,
                    no. For that particular effort, we had Ed Hogan who led a team that went to
                    Chad, Niger, Upper Volta, Mali, Mauritania and Senegal, basically working with
                    U.N. projects and identifying things that the U.S. could pick up, but another
                    donor had already designed or had nearly ready to go, or had planned to go for
                    the next year, but could be accelerated up to this year. They came back with an
                    R and R package of projects for the six Sahelian countries that could be done in
                    a reasonably quick fashion and have some impact upon expanding the capacity of
                    the area. It was a pretty broad criteria. You know, expanding the capacity of
                    the area could be almost anything. Ed Hogan was doing that, then Owen Cylke was
                    working on what kind of staff would you need overseas in these countries if you
                    funded these programs that along with identifying what we think we'll fund.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Since we got this much money from Congress that we could move into the area as an
                    emergency program, we wanted to move it fast; and the only way to move it fast
                    was if you have people in the field: what kind of an organization; what kind of
                    an legal organization should you set up in the field; and how would you staff
                    it; and what authorities would you give them. The options were expanding from
                    the existing posts in Senegal, Niger, Cameroon; expanding the REDSO operation
                    out of Abidjan; putting people in country in each of the six countries and
                    having them report to the regional headquarters. So, you'd have somebody in Mali
                    and Mauritania, but they'd report to the regional office in Senegal who'd report
                    to Washington. Or, have basically that you would have independent missions, one
                    in Senegal; an equal one in Mali; an equal one in Mauritania. They'd all report
                    separate apart from anybody else; the system of saying, okay, you're not going
                    to get a full fledged mission set up overnight. So, what we'll do initially is,
                    we'll put one portion out there. They'll be a relief and rehab officer and they
                    will work strictly under that mandate, and they will report to Washington. Well,
                    many of the Mission Directors in Abidjan and Senegal did not liked that. They
                    really objected in different degrees it took to negotiate their dream getting
                    along with the program to the point where Dr. Adams, who was in the Assistant
                    Administrator for the Africa Bureau wound up going on a trip to the Sahel to,
                    one, report back on the efficiency of the emergency program; was it reaching the
                    people? Second, it was to knock some heads that we were expanding; we were
                    putting them in different posts. I got to go along with Dr. Adams as his escort
                    officer, which was really fun, because at that point, Dr. Adams was having
                    cancer of the throat and had been having all kinds of chemotherapy and he wasn't
                    supposed to be talking. So, I was supposed to do all of his talking for him on
                    this trip. So, I got briefings from Don Brown and all of the other senior
                    people: above the level of what I normally would have been allowed to
                    participate in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went on this trip and when was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It would have been sometime in '72, '73. I know we went first to Chad,
                    and they had all these refugee camps which essentially were set up in this
                    blazing sun, blazing desert heat. You had one little twig supporting some
                    canvas. It may be four inches off the ground and people huddled under the canvas
                    trying to get some shade. We went to refugee camps and the doctors that were
                    with the refugee camps were just so busy; as he went down the line he would
                    point at and say, “That child will be dead by night; that child will be dead by
                    night; that woman may last two days; that child will be dead by night.” As a
                    first time, it sounds weird, but it's the first time I ever realized that there
                    were things that you couldn't control. That if we had a C-130 that could land,
                    you know, there's no airport that could take a C-130, but if we had an airport
                    that could take a C-130, and if we flew all of these people directly to John
                    Hopkins Medical School, you couldn't save them. That kind of an impact was just
                    incredible. This is after I had been working with USAID five or six years and
                    theoretically knew that the third world is not the same as the first world. This
                    story just had an enormous impact on me and my recognition of the limits of what
                    you can do and what you can't do. Then we went from there to Niger and met the
                    Ambassador in Niger.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the upshot of that trip?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The upshot of the trip was that we set up individual missions. Separate
                    and independent missions were set up in Chad, Mali, Mauritania, Upper Volta,
                    Niger. We picked USAID Affairs Officers. We recruited them and talked to them
                    about the plan to move them into USAID reps as soon as possible. And, it would
                    depend on how soon we could get approval from State in terms of number of
                    Americans in the country; how soon we could recruit, etc. etc. etc. But, from
                    the first, we recruited with the idea that they were going to be Mission
                    Directors; we got an extraordinary group of people, I think, because of
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of a study did you have behind the process of
                        moving out of the emergency into rehabilitation and longer term development?
                        Was there a clear strategy in mind of what you were supposed to do or how to
                        go about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Initially, we started out with the emergency: and short term R and R,
                    life support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Life support as opposed to saving lives. You could put in those
                    institutional kinds of assistance that were needed such as a port manager who
                    could clear a port. Somebody who would be eligible under the emergency. A port
                    manager or a technical assistance project to improve port management across the
                    board would be something that we would put under the short term relief and
                    rehab. Again, basically we worked a lot with the U.N. on picking up U.N.
                    projects that would help expand the capacity to endure the drought.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: In emergency phase there were two problems. You had across the Sahel
                    cattle men between 45 and 50 trying to save their herds by moving their cattle
                    south; you had those cattle herd penetrations going into areas that had been
                    agricultural areas for 15 to 20 years. So, part of what we did was try and
                    provide excess capacity, if you will, so that the livestock group could move
                    south without at the same time destroying and upsetting settled agriculture.Q:
                    What kind of capacity are you talking about?</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Primarily that involved putting up corrals and fencing in some of the
                    agricultural areas; putting in watering holes; trying to get the Israeli
                    government involved by sending someone to be the mediator, if you will, of
                    recognizing that all these herds were headed south. You know, this problem is
                    coming and neither USAID nor the French or anybody else can have people out in
                    all 500 villages. But, this is something where we would fund a seminar, for
                    example, for what would pass as an Extension Service in Mali and have people
                    say, “Look, this is what's happening. You got nomadic herdsmen coming into
                    settled areas, the kinds of frictions that we predicted that are going to happen
                    and here's some of the things we could do. Anthropologists out of Abidjan played
                    a big role in pulling together consultants who could lead those seminars in
                    identifying or working with various hosts governments in convincing them that
                    that kind of assistance was needed. This is across the board, I think,
                    REDSO/Abidjan really provided, if you will, the excess capacity to help get us
                    over the fact that we didn't have anybody in most of these countries, as well as
                    having the particular skills like anthropologists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the MIT study undertaken, at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: That was separate. I'm working my way through that. This is working
                    through the relief and the rehab, then we had the medium term. The medium term
                    program was basically what would be a normal program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A bilateral assistance plan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: A bilateral assistance plan for each of these countries where previously
                    there would only have been regional programs under one or more of the regional
                    institutions. For that, we wound up sending Princeton Lyman. Princeton set up a
                    week long seminar in Washington bringing in a whole series of consultants who
                    were going out as three teams. One team was going to Senegal; Senegal, Mali, and
                    Mauritania. One was going to Niger, doing Niger and Upper Volta; one was going
                    to Cameroon and Chad. We pulled together these consultants for three separate
                    teams and had all three teams in Washington for either a week or two weeks,
                    where we organized a series of seminars that were given to everybody who was
                    headed out to the field. The argument being that there was a wealth of knowledge
                    at the World Bank and enough in French on Francophone Africa; the U.S. knowledge
                    on the Francophone Africa was limited So, we had three teams head out: they were
                    not to do regional programs, that was a major fight whether they were to do a
                    regional program or three sub-regional programs or country programs. The major
                    fight was whether they wanted to do one regional program for the whole area or
                    sub-regional programs for Senegal, Niger, Cameroon or individual country
                    programs. The decision was made that we would do individual country programs.
                    One team went to the Cameroon and Chad and I think Ed Faye headed the team for
                    Niger and Upper Volta, and I don't remember who did Senegal, Princeton perhaps.
                    Anyway, we had three separate teams go out and brought them back to Washington
                    and did country programs for each of the six countries. Basically, the staffing
                    and the organization was pragmatic; really firmly establishing that we were
                    moving into those countries, those bilateral countries and the days of the Korry
                    report were gone; we didn't worry about it any more. Approximately, during that
                    same time period, Princeton was working on a long range contract on what the
                    long range development prospects of the area were. This turned into the famous
                    million dollar contract with MIT, which turned into an even more infamous
                    meeting with the six Ministers of the planning from Sahelian countries. Our
                    newly established MIT planning team came down to Washington and the six
                    ministers were in town for an IMF/World Bank meetings and so we had them all
                    over at the State Department. MIT had a sub-contract with the University of
                    Arizona and they had them come in from Arizona. We had a big kickoff meeting
                    with everybody there about here's why we wanted to have people looking at the
                    long range problem, because there were other people who were working on
                    day-to-day survival and intermediate term results, but we really need to think
                    in longer terms. Then, MIT made their opening statement about, we really are
                    interested in working on this, we think that it's a fantastic opportunity to
                    really start at the beginning and do some long range programming so that all the
                    immediate emergency things can be done within the context of a long term
                    program. You may have wondered about the selection of MIT since the Sahel is
                    primarily an agricultural area and MIT doesn't have a lot of expertise in that
                    area, but we hired the University of Arizona to provide that expertise. The
                    Planning Minister from Mali totally blew it; he lost his temper. He said, “We've
                    got the expertise.” MIT said they have hired Arizona with land expertise and
                    they are going to spend two weeks in Paris to get all the French archives and
                    the French history about that area and then be well qualified to come to Africa
                    and talk about our problem.” And, the Mali Planning Minister said, “You don't
                    need to talk to those people. We're the ones that have the knowledge. We're the
                    ones who sit in the middle of the agricultural land. We have hundreds of years
                    of experience in the Sahel. We know what's worked and what hasn't worked, forget
                    talking to the French.” I think it took literally another three months before
                    MIT could dig itself out of that hole.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was MIT selected?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I don't know. Princeton thought they had to do this proposal. I don't
                    even know if they did it on a competitive basis or if it was a sole source
                    selection. I think MIT had the expertise in doing modeling and that was the
                    latest edge in the development game. It was sort of an acknowledgment of the
                    fact that they didn't have the agricultural knowledge, you know, they brought in
                    the University of Arizona. They just dug a hole that first meeting that it took
                    them a good three to six months to dig out of. It was supposed to be a year long
                    contract where they had the results and present them to Congress a year
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to the contract?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: The basic contract, the basic report that they made was not accepted by
                    anybody. It was not accepted by the African governments; it was not accepted by
                    Congress. Princeton was a strong advocate, but I don't think he ever had the
                    troops in back of him, you know, on accepting it. Basically, what the MIT
                    modeling process came out with, was they did a demographic projection of so many
                    people and the carrying capacity of land for the livestock and concluded that
                    the six Sahelian States can't make it. The only way you can put it into a longer
                    term development perspective is setting up an arrangement where the inland
                    country states provide the manpower for the developed coastal states, so that
                    Niger's future depended upon sending all of its men down to Nigeria to work in
                    Nigeria. And, Mali and Mauritania the same thing, basically. And, basically none
                    of the African countries would accept that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your view of that conclusion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I was so buried in organizational stuff I don't know that I really
                    thought that much about it. I guess my main feeling was, it was a non-starter,
                    because you didn't have the Africans supporting it. And, that was partially due
                    to the fact that MIT had just gotten off onto the wrong foot with every senior
                    minister that they then had to work with. Also, a feeling that, if in fact all
                    of the development plans and programs and ideas that the various Sahelian
                    countries had in mind, (most of which involved a large steel mills, irrigated
                    agricultural development, which involved putting up dams and harnessing rivers
                    and displacing thousands and thousands of people who currently made a living in
                    the areas that would be flooded. But, all of that failed, none of it came to
                    pass.) Then, what MIT was suggesting would happen anyway. People will migrate
                    because that is where the jobs are. It was one of the risk aversion factors,
                    that that had been a part of the risk sharing for ages, i.e., when the weather
                    got bad up north, then the men and the cattle headed south.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And in a way, the MIT conclusion, poorly put and all that
                        was not far off in terms of the interaction of the coast and the inner
                        countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It is one theoretical outcome. It meant that when they did the
                    population and the demographic and the livestock numbers, when they did all the
                    projections that they made that was the only outcome that would work. I think
                    that's what was unacceptable to the African governments, because they had a lot
                    of other things in mind about irrigated agriculture and building projects
                    providing jobs that we had in our own country.Q: But, even if it was right, it
                    was politically.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Even if it was right, it was presented in such a way that it alienated
                    the people that it was supposed to be providing a long term answer to. It also
                    alienated the chief African staffers on the Hill who had been very much in
                    support of expanded funds for Africa. We wound up doing what became the Sahel
                    Development Program, which was a ten year budget, a ten year life of effort, if
                    you will, with funds being appropriated each of those ten years, made available
                    for a long term development in Sahel. We set up essentially criteria that had to
                    be met; it had to be long term, multi-country and I forget the rest. Anything
                    that was a buzz word we would throw into the program and basically wound up with
                    a protected funding source that was above and beyond what the Africa Bureau
                    got.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the heart of this strategy at that time? This was
                        in lieu of the MIT approach, but what was the strategy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The best I recall, it didn't have a strategic core. What it had was a
                    process, you know; you had a procedure that you were following.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you determine what you would do or not do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The procedure would give you your answers as you learned. Your procedure
                    would be that you world work with the other donors, so this wouldn't be just a
                    U.S. effort. It would be something that you would bring everybody along with the
                    Club du Sahel [the donors coordinating organization in Paris, ed] and the CILSS,
                    which was the French acronym for an inter-governmental Sahelian group based in
                    Upper Volta. But all of these different groups and countries were proposing what
                    they wanted to do. Some like Senegal wanted to put in a dam and move towards
                    irrigated agriculture. At least for 30 years they had had an organization called
                    the OMVS, which was dedicated to doing studies and finding funding for the dam.
                    It was to affect Mali, Mauritania and Senegal. And their long-range development
                    plan was based on funding the OMVS projects. Dr. Adams used to talk about the
                    OMVS office, a whole office building that they had built or some donor had
                    built, which was filled with studies. Partially, it was because a lot of this
                    stuff had been done by the French or in French and I guess we just never had it
                    and had access to it; and part of it was our standards, our conditions were
                    different. So it was a process that we told Congress that we didn't know if OMVS
                    represented the answer. We knew that there were these problems that , if you had
                    put in the dam you were going to have displaced lots of people, you were going
                    to have flooding, you were going to have blah, blah, blah; and that these were
                    all the problems that had to be solved before you went that direction. But we
                    wanted it to work this time; we would do it right. We would work with the other
                    donors and we would plan it out over time, etc. etc, etc. The idea was that this
                    would be multi-donor coordination, consultation, inter-governmental cooperation;
                    among the African governments, the CILSS would be the coordinating body and the
                    Club du Sahel would be the coordinating body among the donors.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What came out of the studies that went to the development
                        groups? Wouldn't that come up with desirable projects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Not really. The process basically was to cover the normal three to five
                    year development plan of what you do in those countries. Although, we assembled
                    an incredible quality and quantity of people to go out and do the plans, it in
                    essence became an exercise in hurry up, we've got to do this. So, that you
                    really didn't have project level detail, nor did you have the year, the 18
                    months of talking that the Missions would normally engage in before they got
                    together their programs. They'd be talking with the government and they'd be
                    wondering who in the government is effective, who's not effective, what works,
                    what doesn't work, what have we done in the past, do we want to build on and
                    expand. So, we didn't have all of the normal country level discussions, although
                    you had country level negotiations. You know, where we flew into town and we had
                    one USAID guy who was the R and R Officer who had probably been there less than
                    six months and we had the Embassy, who was delighted to see us, but didn't want
                    any more people. We could fly in and leave the money and fly out. I think, at
                    that point like for the R and R we had the special legislation we said,
                    notwithstanding any other provision.</p>
                <p>For the regular program that's three to five years before we would see it
                    started. You had to be within the basic functional categories of food and
                    nutrition, education, health, and population. One of our real problems was that
                    in the R and R phase, because you wanted to move quickly, both in starting
                    things and in completing things we wound up in every sector of activity in these
                    countries. Part of the process for the three to five year plan was to pull
                    everybody back together and say let's try and do two or three things that really
                    will matter, that will make a difference. And, that you can reasonably project
                    that you can make a change in three to five years. Towing icebergs down from the
                    Antarctic for irrigation water is not something we wanted to talk about. We
                    wanted to talk about three to five years, and it had to be essentially within
                    the functional categories. So, the results that we came back with were not
                    earthshaking or eye-opening. It was essentially stuff that had typically been in
                    the main stream of USAID activities. The one thing that I recall that we did do,
                    was Princeton Lyman made a really strong effort, argument in favor of doing
                    integrated rural development (IRD)projects. At that point, USAID did not have a
                    single IRD initiative and that this was something that we really should try, we
                    could experiment with it, see how well, etc. etc. etc. So, we wound up with an
                    IRD project in all six Sahelian countries. We wound up with water projects in, I
                    think, every country.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Irrigation, as well as watering holes for livestock. I can't remember
                    anything that sort of made one program more outstanding than other programs.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Each of the R and R Officers had things that they felt worked and had
                    made a difference. I don't know that we ever did an overall evaluation of that
                    program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, as you moved into the longer term, you had a
                        matrix of what the program structure was, but it also led in, didn't it, to
                        a major regional approach to projects, rather than country, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It was hybrid. It was a mixed type of approach. You had built-in from
                    the very beginning a regional type of framework, in that, you had this regional
                    approach, if you will, for the Central West Africa region with its USAID posts
                    in each of the three areas. You had a built-in predisposition to work with
                    regional organizations, dating back to the Korry report and a lot of those
                    regional organizations we wound up starting in order to have somebody to work
                    with. Some of those regional organizations worked very well. Others basically
                    could be criticized as hiring trained people from the individual countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember one that worked well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No, I really don't. The Club du Sahel, which was a donor creation, I
                    think worked well. It was far more, partially because of its birth history, but
                    also because of the people who staffed it in the early days. It was a very blunt
                    organization, that it was blunt with host governments, as to what was working
                    and what wouldn't work, and what should be tried that shouldn't be tried. It
                    developed a lot of creditability with the Hill. Ann, I can't think of her name,
                    a French woman was the first.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ann DeLattre?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, that was her. She developed a lot of creditability with the Hill
                    and we use to make sure that she'd be in town before we'd go to the Hill [with
                    budget requests ed] so that she could go around and talk to the Hill staff. She
                    was pretty blunt, but she wasn't just a cheerleader, The Club du Sahel was great
                    and it's working. She brought a time prospective to it; this is what you've
                    achieved in two years and you've got 25 to go; that type of feeling. I think the
                    CILSS with the coordination on the African side probably helped in the early
                    days, but essentially broke down. I mean, we never had really meaningful
                    negotiations where they had to do anything. They ended up acting as a fund
                    raiser. They had a couple of projects that they sponsored on things that were
                    across territorial lines, like the weather prediction project, and the early
                    days of the famine early warning system, some telecommunication projects, but I
                    don't think they were ever really seriously negotiating. If you wanted to
                    negotiate policy, that wasn't the group to negotiate with, you ended up in
                    bilateral negotiations. And, if you had major projects like the OMVS [dam and
                    irrigation program ed], you did it through Senegal, Mauritania, and Mali and the
                    OMVS organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the dialogue in the Club du Sahel between the African
                        representatives and the donors? I guess the Africans participated in the
                        meetings, didn't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The Club du Sahel met with the African countries, but my impression was
                    always that they, then, met with the donor countries bilaterally. They didn't
                    convene, come and let us all reason together. The Club du Sahel and the CILSS
                    were much more carrying the messages back and forth between the two groups and
                    basically saying to the African governments, “Look, this is what the donors
                    need. If they don't provide you any assistance you go to do X, Y or Z or else
                    they can't, you know. And, because the CILSS didn't have any money themselves,
                    you could tell them the truth, you know, because they didn't have any money
                    anyway. So, they couldn't fund your project or not fund your project. I think
                    they turned out to be a very useful intermediator. CILSS, like I said, wound up
                    raising funds for themselves and for projects that presumably benefited the
                    whole region. But, mostly negotiations became bilateral negotiations.</p>
                <p>You had a start at a fully integrated regional plan that MIT did. It took the
                    coastal countries, then the interior countries and looked at the whole thing.
                    But, the political reality was such there was actually nothing to keep that
                    alive. The Sahelian countries had some purpose in keeping CILSS alive, in the
                    sense that they saw it as another fund raiser. But, basically the six countries
                    were out for their own funds, you know and to attract the donors and come up
                    with the things that the donors felt interested in doing. There was no reason
                    for the coastal countries who were completely immersed in their own problems to
                    worry about what in the hell was happening in the Sahel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the glue that held donors (the Club du Sahel) and
                        the CILSS together for this rather large approach: the Sahel Development
                        Program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: The emergency. The emergency food relief disaster effort. That's what
                    held it together, because it was repeated not only in the Sahel with the drought
                    in '72, but you had one in '74, and then you had one in '76. You had repetitive
                    emergencies, because they were environmental emergencies. It wasn't something
                    that you could start or stop or prevent from happening. I think in many ways
                    that the fact that the donors saw the six Sahelian countries as a unit... I
                    mean, we'd call meetings like we call, you know, everybody would be in town for
                    a meeting with the IMF and World Bank so we'd have a side meeting with the six
                    Sahelian guys. Whereas, we would not necessarily say Nigeria, Sierra Leone, and
                    Ghana, all three of you guys (from the Sahelian countries) come in and meet
                    together, because you're a region. I think Africa went from an initial sort of
                    Pan Africanism, we could all be cooperative and etc. to really strongly felt
                    territorial borders. “I'm having a hard enough time dealing with what's inside
                    my borders, I'm not going to worry about the rest of you.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes. I think they became more and more introverted and I think now they
                    are coming out of it, but they're coming out of it in a military way; the
                    initial approach is military; whereas it would have been better, I think, if
                    there had been some other grounds on which they'd met. But, in affect like all
                    of the African countries sending in support in Zaire. The African countries that
                    tried to arrange a peace movement in Liberia; the initial intervention is at a
                    military level.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I think at the time there was such a pressure to move into a totally
                    different type of development relationship with both bilateral management
                    relationships, as well as with an increased American foreign policy move into
                    areas which had been clearly Francophone; as well as an enormous amount of money
                    that became available, because people became concerned about the humanitarian
                    drought problems of wanting to move in and fix these countries.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: I would really want to go back and check the numbers, but in my memory
                    you were talking about a pre-drought program of maybe 15 million dollars a year
                    spread among six Francophone countries, plus various regional projects or
                    regional organizations. You had three regional offices located among the six
                    countries. You had very small offices, as our contact was limited at the
                    interactive professional level. Clearly it was an area in which we did not have
                    a background knowledge of basic facts. You had two problems. One is the amount
                    of money that people wanted to move quickly and that Congress was willing to
                    make money available. We felt that we had to verify, show that we could use it
                    in order to lay the case for an increasing development relationship with the
                    countries. You had an overwhelming need for developmental assistance in these
                    countries whose economies had not grown since the Francophone period. They faced
                    many natural resource base problems of being interior states with long
                    transportation routes to the coast for importing and exporting, and a minimum
                    amount of infrastructure development within the countries, both physical
                    infrastructure and human infrastructure. It was just difficult figuring out in
                    the middle of all this, you know, what impacts you were having.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Partly we were talking about 15 million dollars, but then
                        it grew quite substantially didn't it, after that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It's over a hundred and fifty million, close to 200, I think at the
                    tops, including the humanitarian aid, as well as the development aid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For a year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yeah. Per year, and it grew. The first year we had a regular development
                    base of around 15 million dollars; the second year you had 50 million dollars of
                    humanitarian assistance; the third year you had a hundred and fifty million
                    dollars with some of it humanitarian assistance, some development assistance. It
                    sort of graded out, I think around a hundred and fifty a year for the five years
                    that I worked in the area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, in addition, you had a donor club, which provided
                        another substantial amount which probably brought it up close to a billion
                        dollars, do you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Easily. At the time the African Bureau in total was probably getting
                    around two hundred million in development assistance and maybe another hundred
                    million in foreign food aid.</p>

                <p>JOHNSON: No, for all of Africa. The food aid was split between some humanitarian
                    and some PL 480 Title II, which was going in through PVO, Private Volunteer
                    Organizations. And, even when we moved from the resource base up to the hundred,
                    hundred and fifty million level, we were still the minor donor in the region.
                    The French remained overwhelmingly the major donor; the World Bank came in as a
                    major donor. Then, you had some increases from EEC under the EEC Program, which
                    primarily went for physical capital types of programs and then you had an
                    increase in the U.N. Programs, which were technical assistance from all over the
                    place. I don't remember who all was in the Club du Sahel, but I think there were
                    around ten donors. The U.S. would have been considered a middling donor. What we
                    did when we first went in, we refused to accept the fact that there was a
                    limited capacity to absorb aid. We worked on the assumption that it was a donor
                    problem and that the donors could figure out ways to obligate and spend and
                    hopefully reap the benefits from it, and that the capacity problem was really
                    us. It was our way of doing business; the kinds of things we insisted that they
                    have to show or do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean our demands on them created a capacity
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Bigger demands upon the six Sahelian nations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Such as what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: You had the classic stories of all the donors providing computers, but
                    the computers were all different, so they had ten major donors and they had
                    probably 20 different computer systems and that would turn out with three
                    computer systems in one office. So, the computers would get put over in the
                    corner and gather dust.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lack of standardization in the country.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes. Was that the donor's fault or was that the host country's fault.
                    You flip a coin. I considered it more of the donor's problem, in that we had
                    problems in trying to merge a desire to show that U.S. assistance helped promote
                    U.S. exports by buying America. And, all of the other donors had the same kinds
                    of constraints. You wound up with projects like in Mauritania where we, and the
                    UNDP, and I've forgotten the third donor, built a road. Essentially, each donor
                    would build one-third of the road and the U.S. wound up building a third in the
                    middle, which didn't connect to anything at either end, because neither of the
                    other two donors came through with their promises assistance It was an attempt
                    by the donors to do multi-donor projects, which was an attempt to overcome the
                    proliferation problem with everybody doing something differently. So, everybody
                    would go in together, but then funding sequences and money cycles and technical
                    assistance planning in order to get the capital assistance were all different.
                    So, you wound up with some real anomalies that became added to the USAID's lore.
                    When I came out of the Sahel program after working three years in Washington and
                    two in the field, I was very negative that what the donors were doing would make
                    an impact. I felt that we, in many ways, had over-promised what we could do to
                    Congress in terms of the time frame.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did we say the time frame was? Do you remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Well, the Sahel Program started with the emergency and then moved into
                    special funds available for R and R, and then moved into something called the
                    Sahel Development Program, which at the time that it was developed that was like
                    later in the sequence. It was probably, I think around '75, '76 maybe. But, we
                    talked in terms of a ten-year time frame at that point. The total program was
                    supposed to be a ten-year multi-donor effort in which in the jargon of today,
                    you'd focus on the results. And, it was recognized that the results wouldn't
                    happen in year one or two, but that it was a long-range ten year program in
                    which it would be heavily loaded towards the end of the time period. What
                    happened when we got to the end of the time period, also coincided with a major
                    push by the African Bureau to get a change in the overall legislation and we
                    declared the Sahel a success and came home-that type of thing. And, then we
                    merged the Sahel Development Program into the Africa Development Program. You
                    never really had a completion or a closure on the Sahel. I think people went
                    back and they looked at individual projects; they certainly went back and looked
                    at the emergency in terms of how the emergency system had worked and what
                    lessons could be learned from it. I think there were attempts to go back and
                    look at the whole period, but that those attempts to look at a whole period
                    wound up without having the data. No one really had done the baseline data to
                    begin with, so you couldn't really show mega changes overall and you wound up
                    with a lot of vague information.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You talked about the ten year period. Was that too long,
                        too short?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Too short. Too short for the results that we promised. I think a much
                    more modest program probably still would have taken ten years. For what we
                    attempted to do in terms of overall infrastructure development throughout the
                    development, major policy changes by the governments We recognized, but we
                    didn't put enough emphasis on how tightly woven the Francophone influence, the
                    Francophone money system, and the existing relationship with Europe were built
                    into the culture. I think we had a lot of difficulty in working in that culture.
                    The French colonial experience and the English colonial experience were compared
                    in terms of what each colonial system left behind. I think the balance of
                    opinion was that the British left behind more trained people and more
                    functioning governmental systems. But, the French left behind a cultural
                    influence that was much deeper and much stronger than we ever gave credit
                    to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would it be manifest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I think the French were more realistic than we were in terms of
                    expectations. We worked very hard with the donor community to agree to a
                    partnership arrangement. You do this, French do this, we do this, the donors and
                    the host governments will sort of all work together. The French would sign off
                    on it, but I don't think in their hearts they really believed that any of it
                    would happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were they committed to the program? Why did they get
                        involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Paternalism, colonial paternalism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would they work with the other donors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: More, I think I have an overall feeling, well two feelings. One was a
                    global view that adults should work together. It was a feeling of responsibility
                    that we, everything in logic says that it would be better if donors work
                    together and we didn't pull in different directions. Secondly, I think they saw
                    it as an excellent opportunity to get other donors to come in and pick up part
                    of the aid load, and that they in affect either decrease their assistance or had
                    proportionally lower increases. Although, the ways of calculating what's
                    assistance and what's not assistance were so different you never could actually
                    pin them down. The Japanese were absolutely incredible. They would come to the
                    meeting and they would announce 20 million dollars worth of assistance. Two
                    years later you would have a follow-up meeting. None of the Japanese assistance
                    had started to flow, so they had the benefit of announcing once again that they
                    would provide 20 million dollars of assistance. They got more PR out of doing
                    less than any donor I ever saw.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are the criticisms or comments about the Sahel
                        Development Program? It was sponsored by USAID and so on. Was there a lack
                        of emphasis on building up institutional capacity; they were more concerned
                        with doing things, rather than with building up the kind of institutional
                        mechanisms that would enable them to do them. What was your feeling about
                        that issue? Did you have a sense that the institutional issues were
                        important at the time or should be addressed that had not been, or was that
                        not a particular concern or was it a concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I think that was at the time when the major concern was taking place in
                    a atmosphere both congressionally and with the public institutions that we
                    worked with, that USAID worried too much about institutions, that you could
                    spend years and years and years developing an institution and never have an
                    impact on the problem. Whereas, the PVO community had shown you could go in and
                    immediately change the day-to-day quality of life for people without waiting for
                    the institutions to catch up. I think a large part of that was wishful thinking
                    and that what the PVO community did was really successful only as part of a
                    package where USAID went in and got the government to change some of its
                    policies and where you had institutions that were headed up by essentially
                    non-corrupt competent personnel.</p>
                <p>In too many cases, I think our flirtation, if you will, with integrated rural
                    development projects, represented an attempt to go in and bypass governments. We
                    set up isolated areas that had their own sources of funding; they had their own
                    institutional personnel; they had their own policy frameworks. And they
                    frequently worked. You could actually see an improvement for the better inside
                    the integrated rural area. Donors left, it collapsed. It no longer had protected
                    funding; it no longer had the guarantee of getting the best of the best of the
                    institutional talent; and you didn't have the push behind it of having a donor's
                    technical personnel there to try and move it and make it happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The USAID people weren't aware of or sensitive to this
                        institutional issue for making these things lasting and sustainable?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: There were so many personalities involved. I don't think you could say
                    that in that community of people working on the problem; there were people that
                    were warning about the issues that people worried about. Some people worried
                    about it more than others. Princeton Lyman worried about the institutional
                    support that might be there. Mike Horowitz, who was an anthropologist out of
                    REDSO and was helping to design a lot of the programs, worried much more about
                    direct impact on people and working with local people. You had a broad area, a
                    lack of knowledge and contacts in that area, and a lot of money available to try
                    different experimental approaches. So, I think at the time, you could go back
                    and find almost any issue that you wanted to raise in retrospect, you could find
                    somebody who had written a paper about that issue. In terms of figuring out the
                    priorities of which issues you worry about most and in terms of the sequencing
                    of which actions you undertook first or take parallel action on several fronts.
                    And, that was experimental.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>Last week you asked me whether or not I thought there had been a change or what
                    the change had been. I more or less said, I never went back and looked. And,
                    that's really not true. I guess I did think about it and it became relevant to
                    other positions that I held later, because, if you look back at it, the one part
                    of it that was probably the most troubled, turbulent, you know, were the
                    emergency programs. The logistical effort to first of all figure out how much
                    aid was needed; where were the food needed; how to get it there; and that if you
                    look at the scope of the emergency program, when Hunter was first running it
                    back in '71, '72, I think he said once that it was like less than ten percent of
                    what they were able to move five or six years later. That is just a major turn
                    around if you think about the actual day-to-day physical problem of getting the
                    food to Africa; to the right port; out of the port and on a railroad; off the
                    railroad onto a truck; just the variety of things that were tried. The first
                    year we were pushing things in. We had a truck convoy. We shipped food to
                    Algiers and put it on a truck and trucked it across the Sahara Desert in order
                    to get to some of the northern sections of the six Sahelian countries.</p>
                <p>There's one set of cables that I wished I had saved. We insisted that these two
                    poor engineers from the Regional Office of Abidjan go check out what we'd heard
                    from another donor was a possible truck route. This was over Thanksgiving. So,
                    they took off up into the Northern regions of Nigeria and Niger, trying to find
                    the road first of all. What they did was every night in camp they'd write a
                    cable and then the cables came in later, of course when I got back home. But,
                    they wrote a cable about the fact that they were trying to track the road by
                    following camel droppings and it was difficult to tell which was sand and which
                    was road. It ended with their celebration of opening cans of Spam on
                    Thanksgiving Day. I think the level of effort that people put out willingly,
                    incredibly tough circumstances, made a difference. But, it made a difference
                    permanently and that there were short-term bottle necks that donors buying 18
                    trucks and shipping the Mac trucks out there, and setting up a maintenance unit
                    so that the mechanics could be trained. It lasted five, six, seven years. And,
                    from that level of short-term input you moved into other more developmental
                    things and the institutional constraints that you're talking about, which I
                    think is probably the most long range of anything that we tried. You may be able
                    to envision a framework for the last 20 years, basically still being short term.
                    I don't think you can tell how much difference it made to have the donors
                    working together and making a major effort.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I don't think so. I don't think you can tell now. I think there were
                    some solid achievements. I think we did increase the number of trained
                    administrators; we put in the education that people would need as they returned
                    to their countries. You have your remarkably high rates of participants
                    returning to their countries. But major capital projects were carried out by
                    people with little information on what was possible from the beginning for the
                    agricultural sector.[revised ed]</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The technical people that we sent out initially did not have a good
                    background. Did not have the foundation of knowing what the countries normal
                    system was. I mean, we were going in without the basic information Essentially,
                    by the time we got the historical data, what the technical people really said
                    was that, the populations because of an unusually high rainfall period from
                    1940s, 1950s, then in 1960s, had pushed farming much farther north than they
                    should have pushed it. It wasn't that the desert was advancing so much, which
                    was the first conclusion that the desert was advancing, you know, six inches a
                    year or something. People had pushed into the desert, because of the high
                    rainfall and had managed to eek out a living. But, in normal rainfall years it
                    was, if anything, livestock territory. It wasn't farming territory. Also there
                    was a lack of any type of an alternative job market for any of the population
                    that had pushed north.</p>
                <p>So, who's the villain; population growth had just expanded far beyond the ability
                    of the land to support people and no alternative employment in exports or
                    semi-manufacturing or light manufacturing had taken its place. Partially, that
                    was because again of the extreme transportation costs, if they were talking
                    about exporting to the international market; there was also the problem: if you
                    wanted to export from Niger to Nigeria, they were both producing the same
                    things. Nigeria really didn't need to go to Niger to buy their products, they
                    could buy them locally, with the major exception of livestock. So, your
                    livestock was really your primary commercial vehicle and yet you had a nomadic
                    pastoral culture which didn't really raise livestock to sell. There had to be a
                    major shift in their thinking to go in that direction. You had historic
                    conflicts between the nomadic pastoral people and the agricultural people, which
                    became complicated essentially by the northern region nomadic people tending to
                    be either animistic, pagans, or Muslim. And, your population centers and farther
                    south, were agricultural settlements and tended to be Christian. You wound up
                    with some very deeply imbedded problems that made it difficult for the two
                    groups to work together. Probably Chad is the best example where your southern
                    political leadership came from a black cotton growing agricultural area and
                    where your drought hit in the northern nomadic, more Arabic-type population
                    area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the policy questions? Were people concerned
                        about economic policies, price policies and things of that sort at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: I would make a distinction. I think they were concerned about
                    international policies; things that restricted the flow of goods for export or
                    for import and were concerned about the foreign exchange types of constraints
                    that the countries faced, which in many ways were tied into the Francophone
                    countries; they had stayed in the CFA Franc zone where they had no independent
                    monetary policy. The monetary policy solely depended upon what the French
                    Government did, and yet the foreign exchange, the fact that the currency was
                    fully convertible to a hard currency, gave them a lot more freedom on the import
                    side and, I think, a lot of the policy effort was an attempt to work with the
                    government, first to figure out just exactly what that meant in terms of being
                    in the CFA zone or in not being in the CFA zone. Secondly, looking at the
                    policies that surrounded very small economies and import-export types of
                    regulations — pricing for crops and/or for internal sales policies as to what
                    you had to pay.</p>
                <p>This is an example from across the continent, but in Kenya the basic impact of
                    donors providing foreign assistance in the form of food aid, resulted in the
                    creation of food boards, which were primarily concerned with distribution and
                    secondarily with employment that there were jobs. The price issue became a far
                    lower priority, because it wasn't seen as a pricing mechanism or a marketing
                    effort, it was a distribution effort. And, the idea was to pay the farmer low
                    prices and sell for low prices and the government would pick up the discrepancy
                    for internal transportation and distribution through government taxes on
                    something. And, they ran out of things to tax.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are you familiar with Eliot Berg's work on prices in the
                        Sahelian countries? Do you remember that or was that was after you
                        left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No, I'm not familiar with that.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Again, you have to remember, my exposure to the Sahel was '71 through
                    '76, and much of the more sophisticated policy effort, I think came after
                    '76.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. Well, any other points you want to make on the
                        Sahel program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: I was thinking, three times in my professional career with USAID, I got
                    involved in moving large amounts of money in an area with a previous low
                    threshold. First, with the Sahel during the early days of building it; secondly,
                    it was in East Africa where we had major efforts in Sudan, Somalia, Uganda;
                    third, was in the Newly Independent States of the Russian federation and the
                    Eastern European independent countries. In all three cases, I think, the
                    attempt, the pressure, in terms of public pressure of people being concerned
                    about the situation, was that you could make money available and you could fix
                    the problem through money. And, everybody, we, Congress, other donors,
                    academics, all solved the problems for those three areas in terms of making
                    large amounts of money available and moving quickly. I think in all three cases
                    we operated under illusion that you could make a change real fast.</p>
                <p>In '74, '76 I was in Cameroon and I worked on a project where at that time you
                    submitted three documents. The first was a PID, a Project Identification
                    Document; then a PRP, Project Review Proposal; and then a final PP, Project
                    Paper. We submitted a PID. The Cameroonians asked the U.S. for help in a
                    livestock health project. We submitted a PID to Washington for a livestock
                    project, but it would be more than animal health. It would be a range management
                    project. It was turned down by Washington. They said, “Redo it.” Instead, we
                    went to the PRP which was also turned down. We did a PP which was turned down,
                    and we did another PP which was turned down. It started as the government and
                    Cameroonians wanted an animal health project. They wanted us to give them some
                    vaccines and help them do all the vaccinations We progressively turned it from
                    animal health to range management, to agriculture and range management, to its
                    final product, a project named was, North Cameroon Integrated Rural Development
                    Agriculture and Livestock. The reason why I'm saying all that is because, it
                    made me realize that the Liberian project sort of evolved like the Cameroon
                    project. I think one of our major mistakes in Africa was that we wound up caring
                    more than the host country did. We wound up having more of ourselves invested in
                    a project approach. In order to make it acceptable to us, we would make it much
                    more complicated and complex in that Monrovia wanted a modern hospital in the
                    capitol city. We turned it into an integrated country health program with
                    primary health care. What we wound up approving and what we said they should do,
                    you know, it was logical, it is sensible, it would be the best overall national
                    health plan, but they wouldn't let them run it. It came around we wound up with
                    that it didn't make sense to animal health, you should do livestock management,
                    or you shouldn't just do range management, you should do agriculture and you
                    should do rural development. It just became more and more complicated as we
                    tried.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did it evolve like that? That's an interesting
                        example. What were the forces that kept rejecting it and then adding more
                        complexity and more components? What was driving that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The easy answer is Washington as opposed to a field perspective. But, I
                    think it was also....</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was Washington running it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Washington, because you had so many groups. You had in microcosm what
                    amounted to lobby groups. People whose entire life had been spent on livestock.
                    And, they knew if you were going to solve a livestock problem this was what
                    their experience in the U.S. plus their international experience said that you
                    should do about it. The agriculturalists were right, that you shouldn't just do
                    a livestock project, you should do agriculture plus livestock and then if you're
                    going to do that, you've got to have integrated rural development, and you know,
                    it all makes sense. It is based upon a lot of lessons learned of why a single
                    intervention project didn't work. Because, a single intervention simply doesn't
                    have enough weight or it doesn't have a mass to act as an catalyst for all the
                    other changes that need to take place. So, by experience, by training, by
                    knowledge, both the field office and Washington kept making it more complex. It
                    ended up with us being more involved than the country. Having more involvement
                    in making the project a success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they were involved in this evolution?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: They participated in it. They were members.. we had five different
                    donors in a multi- donor project. That was the other reason. I'd forgot about
                    that. The original team consisted of some people from Utah, Brigham University,
                    who were the livestock specialists; a water specialist from Ethiopia who was a
                    refugee of the United States but, he was a very good water engineer; two guys
                    from France; and a guy from Belgium, all headed up to North Cameroon and worked
                    on this project. So, some of the complexity of the project related to the fact
                    that different international groups wanted to put a higher priority on one type
                    of approach or another. Part of that was the U.S. portion of the team who
                    happened to be very well grounded scientifically, did not know Africa; did not
                    know French; they had no real feel for how to compromise. So, we had problems
                    from the Americans on the team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your role on this? We're getting ahead of
                        ourselves, but that's okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: When this took place, I was in Cameroon as Deputy Director to John
                    Koehring who was Mission Director.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>There's a separate saga: periodically, in my 30 years with the Agency, I had
                    tried to convert to the Foreign Service on two or three different occasions, and
                    there was always a different reason why I couldn't convert. In that particular
                    '74 to '76, thanks to David Shear and John Koehring, I was in Cameroon for two
                    years on TDY. John essentially had me working as the Deputy Director across the
                    board without distinction in Cameroon, and David Shear gave me assignments on
                    different desks. Whenever he would have a vacancy, you know, on paper I was the
                    Mauritanian desk officer, the Mali desk officer, all variety of jobs I'd never
                    had. Essentially, initially when we did the PID, I wasn't that involved. The
                    agricultural specialists worked on that. Then, when we turned the PID down, John
                    decided rather than redo it — another PID, he would just go to the PRP stage, he
                    sent me up North to North Cameroon with a private team. Lynn Berry was the team
                    leader.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the agricultural officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: He was the agricultural officer and my main mandate from John was to
                    somehow keep the peace between Lynn and the guys from the University—Brigham
                    University of Utah and the two Frenchmen and the others. So, there was a lot of
                    hubbub. A lot of controversy. I went in to Washington with the PRP to defend it
                    and got thoroughly trashed. Sent back to post with instructions to redo it
                    totally. Talked it over with John and John felt that if we were going to redo it
                    we ought to move to the PP stage, so we moved to the PP stage. So, I went in to
                    Washington with the PP and tried to get it approved. In the face of this total
                    appreciation of the structure of doing a PID and PRP without an agreement, the
                    PP was waste of time. We took what we felt were the valued criticisms and
                    incorporated them in the next stage. That's the Washington project paper, a
                    total disaster. No one would support it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were its major issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Major issues were the lack of a policy component, that it represented
                    too much of just, (there's a term used in USAID, a derogatory term) a commodity
                    drop where you really didn't think about what the commodities were going to be
                    used for, you know, it was just a commodity drop. For Washington this project
                    was essentially a technical assistance drop. You had some technical assistance
                    going to this group over here and some to this group over here, and some to this
                    group over here, but there was no overall coherent policy as to what all of
                    these different groups were supposed to work towards or accomplish. The
                    multi-donor concept of it, they felt would wind up with in essence, you know,
                    building a bridge from this shore to that shore, but there would be nothing on
                    the other shore to greet it. There was just too much chance that too many things
                    would go wrong. Like I said, trying to respond to all of the different
                    criticisms, the project had become so complicated in order to have a livestock
                    component.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your feeling about the project? You had a
                        personal involvement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: My opinion about the project is on my tombstone. They're going to put,
                    “this was the project that she designed, 'the North Cameroon Integrated Rural
                    and Agricultural and Livestock project.'"</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Weren't there pressures also at that time about the New
                        Directions Policy, i.e. focusing on the poor majority? Was that a
                        factor?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Didn't really hit that much. But, my feeling was, I remember I called
                    John Koehring up, I was in Washington and I called Koehring up and told him that
                    I thought we just ought to kill the project. That there was no way that the
                    project as written could respond to the criticisms as made, because the
                    criticisms were right. There's a limit to what you can do by redrafting a piece
                    of paper. My example use to be that, the Great Lakes are up here on a map. You
                    can take the map and you can put the Great Lakes down in Arizona and they look
                    nice, but it doesn't change things. The whole picture is still up there, you
                    just rewrote the map. At this point, we were in the position of just rewriting
                    the map and it was just totally out of control, and that we just ought to go
                    ahead and let the project go for that year, step back, rethink what we wanted to
                    do in North Cameroon; John wasn't prepared to do that. And, Howard Helman wasn't
                    prepared to do that. Howard was an USAID officer in Paris at the time and he'd
                    been doing liaison with the French and the Belgians trying to keep that portion
                    of the multi-donor effort on track. So, Howie felt that there was a chance to
                    save the project. What we wound up doing was, Howie and the two Frenchmen and
                    the Belgians and the Ethiopian (Water Engineer, ed) and me, all went out to
                    Utah. We met at Utah for about three weeks. The first step was they had the
                    review of the project paper by the assembled Utah faculty. We had a thorough two
                    day professional review of the paper and then we sat down to rewrite the paper
                    with Howard doing non-stop interpretation of what the Frenchmen would say. Then
                    he'd tell the guys from Utah what the Frenchmen said, then he'd switch back to
                    English and tell them what they said and at the same time shaping the
                    project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were in this meeting too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yeah. We had everybody in this meeting. Myself, and the two Frenchmen,
                    and the guy from Belgium kept running out to the fire escape, because it was a
                    no smoking campus. You were not allowed to smoke in any building. You were
                    supposed to go downstairs and out in the middle of the street. Since there was a
                    snow storm for most of the three weeks we were out there, the university allowed
                    us to go out to the fire escape and smoke.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any Cameroonians there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Nope, there were no Cameroonians there. At this point, the Cameroonians
                    were on an animal health project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you come out after that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Howard did an extraordinary job of pulling together the English and the
                    Anglo-francophone sections, as well as pulling together all of the different
                    desperate pieces, you know, of something that seemed to make sense. So I rewrote
                    the project paper, but Howard was the one that was doing it. I was draftsman
                    more than anything else. Then we took it back out to Cameroon. Howard came down
                    from Paris and we had a couple of people from REDSO, I think,—the USAID regional
                    office in Abidjan— who came and had a meeting with the Cameroonians. The first
                    problem of meeting with the Cameroonians, was the Cameroonians were having a
                    meeting with the Minister of Elevage (livestock), and we had a project review.
                    So, the first part of the process was to get the Cameroonians to broaden out who
                    our counterparts were and then I ended up going back up to North Cameroon,
                    because North Cameroon was essentially a separate political entity almost. And,
                    finally got a project paper that the Cameroonians approved and that Washington
                    approved. As I understand it, from talking with people later, it was difficult
                    to implement and the only part of it that really worked was the animal health
                    project, because we did some training. You had more trained personnel up there
                    in the north. It was a good thing in the long run.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there a lot of components at one time or another and
                        did they work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: They worked as long as we had a technician out there and that we were
                    funding the different things that they were doing. But, it had no lasting impact
                    on North Cameroon as a political entity or as an organization. The way they made
                    decisions is the way they ran things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you said at the start, we wanted it more than they did
                        and we weren't doing what they were interested in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yeah, and I think the same thing was true for the JFK hospital. In order
                    to justify to ourselves doing this hospital, we made it more complicated (with
                    the health posts, ed) and then were surprised when the government of Liberia was
                    interested only in the hospital They had the one piece that they wanted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What if you just did what they wanted, could we have had
                        anything that was useful or effective. So, it was a dilemma wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: But, if we'd just responded to what that government wanted, you would
                    wind up with inappropriate activities. You'd also wind up cutting off, I think
                    what USAID's greatest strength is, this basic concept of people working in one
                    country and moving to another country and having both life experience, as well
                    as more formal lessons learned of what works one place and what works some place
                    else. Ken Sherper (USAID officer) use to argue that USAID never did a project
                    twice, because every project was new, because it had never been done in this
                    country, with these technical advisors, with these host government people. So,
                    it was always new, no matter what you thought you knew about that type of
                    project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You couldn't learn any lessons from before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: He pushed it to the limit. The things you should be aware of, but you
                    can't be, he would argue, or he felt he was arguing, I think against cookie
                    cutter projects. You couldn't say, this project worked in X country, so
                    therefore we can replicate it. You know, we found something that worked and so
                    let's just do it again, again, and again. And that didn't work, because every
                    country is different, every cast of characters from the host government to the
                    local Mission are different. So, our greatest strength is in the fact that you
                    do learn and that people learn as they go from one assignment to another and as
                    you're exposed to different countries, but the history in that country is better
                    than what worked and what didn't work elsewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's good for an example of many things. Was there
                        something else about your experience in your desk assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Zaire and Rwanda more than anywhere else. But, the major focus was
                    really Ghana. That's sort of where I always ended spending most of my time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's come back to that point and learn more detail, but
                        let's fill up the base here by talking about your other assignments that
                        will cover these regions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I went to Cameroon for two years on an extended TDY, temporary
                    assignment. I was at that point trying to convert to the Foreign Service and
                    personnel was taking the position that they could not convert me as a Program
                    Officer until all Program Officers were assigned and, that there was therefore,
                    a need for an extra Program Officer. Thanks to David Shear, who basically
                    supported the effort and Don Brown who supported it and Dr. Adams who supported
                    it, they worked out a system whereby, I went on TDY to Cameroon as Deputy
                    Director to John Koehring.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a Civil Servant?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: As a Civil Servant. In Washington on paper, they would move me around. I
                    was Assistant Director for Program in the Sahel office and on paper for the next
                    two years, I was Mauritania Desk Officer, I was Mali Desk Officer, I was Chad
                    Desk Officer. Shear would handle the paper work so that if he had another
                    vacancy in the office and he knew that the replacement wouldn't arrive for three
                    to six months, on paper I'd be moved to that job. In the meantime, I went to
                    Cameroon on TDY and I was initially for three months, extended to six months,
                    extended to nine months and ended up being two full years out there. Art Fell
                    who was Deputy Director in Cameroon, went on TDY to Senegal; I think Roger
                    Pollen(ph) was in Senegal and went on TDY to REDSO Regional Office in Abidjan,
                    and Roy Stacy went on temporary assignment from Abidjan to Washington and took
                    my old job working for David Shear. Over the two years, everybody else involved
                    in this process was Foreign Service. I was the only Civil Service person. Over
                    the next two years they sort of gradually worked out the paper assignments to
                    the Washington assignments for everyone except me. After two years, they finally
                    said, “Look here, it's over with. You might as well come back, if you want to
                    try again (to get into the Foreign Service) some other day.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Cameroon? This was what
                        year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: '74, '76. Cameroon was a Regional Development Office with responsibility
                    for five countries: Cameroon, Chad, Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, and the Central
                    Africa Republic. The Sahelian side of it in terms of Chad was broken off into an
                    independent office, but increased funds were becoming available for the other
                    countries, not in the same startling magnitude that you had for the Sahel.
                    Previously the program had consisted of regional projects under very broad
                    definitions of what a regional project is. We helped build the Cameroon Railroad
                    from Douala, the port city, up to N'Gaound�r�, to about two-thirds of the way
                    north.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the Trans Cam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: This is the Trans Cam Railroad. On the argument that it was supposed to
                    link to a railroad being built in Chad and it was going to have a regional
                    impact beyond its national borders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The rationale was regional?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: The rationale was regional. Truce (ph) Hospital, which was the major
                    teaching medical school in Cameroon, had scholarships for Chadians, Gaborone,
                    African Republic, and became the first, it was the major, I think it was the
                    first, but if not the first, it was the major training school in Trench (ph).
                    And again, it was entirely built in Cameroon, but because of offering
                    scholarships to the neighboring nations, it qualified as a regional project.
                    Most of what we did fit under that kind of rationale for '74, '76 partially, the
                    rationale of doing the development assistance program for each of the six
                    Sahelian countries. We also did them (regional projects) for the non-Sahelian
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: We did a regional assistance program, a three to five year projected
                    assistance program for Chad, but we also did one for Cameroon, and Gabon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were bilateral programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The decision was to turn them in to bilateral programs. I had been team
                    leader for the DAP (Development Assistance Program) Team that went out to do the
                    original study for the five countries, and then went on out as Deputy Director
                    to Cameroon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the all five?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No, we had five desks. We did five individual programs, assuming that
                    they would have bilateral programs, but that we would try and do it in ways that
                    multiplied the impact on more than one country. It was easier to show as part of
                    an overall regional Sahel program. As a matter of fact, there were three teams
                    that went out: one went to Senegal, Mali, Mauritania; one did Niger and Upper
                    Volta; and our's did Cameroon, Chad, and Central African Republic. When the
                    three teams came back to Washington, we developed an overall regional proposal
                    for the six Sahel countries, which showed how the individual bilateral programs
                    would inter-relate, as well as how we saw the multi-donor, Club du Sahel and the
                    CILSS would operate helping to integrate what was done individually in each of
                    the countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What you were doing were, except for Chad, non-Sahelian
                        development programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: We worked for non-Sahelian programs and essentially set up bilateral
                    programs in each of them with again an idea just, I think because of the
                    environment. It was coming out of finding regional commonalities, projects that
                    you could do that would have some sort of regional underpinning.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, here you were still required to maintain the
                        regional?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No, I wasn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I see, the U.S. team.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yeah, at that point, the Korry report attempt to have a limit of eight
                    or ten bilateral nations was collapsing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how far did you get in trying to preserve this
                        regional cover or umbrella for these programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It didn't work. Well, I know primarily, the difference is between the
                    Sahel program and the countries that Cameroon covered. We didn't call regional
                    meetings in those countries. We didn't call those countries together; there was
                    no political base that held Gabon, Central African Republic and Cameroon
                    together. Cameroon had a special sort of situation and that part of the country
                    was Francophone, part of the country was Anglophone. They probably had weaker
                    ties to Francophone community. Gabon and the Central Africa Republic had much
                    stronger ties, but also had very unique leaderships that were extraordinarily
                    difficult to work with, and Central Africa Republic had the least developed
                    infrastructure of any country that I had ever worked with. They simply had a
                    capitol city and an airport and that was it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there some regional casts to different programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: We had regional people; the Health Officer in Cameroon reported to the
                    Mission Director in Cameroon. He was also the Health Officer for Chad and the
                    one in Chad reported to the Mission Director in Chad. He was also the Health
                    Officer in Gabon, etc. In that case, the Mission Director in Cameroon was still
                    the boss, but they operated like a bilateral country. We worked on a bilateral
                    basis with the Embassies in different countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, there was no USAID people in the countries, was
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Initially, there were no USAID people in the countries at all. Over the
                    two year period we ended up with contractor personnel and PVO personnel, but no
                    direct hire personnel.</p>

                <p>JOHNSON: In all honesty, I'd have to say it varied. We had an extraordinary
                    Health Officer, Al Henn, who managed to maintain a level of energy and a
                    commitment to travel where he would personally be in each of the countries. A
                    great cost to family life of having a wife and two small children, but he took
                    the time and he spent the effort to go to Gabon and stay in Gabon long enough to
                    where he maintained contacts. I think in the Controller, Steve Leapus was the
                    Controller. Steve Leapus did a remarkable job of keeping the accounting straight
                    and providing financial assistance and advice, both to the governments and to
                    the contractors. Again, at high personal costs and a lot of time spent
                    traveling. One of the problems that I don't think anyone really takes in to
                    account. Regional offices involved just an enormous personal penalty in terms of
                    family life and for the children of the person who travels. Plus, going up to
                    the Central Africa Republic was not like visiting the Bahamas, but it got us out
                    of Cameroon. There was an enormous isolation factor for the families that stayed
                    in Yaounde. They got out every two years or every 18 months, whereas we were
                    getting out every six weeks. The process of traveling to another country
                    provided a mental break for us that people who were in country didn't get.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the substantive side of the program, did that
                        work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I don't know whether I'd call Gabon and the Central Africa Republic
                    programs a fair test. On the substantive side, we wound up with, and again like
                    I said, because I saw it in East Africa and I saw it in the newly independent
                    states. I'm probably over-sensitized to what people did just an automatic fall
                    back. You go in to a country where you don't have USAID personnel and you looked
                    to the other donors first. You talk to the host government and you're really
                    sort of unsure as to how much to trust individuals; which ministries have a
                    reputation for being well run; which ministries are total disaster areas you
                    should stay away from; which ministry will give you an honest answer if he says
                    that, “Yes, we intend to follow the IMF report” you know, which is just buying
                    time and he hopes six months down the road that he doesn't have to do it any
                    more. So, what we did was we first of all turned to other donors who had been
                    active, who had personnel in country, and asked them for their assessment of the
                    local environment. That made, I think the U.S. more vulnerable and that we
                    didn't have a chance to form our own assessments. We were constantly going on
                    the basis of second and third hand types of information.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>I guess the automatic answer I've gotten back from other people is what about the
                    Embassy. You had a resident Embassy. Why couldn't you rely upon the local
                    embassy. The local embassy would be two or three people. One of them was a
                    Communicator who did the technical side of it. The Embassies simply weren't that
                    well versed with the kinds of questions, the ideas we were interested in. The
                    Embassies didn't normally meet with and have interaction with the ministries
                    that we wanted to have interaction with, and in many cases, make across the
                    board judgment for the State Department. They went for the short-term impact.
                    They wanted something that was visible, and could careless about whether or not
                    it was there six months later, five years later, what have you. I think if USAID
                    was left alone we would probably do studies to our heart's content for 15 years.
                    And, the Embassy, if left alone, would pass out a check. They got the impact by
                    the announcement of the aid, more so than any impact of what followed after
                    that. In fairness, I think Ambassadors who served in less developed countries
                    became much more sophisticated. You could almost chart it, if it was their first
                    assignment to a LDC, they had this extremely short time frame. Those
                    Ambassadors, Political Officers, Economic Officers who had served in various LDC
                    posts, became much easier to work with as colleagues and it became easier, I
                    think to shape a common goal. What we ran into in the New Independent States was
                    a whole series of Ambassadors down to third and fourth Econ Officers who'd never
                    served in an LDC and had absolutely no previous contact with USAID as an
                    organization, and there was an enormous learning curve. I think what happened in
                    the Sahel was that overtime, (and here again I am bias,) I saw an increase in
                    the professionalism and the competency in the Embassies. I'm not sure they'd
                    appreciate that judgment, but I think that as they worked with USAID, they could
                    begin to see some of the issues they had faced, it was possible to work out
                    professional relationships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any programs that stood out in your mind that
                        worked in that context?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The capital projects were the ones that host governments and the State
                    Department wanted capital projects. It was something concrete, they could
                    understand it, they could see what happened. USAID was interested, I think, in
                    policy change, even that early they were talking about policy changes, IMF
                    agreements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about micro-economic policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Micro-economic policy changes. In the '60s and '70s I don't recall that
                    we were that much into the internal policies or the micro changes, other than as
                    they affected particular institutions that we worked with. The type of policy
                    classic, e.g. the vocational training school in Ghana that required that you
                    pass the London guild and apprentice exam, and that you know how to build a
                    fireplace before you could be certified as a masonry expert. Yes, we tried to
                    change those kinds of policies and tried to free up, a lot of the local
                    governments from policies that were established by the ex-colonial power. They
                    simply hung around year, after year, after year, and no one had ever looked to
                    see, okay, is this still needed, what does it do, what does it contribute. I
                    think we worked on those at the institutional level and the government policy
                    level. We didn't work in the commercial market place. We tended, at least in the
                    early period to stay out of that, and mainly we were working on things that
                    would expand the capacity of the government to provide a service on the
                    assumption being that that was the first stage and sequencing what could be done
                    for development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had mentioned hands-on work? Was that effective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Enormously effective in that the training programs increased the numbers
                    of paramedics, nurses, mid-wives, and even full-fledged medical doctors.
                    Enormously successful in terms of basic campaigns on certain diseases from where
                    you could have a major, well, that was during the period of the small pox
                    campaign of working with a variety of donors, a variety of governments who
                    eradicate small pox. I think it made a major difference in countries'
                    willingness to discuss, and over time their willingness to change some of their
                    planning policies of taking away constraints, if you will. Instead of
                    contraceptives being illegal, contraceptives were legalized. The next step was
                    then to expand the availability of contraceptives so that the people who wanted
                    them could get them, but I think the major impact in the area of family planning
                    was the demographics of what was happening, the demographics of the Sahel in
                    terms of the natural resource base and the ability to sustain the number of
                    people. Al Henn and others worked to get that into the vocabulary of what you
                    discussed with host governments. It was a yearly environmental kind of
                    discussion, again highlighted by the Sahel and what was seen as the
                    desertification of a major section of Africa. You brought those things into the
                    currency of what you talked about and what kinds of problems you looked at, and
                    what you tried to then set up a system that would bring some change. The things
                    that we tried to do to bring a change, they had an affect I would say at the
                    margin. We were still a minor donor, especially outside the Sahel and in the
                    Cameroon area we were a minor donor. You had governments that were, well
                    Cameroon wasn't at that time, but Gabon, Equatorial Guinea, CAR were extremely
                    corrupt. Our major effort I remember in the CAR was working with a vocational
                    training program and that the teachers for vocational training programs would
                    graduate and go out and be on assignment for a year to two years without ever
                    seeing any pay. During that first year or two that they worked, they were
                    totally depending upon their families contributing. You know, all of the people,
                    the parents of the students that they were teaching were contributing. So, you
                    had major impediments. The one thing that we weren't willing to work with at all
                    was how to increase government tax revenues. We stayed away from that one. Some
                    exceptions, I think you had different times and places where someone would try
                    and tackle it, but the whole area of government revenue and tax receipts was
                    seen as so corrupt, and the availability of funds for central governments and
                    various elites was so out of control, in terms of being diverted to personal
                    use. Q: What about the agriculture sector? Were you involved in that?</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: The agricultural sector was always our major effort. In a results
                    oriented framework of today where you could look and say, increase a number of
                    crops produced in a certain area, or increase in marketing surpluses, probably
                    didn't change. Maybe two percent, three percent, you had some changes, but
                    didn't have any major results. You had nothing in Africa that approached a break
                    through in Asia. I think people basically, I know in '84, '85 when Ray Love came
                    in as Deputy Administrator, Ray had served two years in Africa at the Regional
                    Office in Kenya, but his 20 years before that were in the Asia. In many ways,
                    Africa to him was a whole clean slate, it was something that was new. He didn't
                    understand, for example, why Indonesia which was an oil rich country in Asia
                    continued to receive foreign assistance; whereas Nigeria, an oil rich country in
                    Africa was cut off based upon the fact that it had oil revenues and we stopped
                    bilateral assistance. Overall for Africa the difference ranged from that level
                    to some of the countries where he felt that something comparable could be done
                    in Africa. My response was that, well in the case of Nigeria and Indonesia, one
                    of the big differences was that the Nigerians didn't ask for the assistance.
                    They really didn't fight to maintain U.S. assistance, because at that time they
                    were mad at us. They thought they had enough money to go it alone and so that's
                    only one to go. So, your host country attitude towards what a donor could do was
                    very different from Asia and Africa, but the grain revolution. In the grain
                    revolution which involved one crop, rice; one type of crop, irrigated rice; one
                    method of production, the irrigation. It was sort of like it was a standardized
                    production system that when they had a major break through they could then
                    replicate throughout 80s to 90 percent of the country. Down in Africa you had 20
                    major food crops. They ranged from yams to cassava, to sorghum, to millet, to
                    corn, to rice, dry land rice, irrigated rice. You couldn't have a major food
                    break through in one crop, because they didn't have a dependence on one crop.
                    You didn't have the similarity in production techniques, because everybody was
                    adapting to their local environmental area. You didn't have the logistical means
                    of reaching everybody to provide improved seed and fertilizer and to train them
                    how to use these new technologies for a broad variety of people. You didn't have
                    that in Africa. You would have had to go around individually to many centers for
                    many crops.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>So, in agriculture we never really had the break through that USAID trumpeted for
                    Asia. I think what you had in Africa was breakthroughs in many ecosystems, I
                    think is the word, where you would have a particular individual result that was
                    applicable for a particular area, but you never happened to have something that
                    you could then replicate broadly and have a major impact upon everybody. At one
                    point, I think a lot of attention was given to storage systems, because there
                    was the universal estimate that 20 to 30 percent of the crop would be lost in
                    the storage system. To insect infiltration, water damage, whatever reason. So,
                    the people felt if we couldn't get a 20 to 30 percent increase in production, we
                    could have that kind of an impact if we could just save that 20 percent
                    production that gets lost in the storage systems. And, the agriculturalists were
                    very excited about that as a possible approach and break through. The
                    anthropologists spent all their time shooting down the balloons. Again, you had
                    50 different storage systems; representing 50 different ways of going about
                    doing business; representing 50 different mini-climates and that the type of
                    storage system that you could use in northern Niger was not the same system you
                    could use in southern Liberia. Again, if a change was going to come about, it
                    was going to be piece-by-piece type of change. It wasn't going to be this broad
                    sweeping revolutionary change that would have a significant traumatic
                    difference.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Interesting. Well, let's turn to Cameroon. Were there any
                        special dimensions of the program in Cameroon that you were concerned
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The Integrated Agricultural Development Livestock Agriculture
                    Project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Like I said previously, the USAID program in the Cameroon had been
                    concerned with regional organizations or with projects, which would make a
                    regional difference, tended to be in the major capitol in Yaounde. Although,
                    there were some programs that were active over in east Cameroon on the
                    Anglophone area, very small projects. But, the DAP, the Development Assistance
                    Program for Cameroon that was approved, called for a move from the regional
                    programs to bilateral programs. It identified as the major bilateral, major
                    development challenge, if you will, faced by Cameroon over that three to five
                    year period as one of finding ways to connect the economies of north Cameroon
                    and south Cameroon as a mechanism for heading off what could turn in to a Civil
                    War. The strains and tension, at that point, were so heightened, so a number of
                    projects were started with the overall attempt to overcome the differences
                    between northern Cameroon and southern Cameroon.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>With that as background, I think our most successful project was probably
                    agricultural education where the government of Cameroon was interested in
                    replicating essentially the American experience with a four year college that
                    was oriented towards US Land Grant University A and M type of experience,
                    agriculture and mechanical. They saw a need for those skills; they saw a need
                    for the universities to concentrate on that. It was coming at a time when the
                    Cameroonians were trying to move away from the inherited Anglophone and
                    Francophone emphasis upon lawyers and government bureaucrats and, more or less,
                    being the liberal arts type of graduate. In working with the government and with
                    other donors, we had a major effort to try and develop a four year agricultural
                    school that would be located outside of Yaounde, still in the south, we just
                    couldn't get far enough north. But, from the very beginning it would be an
                    attempt to look at agricultural problems for the whole country and look at their
                    livestock problems, as well as agricultural problems. That was probably more
                    successful.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Consortium of American universities, as I recall, SECID: the Southeast
                    Consortium for International Development. It was primarily historically black
                    colleges. They had some difficulties with the contractor team, as always, of
                    finding Americans who had fluent French and could function in academic
                    atmosphere in Cameroon. That was probably the most difficult part of the
                    exercise. Administratively within USAID, it was a point in which they were
                    trying to increase the use of minority college universities and SECID, which was
                    the Southeast Consortium of Historical Black Universities and Colleges, managed
                    to produce with their first six faculty professors. They were all white. None of
                    them worked for any of the SECID universities; they were hired off the street.
                    They had no internal cohesion or collaboration or back-stopping, simply because
                    they didn't have the contacts at any of those SECID universities of being able
                    to call up your buddy and say, hey, I've run in to this problem of grass and
                    forage and what do you know and can you find me some literature. The first
                    contractor team, I think was all pickup people. The second contractor team that
                    had been placed as the tours of duty were up, you had a whole new team. Some of
                    those did come from the universities and that worked much better. But, I would
                    say that is another example where USAID's internal priorities took precedence
                    over the development priorities in countries you were trying to work with. I
                    think the Truce (sp?) Hospital made a major impact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Eye School effective and established?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The Eye School is effective and is still established. Cameroon has not
                    yet had the Civil War. But, politics deteriorated after I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or the hospital?</hi>

                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: The hospital is still in existence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We created the hospital?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, we created CUSS. CUSS was the abbreviated name, the initials for
                    the Cameroon University, something, I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Public Health College?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It still has some scholarships available to other Francophone
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it was from training in public health?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It was training in public health and for medical doctors, an actual
                    medical school. I think there may be one up in Senegal now, but it's still the
                    major Francophone training program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Integrated Livestock project? I guess that
                        was in northern Cameroon, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It was in northern Cameroon. The best thing I can say about the
                    Integrated Agricultural project is that we avoided making some major mistakes
                    that I think would have been environmental disasters. In trying to look at the
                    north and what could be done in the north. What the southern government wanted
                    was a major irrigated project which would have displaced several nomadic groups,
                    probably would have had major health problems associated with the irrigation,
                    which is what we ran in to again and again doing the irrigation projects. That
                    the water would become very saline and very quickly. The salt would then kill
                    the crops and the soil itself would be extra saline and salty. So, even if you
                    tried to wipe out the water and just go back to dry land agriculture you'd
                    damage the land, so that you couldn't do it. In many cases, damaged land to the
                    extent that the herdsmen couldn't use it for livestock forage. We managed to
                    avoid doing some of those so that we didn't, we followed the “Hippocratic” the
                    medical oath, first do no harm. The Integrated Agricultural project worked as
                    long as the donors put in money. After that it fell apart. Again, it worked
                    because it was isolated and suspended from the system around it as long as the
                    donor was there. When the donor left, then it became part of the system and it
                    gradually fell back to its original state.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>The other agricultural part of the project, the primary thoughts for that was the
                    attempt to set up a planning council and help the governor of the north
                    establish a donor assistance planning type of coordination capacity, simply
                    because a number of donors were beginning to get active in northern Cameroon.
                    That, I think, made a marginal improvement. It gave the governor some more
                    trained people to work with. I don't think we made a major dent in the local
                    politics or the types of interest that each party represented, simply because we
                    didn't know enough. We, the donors didn't know enough to even work at that
                    level. We were working at a higher level of a problem that was like three levels
                    above some of the real issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We didn't understand the culture or the environment,
                        physical or human or whatever.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes. Physical, political, ethnic heritage. I think at the level we
                    worked we made a difference, but you then had to dig down two or three more
                    levels for a lasting permanent improvement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about livestock?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, we did the animal health portion that at the beginning they
                    originally asked for. That worked; it worked well. They set up and gave some
                    training; some veterinarians set up some posts, worked out rotation systems, did
                    some education among the herders as to what diseases could be handled that way
                    and what diseases they were better off using traditional methods.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what parts didn't work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Any real attempt to change. Donors were very much at that time concerned
                    with carrying capacity of the land. I think I mentioned before, it was one of
                    the early environmental kinds of concerns. We never managed to resolve our
                    priority for carrying capacity of the land. With the individual herdsman, the
                    priority was the more cattle the better. It was just as simple as that. For
                    years and years and years, the more cattle the better it worked. The more cattle
                    a man had, the more prosperous he was, the better he could handle emergency
                    disasters, family health emergencies, sending kids to school, what have you.
                    There was an attempt to say that you really have to cull your herds and you have
                    to maintain smaller herds. In many ways, it was similar to some of the family
                    planning arguments, that if you had eight to ten children you simply couldn't
                    provide health care and education for all of them. And, the parents said yes,
                    but those kids can go out in the field and work and I can get food. They
                    essentially maintained a traditional approach that you had a limited capacity
                    for cattle within your tribe, based upon your control of five wells and 50 acres
                    around each well. They were very sensitive to the land each well provided. What
                    they wanted donors to do was build more wells, at which point they could
                    increase the number of cows. But, it didn't increase the land capacity and so
                    you kept dealing with different expectations. I don't think we made a dent in
                    their situation.</p>
                <p>So, on the livestock program, one of the few times in my experience where we did
                    look at the marketing issues. We were trying to encourage the Sahelian countries
                    to market more at urban centers at the coast and that was simply that protein
                    was given a high priority; it was a ready market for them. As a relief mechanism
                    or a risk aversion mechanism, that was something that the nomadic tribes, the
                    pastoral groups were very familiar with, which they undertook to do. If you had
                    an emergency need for money you'd sell some cows. If the rains didn't come you'd
                    walk the cows farther south. As a production ethnic, as you raise the cows, you
                    put them in stalls and you force feed them, and you slaughter them, and you have
                    cold trains....</p>
                <p>The same was true for Cameroon, although it was all within one country and so in
                    that sense it should have been easier for southern Cameroon to feed northern
                    Cameroon. Northern Cameroon to feed southern Cameroon open centers in Douala and
                    Yaounde. Unlike many other African countries, the capitol was in Yaounde, which
                    was about half way up. Douala was the port city, commercial center, business;
                    Yaounde was the university and the government. So, both of those represented
                    places where meat was high priority. They flew in meat from France.
                    Conceptually, it seemed that it ought to be easier to do in Cameroon, because it
                    was all within one country. We never made major progress on that then and I
                    don't think in the ten years since that there's been a major change.Q: When you
                    were in Cameroon it was about the time, I believe of the New Directions Policy
                    and push came out, wasn't it? That was in '74, '75, '76?</p>
                <p>JOHNSON: New Directions was Nixon/Ford. So, really the New Directions influenced,
                    I think the thrust of the Sahelian program. You were reaching into the poorest
                    countries; you were reaching out trying to, again with the whole attempt to go
                    to immediate action to change lives.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your understanding of the New Directions push,
                        compared to what was going before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Essentially, as the New Directions, as I understood the politics of it,
                    was a compromise between Nixon and Humphrey (ed?) from the Senate. Whereby,
                    Nixon got the support that he wanted for Vietnam in the military effort in
                    exchange for letting some of the more liberal Congress orientated people beef up
                    the development program and change the development legislation. In changing the
                    development legislation, they wrote it as a modified Peace Corp approach. That
                    individual contact, one on one change was where change really happened and that
                    the U.S. official development program should take on more of the characteristics
                    of the Peace Corp program; that we should move out of capitol cities; we should
                    move into the rural areas; we should have programs that impact immediately upon
                    people; have a very strong PVO approach. It represented a major wrench
                    institutionally for the USAID Agency. The Agency, how do I say this about myself
                    and my colleagues —we were all too intellectual to begin with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Everybody at USAID becomes too intellectual. We spent ages and ages
                    debating the philosophy of the new approaches, and that had congressional
                    staffers, you know,... I would try and explain to them why some part of the
                    legislation was too difficult or made it more difficult than it need be for us
                    to do something. And, they would look at me in total wide eye amazement and say,
                    “Why do you take it so seriously, do what makes sense, use your common sense,
                    don't fall for the legislation.” I explained that maybe the legislative branch,
                    the executive branch had a tendency to have lawyers that said the legislation
                    was important. I think that part of the whole New Directions philosophy was the
                    Congressmen who voted for it didn't really believe in it and they never took it
                    seriously on the Hill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, there was a debate between or at least there was this
                        concept of the difference between the poor majority and the poorest of the
                        poor. What was your understanding of the primary thrust of the
                        conservatives?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Well, at that time I was working with the PL480 programs, technical
                    assistance programs, and capital assistance programs. The PL480 legislation
                    itself, actually invited that phrase, that the food should reach the poorest of
                    the poor. The USAID legislation never actually said those words, but in the food
                    aid program, you're entitled to free distribution or your food for work programs
                    favored poor. Your Title I programs, which were sales programs, almost by
                    definition didn't reach the poorest of the poor, you know, because you didn't
                    have any money to buy. The hours were spent trying to agonize over the official
                    export vehicle that Title I provided which would go maybe to your cities and
                    your elite, but would thereby free up food that might otherwise be compensated
                    and be available to farmers. More subsequent honest or vigorous analysis, you
                    know, really got into the issue of whether donated food, basically disrupts,
                    interrupts, makes more difficult, depresses internal domestic food production,
                    that it's harder for the indigenous farmer to find the market at a fair price
                    for his products when they come in and are directly available at the port and it
                    all goes in to some type of commercial production system. I think the whole food
                    aid debate got much more familiar, I was more in to the food aid debate I guess,
                    than the New Directions and the other areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, when you were in the Cameroon, did you see any
                        evidence of the New Direction? Was it in the type of program you were
                        carrying out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Well, the Sahel program was the push. The Sahel program was very much
                    devised in terms of reaching the poor majority. The whole thrust in back of it
                    growing out of the humanitarian relief effort. It simply pushed us in that
                    direction.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in Cameroon at the time of the Mandara Mountains
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I thought we killed the Mandara program. No. No. I was there when they
                    did some of the original initial studies and essentially killed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It started, but it didn't last.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Al Hoban was the anthropologist who came out and did some initial work
                    on the Mandara Mountains. And, basically his report was so negative that we
                    spent the rest of our time trying to talk the government out of doing what it
                    wanted to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem with that? What was the program? What
                        were the initiatives behind that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: The basic initiative was that you had a large section of land that was
                    currently in this government's viewpoint not used, and you could therefore, put
                    in irrigated agriculture, you could move in farmers, and you could open it up,
                    there was a new frontier's type of argument. (The government wanted to move the
                    indigenous people in the Mandara Mountains out to the low lands, ed) You could
                    open up a whole new geographic area and add it to the productive string, you
                    know, the capital, etc. etc. etc. Al Hoban who was the anthropologist, looked at
                    the area and said, one, it's currently utilized right now, it's just utilized by
                    other people; two, you've got some major physical problems in terms of trying to
                    do irrigation in the area; and three, the area is so isolated from any
                    transportation, logistical support environment, that you're kidding yourself if
                    you think that agricultural production can then be used to come into the major
                    cities. The major thing he did that I think influenced us was the argument that
                    the area is currently used and laying out how it was used and who used it, and
                    gave us some facts to talk to government officials about, who essentially
                    proceeded with it. You know, it didn't phase them. (It's like the early U.S.
                    again. On the initial maps of the U.S. the entire mid west, it's labeled the
                    great American desert.) As far as the people in the capitol city, few of whom
                    had ever been up north in Mandarin mountains; you know, it was unutilized land.
                    The poor majority areas became more known in Washington, it affected the kinds
                    of documents that were written and the kinds of analysis that you undertook. In
                    the field, I think it was perceived or felt as a push to get action going to
                    move away from institutions and capital cities. That you needed to be able to
                    show results at the local level. I think part of that just got so tied in to the
                    idea of moving in to bilateral programs and the starting up of bilateral
                    programs in Central Africa Republic where the rural health project was the major
                    initiative and the major effort. Vocational training was another major program.
                    The nurses mid-wife training in Gabon. The selection of projects and the types
                    of things that were undertaken became as much internalized, I think for people
                    in the field as action projects, rather than institutional projects or policy
                    projects.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, after you left the Cameroon and went back to
                        Washington, what assignment did you pick up that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I went back to work in the Sahel program, for approximately two weeks
                    and David Shear was the one who was trying to recruit me. His analysis was... I
                    think accurate, it was at that point I was so unhappy about not being able to go
                    into the Foreign Service in the field, that I wouldn't have liked anything in
                    Washington. Basically, I felt after working five years on the Sahel, you know, I
                    didn't want to work on it any more. I felt a great deal of it had simply over
                    promised things to the people and that the walls were going to come crashing
                    down and I didn't particularly see that, one, I couldn't help the walls from
                    crashing down, and two, I didn't want to waste my creditability on trying to
                    pretend that they weren't. That was such a negative perspective that I wasn't
                    the right person for the job. So, Steve Klein and Princeton Lyman recruited me
                    to come over into the new organization that was being developed called,
                    Development Resources, DR, a capital projects, technical assistance, projects
                    development oriented office.Q: What was new about it? Why was it new? What was
                    it changing if from?</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Previously, there had been something called the Capital Development
                    Office, which worked with capital projects. Roads, infrastructure, ports,
                    electrical systems, what have you. Then, there were technical assistance
                    personnel under various headings but, essentially all the agricultural, health
                    education personnel,, what have you. And, an office of Public Safety too at one
                    point, and the Desk Officers, which back-stopped individual country programs
                    across the board. Be it, food aid, project aid, capital assistance, technical
                    assistance etc. The feeling was that the New Directions, if you will, the
                    philosophy of New Directions was pushing people more into doing projects and
                    they were projectized activities that were going to be much bigger and more
                    complicated than the technical assistance projects that had tended to be the
                    case in Africa.</p>
                <p>Also, at one point, there was an attempt to differentiate; two capital project
                    offices were set up in the field in Abidjan and Nairobi. The Washington office
                    was considered to be a project development office or a project design office and
                    it didn't handle implementation. That Washington would do the project design and
                    then implementation would be the responsibility of these two capital offices in
                    the field. Over time, the two field offices became multi-dimensional,
                    represented again, technical assistance, capital assistance, food aid
                    specialists. And, the feeling was in Washington that the African Bureau had
                    handicapped itself by having its project officers only look at design and that
                    you needed a much stronger concentration on implementation actions. I think at
                    that time there was perceived to be buildup in pipelines across Africa where
                    projects were getting approved, but then running in to just enormous
                    implementation issues. So, the idea behind the new office was that you have one
                    office doing the resources which would look at technical assistance, project
                    assistance, capital assistance, and food aid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your function?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Initially, when I went there, we had a Director for the office and then
                    you had two Deputy Directors, one who worked with Project Officers and one who
                    worked with the Sector Specialists in the population, health, nutrition,
                    agriculture. And, I was Deputy Director in charge of the agricultural, health,
                    nutrition side of the operation. In my opinion, I was very ineffective. As far
                    as the technicians were concerned, especially the agies, I was the wrong age,
                    the wrong sex, and I was not Foreign Service. You put those three things and
                    three strikes you're out. The internal processes within the office never worked
                    really well and I felt very frustrated because I couldn't get a handle on
                    helping anybody solve those problems and so I asked for an early out. They did,
                    probably within a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What time of period was this from? What months?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: '76 to '77, February to January. It came over two calendar years, but it
                    was probably less than a year total.</p>
                <p>In'76 when Carter was elected, the new people started arriving and my name was
                    floated to the new political appointees and I went off to head up the Office of
                    East Africa, which at that point, the Office of East Africa had been combined
                    with the Office of Southern Africa and then it had been separated and then it
                    had been recombined. Owen Cylke use to say that he was the only man in the
                    history of USAID who got a special award for separating and combining offices.
                    The difference was they were separating them once again and more in recognition,
                    I think of just the span of control that we had too many activities going
                    on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Growth of the programs in both areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Growth of the programs. Also, up until then, the Korry report had a very
                    strict formula for eight bilateral countries and later that was expanded to ten.
                    You had a process of going up to PPC and the Administrator and OMB for approvals
                    of the changes. The regional projects were broken up, but nobody ever really
                    officially set a formula for how it was broken up until'77 when I took over the
                    Office of East Africa and was there for five years. Towards the end of that time
                    period, it became a matter of justifying why you didn't want a bilateral program
                    somewhere. I remember Golar Butcher who was the African Bureau Assistant
                    Administrator, hauling me up in her office and wanting to know why we didn't
                    have an USAID program in the Seychelles and the Comoros.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What area did you cover then? What were the countries
                        under your responsibility?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: I'll give you the whole list: Sudan, Ethiopia, Djibouti, Somalia, Kenya,
                    Tanzania, Uganda, Malawi, Seychelles, and the Comoros. It was a ten country
                    area. It started out that it was essentially a bilateral program in Kenya and
                    one in Tanzania that would start and stop. We kept running into political
                    issues. The Foreign Affairs Minister of Tanzania had the poor judgment to dance
                    in the isles of the United Nations on the day that they voted to recognize Red
                    China instead of Taiwan China as China. We got a phone call the next day from
                    Kissinger saying, cut off the aid to Tanzania. Tanzania, it was just on again,
                    off again, on again, off again. At that time and now, I think most of our
                    implementation issues and policy issues were the fact that we never really
                    stayed long enough. Nobody in the government really thought we would stay around
                    very long. They said, “Okay, relations are fairly good right now, but they
                    probably are going to fall apart again later.” That issue went up and down the
                    whole time I was there. We had a regional East Africa program run from Arusha,
                    which was the headquarters of East Africa Region. Uganda, Kenya and Tanzania,
                    had formed a regional organization headquartered in Arusha that represented an
                    attempt by those three nations to coordinate, especially transportation, but
                    also other area, so we had a regional program in Arusha. We were not in Uganda
                    at that time when I started, because Idi Amin was still in power. And, during
                    the five years that I was working in East Africa, you had Idi Amin get kicked
                    out by Obote and then Obote get kicked by Museveni.</p>
                <p>We did not have a program in Sudan and we started one up. It was a bilateral
                    effort to start up a program in Sudan; the previous bilateral program had been
                    halted due to the assimilation of the American Ambassador and several key
                    staffers, and lack of cooperation from the government of Sudan in doing anything
                    about it. The politics of the situation were such that when we politically came
                    to foreign policy terms with the Sudanese, then they wanted to start up a USAID
                    program. Again, it sounds like, you know, if you have an Embassy then you have a
                    USAID program.</p>
                <p>In Djibouti (which was one of the five parts of the greater Somalia empire) where
                    we did not have a program officer, we started a program, The Somalis had under
                    various colonial regimes felt that their nation, their country of Somalia had
                    been dismembered into five parts. There was the Ethiopian Somaliland, which was
                    the Danakil desert, which was fought over back and forth; there was Djibouti,
                    which the French for years officially titled French Somaliland and then they
                    changed its title when it became obvious that there were problems with that and
                    gave Djibouti independence; Somali itself, under its borders represented an
                    amalgamation of the Italian Somaliland and British Somaliland, and a part of
                    Somali was given at independence to the Kenyans that the Somalis felt belonged
                    with them as part of the Greater Somali. The national flag, it is a five pointed
                    star, represented the five parts of Somaliland. We had ceased assistance in
                    Somali and I'm not sure that I really remember why. I'm not sure why we got
                    kicked out of Somali.</p>

                <p>JOHNSON: They (the State Department) felt that Sudan was more cooperative and
                    working on our side. The situation: One, the country is split in three different
                    political ethnic groups: north Sudan, south Sudan, and west Sudan. Most of the
                    programs were back up again in Sudan and they dealt with trying to overcome the

                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: State/USAID worked together better, I think on Ethiopia better than
                    almost any other time in my career. We had decided on a policy of complete and
                    open information sharing, that whatever got decided it would be decided out in
                    the open. So, he (State Desk Officer) would share the Ambassador's schedule with
                    me and I would share Ed Hogan's (Mission Director) schedule with him and
                    basically, as Ed Hogan would see the Ambassador do such and such and he'd make
                    an appointment to go in right behind him and do such and such; and the
                    Ambassador would see that Hogan would talk to so and so and so. It was the
                    feeling all over town that in most incidences there was a compromise when Ed
                    Hogan won. We had an agreement that we should make another effort to see if we
                    couldn't work out some type of working relationship with the Ethiopian
                    government. Unfortunately, there was also an agreement that the Ambassador was
                    the one who should make that point. It was like having somebody come up at a
                    dance and say, “You don't want to dance, do you?” And, the Ambassador went in
                    and received a very chilly cold reception, and we gradually started closing
                    projects down and we went into our marathon. The legislation said that we
                    shouldn't stop projects in mid-life and it really grew out of capital projects
                    where the idea was, you wouldn't leave a road not completed or a building half
                    standing. We expanded the interpretation to be technical assistance, that if you
                    agreed to fund four years for a participant to go to school, then you shouldn't
                    cut his tuition in half. Ed pushed it farther than I think anybody would let him
                    go, but he got a lot more leeway as we went through the close down phase out
                    period. The same time we were going through the close down phase out for
                    Ethiopia, we were going into building up the program in Somalia, where again we
                    had an exchange of teams. And, we had a USAID team that went out to Somali and
                    talked to the Somalis about a Somali program.</p>

                    whom stayed on their own with their own sources; made a major effort to find
                    jobs for the Ethiopian local staff which were the local hires and placed them in

                    talk to minister B. We had maintained working relationships with the relief and
                    rehab minister who had actually a delegated authority from the Council of
                    Ministers to sign emergency and relief programs without going through the whole
                    process that the development projects had to. So, for about a six month period
                    we tried to take our agricultural and health projects that were geographic that
                    were designed to be the next step up to regular development effort and we tried
                    to retag each of them and put them through the relief minister, because he could
                    then sign them without going through the rest of the government. Actually, I
                    think that precipitated the Ambassador coming in. He felt that was such a greedy
                    act of maintaining assistance when we shouldn't be maintaining assistance; we
                    shouldn't be providing regular assistance because of the expropriation issue.
                    Publicly we shouldn't be providing it because the government was acting in ways
                    contrary to what we wanted it to act and third, if they didn't want our
                    assistance then we shouldn't push it. We wound up closing the program down and
                    bringing everybody home. It took about 18 months, I think before everything was
                    actually closed and finished.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go to Somali now. We cut out of Ethiopia and now
                        we've started up in Somali.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Actually, it wasn't that sequential; both had been happening at the same
                    time. The Somali program was sort of started simultaneously almost with the
                    Sudan program in '78, '79 and we begin to build up there, essentially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a particular reason why we started up again? Was
                        somebody pushing us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I just think it was hearsay more than anything else. The hearsay at the
                    time was that there was a medical doctor who worked at the White House who had
                    longstanding ties with some senior Somali people. He pushed the State
                    Department; based upon his private contacts in Somali that the Somalians were
                    fed up with the Russians and were trying to get the Russians out and would like
                    to be on better terms with the U.S. So, essentially it was quote a “White House
                    initiative”, that sort of filtered through the National Security Council and the
                    State Department. I think first, the Embassy expanded its contacts and started
                    having more discussions and more contacts. Then, USAID was pushed and we sent a
                    team out to Somali to have initial discussions with the government and the
                    Somalis sent a team to Washington to have an initial discussion with us. I've
                    never been so impressed in my life with the Somali team that came in to visit
                    with us; extraordinarily intelligent, talented three man delegation. They
                    probably spoke 15 languages between three people. They knew Italian, they knew
                    Arabic, they knew English, they knew Russian, I mean just clearly at ease
                    functioning in a European western world.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they at the ministerial level?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: They were at the ministerial level. They were all fairly young. They
                    were in their 30s. But, they gave an initial impression of people who had been
                    thoroughly assimilated into the modern world. It was just a problem of bringing
                    the rest of the population with them. I don't think anybody in Somali has been
                    assimilated. They are the most tribal group I've ever run into. In fact, in my
                    definition Ethiopians are extremely arrogant and that if you're not one of them
                    just too bad, you know. Until I ran in to the Somalis. The Somalis are arrogant,
                    more arrogant than the Ethiopians. They are easier to deal with, because their
                    attitude is, well it's not your fault that you're not a Somalis; you don't
                    count. But, they're polite and gracious and gentle about it. They had their
                    first meeting in Washington with Golar Butcher; they had three projects that
                    they wanted us to do based upon things that USAID had previously done in Somalis
                    They wanted us to complete the city sewer systems and they wanted the Somali
                    city water works also.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And in Mogadishu?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: In Mogadishu. They wanted us to repair and expand the port at Kismaayo
                    which the U.S. had originally built under the U.S. Army Core of engineers and
                    which was crumbling, because the mix of sand and cement was vulnerable to salt.
                    Anyway, it was falling apart at the seams and they wanted us to come back and
                    fix Kismaayo. The third was that they wanted to put up an industrial processing
                    plant in the vicinity of Mogadishu.</p>
                <p>Golar laid out for them that New Directions legislation had passed since we had
                    previously been associated with Somali and now the effort was to reach the broad
                    number of people, rather than to do city industrial types of projects. So,
                    Somali said, oh they understood and thanked us very much and went away and came
                    back three days later and they had three new projects they wanted us to do. They
                    wanted us to do a project for the health of the poor majority, which involved
                    fixing the city water works. They wanted us to provide income to small farmers
                    who grew peanuts by providing an industrial processing plant that could take the
                    peanuts and make oil out of them. And, they wanted us to help the small
                    agricultural farmers who were dependent upon the port They completely understood
                    the legislation. I think they probably got a briefing from Congress in the
                    meantime the two days they were gone, because they came back and they had the
                    same three projects wrapped around the New Directions legislation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: We thanked them very much for their interest and we said that we would
                    wait until our team came back from Somalia. It was really simultaneously that we
                    had a team out there and they had a team in here. Our team in Somali was looking
                    at livestock projects. I think we got Public Administration projects, but I'm
                    not really sure. We had an agriculture project with the University and a
                    Research Station. And, again as in Sudan, we had been in Somali before and kept
                    the port at Mogadishu from crumbling. It was hard to find lasting evidence of
                    anything that USAID had done, except for the people. You had people show up who
                    had been trained at the University of Wyoming in livestock and they were working
                    at the agriculture ministry throughout the university. You had people from the
                    University of California. Again and again throughout the government, you had
                    people who had been trained in the United States and it was the most lasting
                    impact of whatever we tried to do out there in the '50s, I guess. Again, you had
                    to start things quickly. There were enough remnants of the USAID programs to
                    where we tried to go back and sort of expand, build on, see what capacity was
                    still was there and then build on that capacity. So, you wound up in health
                    projects, agricultural projects, eventually wound up at Kismaayo port, kicking
                    and screaming and dragging our heels the whole way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Mogadishu water system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: We never did get back to the Mogadishu water system and we never did the
                    oil processing plant. The two rivers in Somali, the Shabelle River and, I can't
                    remember the other one (the Juba ed). The biggest area of contention over
                    projects done and not done was that the Somali's wanted a dam over the Shabelle
                    which would regulate floods and theoretical open up a whole section of the
                    country for irrigation. There were a number of studies that were inconclusive.Q:
                    Did the projects like the health one work?</p>
                <p>JOHNSON: We weren't there long enough to tell. We wound up with the Somalia
                    situation deteriorating and we were out of there in eight years, I think. Two
                    funny stories. Art Buchwald did one of his humorous essays on what was happening
                    in Ethiopia and Somalia, which involved the U.S. pulling out of Ethiopia and
                    going to Somalia, and the Russians pulling out of Somali and going to Ethiopia.
                    At the same time the two countries were engaged in war against each other. The
                    Ethiopians entire Air Force consisted of U.S. planes, which the Russians
                    couldn't provide spare parts for. So, the Russians went to North Vietnam and
                    bought North Vietnam's spare parts that had been left behind when the U.S.
                    pulled out of Vietnam and provided them to the Ethiopians. In the meantime, we
                    were sitting in Somalia and we had exactly the same problem and they had all the
                    Russian equipment and we couldn't provide anything that helped, so we went to
                    the Egyptians and the Egyptians provided Russian equipment that the Russians had
                    left when they pulled out of Egypt.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>I remember reading that column and saying, what's funny about this. This is from
                    just reading a newspaper, because the two countries were so intertwined with
                    each other with a history of being on the other side of the Cold War fight, that
                    it was impossible to walk through that complex without tripping over some law
                    that said, you weren't supposed to be doing what you were doing. That ranged
                    from, there's a section of legislation which says that you cannot give
                    assistance to two countries if the two countries are engaged in aggression
                    against one another. The State Department told me not to worry. The U.S. never
                    signed a convention of 1832, which defined a Russian. So, if push came to shove
                    and anybody wanted to protest, not to protest.</p>
                <p>But, I think the other funny story about the Somalians was, they wound up with a
                    Presidential visit, where the President of Somalia came to the White House and
                    had official meetings with Carter and had one in the afternoon where USAID
                    people were supposed to go over to Blair House and have this long talk with him.
                    There were about 15 people from USAID who went and it was headed up by Maurie
                    Williams, the Deputy Administrator. There was a sort of a horseshoe shaped
                    arrangement with all the Americans sitting one side and Somalis sitting on the
                    other. The question of the Shabelle River dam and why the U.S. wouldn't fund it.
                    So, Maurie Williams tried to give an explanation. He'd been working on all these
                    briefing papers for two weeks about why we shouldn't do it. So, he tried to give
                    an explanation and the President of Somali just wouldn't accept it. So, the end
                    result of it was that Maurie Williams passed it to the guy who was sitting next
                    to him, he passed it to the guy who was sitting next to him, and it ended up
                    with me who was the most junior person in the room at the end of the row and he
                    said, “Miss Johnson, would you like to reply?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what did you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: At that point I looked at Maurie Williams who previously had been trying
                    to offer a compromise of saying well, let's not say we can't do it. Let's just
                    say that the timing is wrong for us to do it and that sometime in the future
                    maybe we'll do it. I had argued in my really strong briefing papers and all the
                    rest of it that this was a misleading signal that was sending us down the wrong
                    path, etc. etc. and Maurie stuck to that. Instead I said, well I don't think the
                    time is right, right now. Fairly quickly after that everybody got up and left.
                    So, all the Americans filed by the Somali side of this horseshoe shaking hands
                    and saying good-bye and, so I ended up at the last of the line as the most
                    junior person there. So, there I was shaking hands with the President while
                    everybody else, every other person had passed by and left me with Somalis who
                    totally surrounded me. They had become convinced that I was the key person. It
                    took me 20 minutes to get out of the Blair House.</p>

                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: The Somalis had correctly identified me as the bottleneck and, if they
                    could convince me, it would be ok.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. So, they didn't buy the, not now, later
                        argument?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes. I had it all. They wanted it now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you come off with them then at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I mumbled everything I could think of under the sun that I had put in to
                    the briefing paper. That the World Bank had done two evaluations, two
                    preliminary project assessments, you know, had come to the conclusion that the
                    proposed dam would not accomplish what they wanted to in terms of agriculture. I
                    quoted every anthropologist that I could come up with, that putting up a dam and
                    controlling water does not increase the amount of water that is available. It
                    seasonally regulates what is available, but you don't get more water. Their
                    problem was that the Shabelle River didn't get enough water. I forget what other
                    argument I made; every argument in the kitchen sink that I could come up
                    with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we ever do anything with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: We ended up doing another World Bank study where the U.S. and the World
                    Bank would together do a feasibility study of what made sense. That drug it out
                    for another two years. I think we did some more feasibility studies for the dam
                    and then wound up, as you know, with the situations and relations deteriorating.
                    The availability of funds was becoming much more of a constraint, so it
                    ended.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back in Somalia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Somalia again; I can't claim that we didn't know Ethiopia. We had had 20
                    years of experience in Ethiopia and I think in Ethiopia the added deterioration
                    and eventually the pulling out of the USAID people just recognized the political
                    reality that we'd supported Haile Selassie for too long and the new Council of
                    Ministers saw us as being bad people, and that the Soviets would provide the
                    goods. But, in Somalia again, we went in and we had too much money to spend
                    fast, we didn't know enough about the country. We wound up antagonizing the
                    State Department because we wanted to do feasibility studies. The quickest thing
                    we could do was to build on what we had done before, whether good, bad or
                    indifferent or if it still made sense, it was within the realm of what we could
                    do, like the agricultural research center. Although, we did the Mogadishu water
                    works. We wound up in Somalia. It's not because they're sophisticated, but
                    they're really settled and they're use to the politics that go on between 16
                    warring clans and the affiliations and the sub-affiliations and the negotiating.
                    It was like throwing us, (you know, the baby in the bed) into this horrendously
                    sophisticated society where we thought it was the other way around. We thought
                    we were sophisticated and that they were the pastoral nomadic tribe. I think
                    they took us to the cleaners, personally. We went back, but we never really
                    understood the internal politics of what was going on in that country.</p>

                        language, one culture, and tribal society, and therefore we didn't have this
                        risk of internal conflicts. Is that a fair statement as to what you
                        understood?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, it was part of my briefing papers. Part of this story was floating
                    around Washington. It was essentially that you did have an ethnically,
                    homogenous group that saw itself as a nation. It was a clan, you know, with
                    clans within a nation, but they did see themselves as a nation. The Somali
                    language not only existed, but previously, about ten years before, they had made
                    a major decision to turn it in to a written language and preserve their heritage
                    and their culture. You just seemed to have so many things going for it that the
                    problems that you would anticipate going into Sudan where the country was just
                    territorially split in so many different ways, the Somalis looked like they
                    really had their act together.</p>
                <p>We also had a fairly sophisticated policy dialogue going on with the Somali
                    government in terms of getting them to change a lot of the policies that they'd
                    adapted during the Russian period. I remember very early in the process, the IMF
                    and the IBRD had teams out in Somalia along with our initial teams for
                    reestablishing relationships. I was along on TDY and I remember having coffee
                    with a guy from the IMF. And, I was full of excitement and energy about what we
                    were pushing on, the different policy issues and he just looked at me. I think
                    he was Italian. He just looked at me with a sort of totally weary look. He said,
                    “Don't you understand?” He said, “It doesn't matter what policy the Somalis
                    adopt. They don't have any institutional capacity to carry any of them out.” I
                    said, “Whoa.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the observation from IMF.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, and it's partly because the IMF brought it up that we did do more
                    institutional development. We had more teams going out looking at the
                    institutional capacity and the strengthening it . I did get involved in a public
                    administration project. I was sort of looking at that side of the equation which
                    because of the whole New Directions for us we hadn't really been involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right, right. Interesting. But, then at that time people
                        were not aware, did not sense the potential for the country breaking apart
                        and the clan warfare; it was not anticipated by anybody.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: We didn't hit any of that. My theory was that it was there but that we
                    simply weren't sophisticated enough to know what was going on. And, that when we
                    went back in the '78, '79 time period, we went in with other donors so that
                    essentially there were enough donor resources flowing to all the different
                    groups that they could be bought off. With an ever increasing pie, you get a
                    larger piece of the pie and so the tensions that were under the surface simply
                    didn't surface.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's a good discussion on Somalia; what were we
                        trying to do in Djibouti?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I was trying to stay out of Djibouti. It was one of the many fights that
                    I lost.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I didn't see that we had any hope for that country. It was just so
                    completely limited in natural resources. It had two roaring clans, the Afars and
                    the Issas, one of which was primarily in Somaliland and one of which was
                    primarily in Ethiopia and so they sort of mirrored in microcosm what was going
                    on in the Ogaden the desert. The French were in there heavy; Djibouti being a
                    sea port, surrounded by lava, sand, and not much else, and that the city
                    survived on the fact that the French were still there and they used it as a
                    watering facility for the French Navy going up and down the Red Sea. I honestly
                    did not see any sense for us to be there; we should just as well leave it to the
                    French. It was a leftover colony.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, why did you come up with a program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: In retrospect, I think it was primarily because we were moving in to
                    this period of New Directions having to defend why you don't have a program. If
                    the country is independent, then the U.S. should be there and USAID should be
                    there.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And if it's a poor country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: And, if it's a poor country, then we ought to help. There's no real
                    political reason not to go in. But, going in and make the French happy. We had
                    other problems with the French in other sections of Africa and by showing them
                    that we were a donor that was willing to helping shoulder the responsibility for
                    what happened in Djibouti, it made relations a little bit easier in other
                    countries where we were trying to get the French to come in to Liberia and
                    help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That kind of quid pro quo going on? Come to Liberia and
                        we'll work on the Djibouti, this sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It was explicitly in conversations within the U.S. government where it
                    was in the frame work for Africa. So, the guys that I talked to in the State
                    Department Africa Bureau, their economic policy planning staff or whatever, came
                    to me. At one point they wanted us to start a program in Angola as a ex-colony,
                    because working in Angola would allow us to make contacts with the Portuguese
                    and learn how the Portuguese did assistance and what the colonial experience was
                    from the Portuguese point of view, so that later when we went into Mozambique we
                    would have experience. Mozambique and Angola are totally different universes.
                    The concept of setting up a foundation in Portugal, I never really did
                    understand that one, but that was part of this whole thing. We would set up a
                    foundation in Portugal that would help the Portuguese deal with the problems of
                    their ex colonies. But, there was a lot of this geopolitical type of discussion
                    over in State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was a factor in Djibouti?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: That was a factor in Djibouti that they saw. They didn't see it as
                    Djibouti, they saw it as part of the continuing dialogue with the French and
                    across the board politics of how we cooperated with other people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that also manifested in the U.S. representation there
                        (in Djibouti) and them having an Embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I think the Embassy itself predated me. It was a really small Embassy.
                    It was like two or three people; I think initially it was a Counselor General
                    and then they upgraded it to an Embassy.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of program could we carry out in a situation
                        like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: We started sending teams out to look at what the government wanted; what
                    did other donors wanted; what could we do. None of the teams, I think really
                    came back with imaginative approaches. Admittedly, it had an extremely limited
                    natural resource base and there wasn't much we could do. But, I was still fairly
                    disappointed that we somehow couldn't hit upon that combination of academics and
                    anthropologists who come up with something that would make a lasting impact. We
                    had some people who looked at doing something with hot soils, the essentially
                    the volcanic active areas. Volcanic area is a tip of the Riff Valley and they
                    had hot soils, you know, steam coming off of hot soils. We had guys who went out
                    and looked at whether you could harness the steam for energy and do anything
                    with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Geothermal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Geothermal types of projects. We had agriculturalists go out and look at
                    whether or not there was some way to introduce barrier dune grass, off the
                    barrier oceans, which seems to survive despite the high salt and the ocean
                    pounding at it. Could that be introduced, you know, and come up with any type of
                    forage for animals. But, that one struck out. We did a big scholarship program.
                    We brought people back to the States to get educated.</p>
                <p>I remember, the one that I thought had the most likely long term contribution...
                    (I guess this is part of telling about the things I failed at, as well as the
                    things where I succeeded.) Djibouti is a natural harbor which is one of the
                    reasons why the French liked it. It's the best harbor up and down the Red Sea
                    Coast. But, it winds up with the two sides of the country or the city being
                    separated by this huge lagoon. The ferry boat that went back and forth from one
                    side to the other sank or collapsed or something, and the government of Djibouti
                    wanted us to provide a ferry boat. The guys out in Djibouti came up with the
                    idea that what they really needed was a World War II landing ship transport
                    where you can just go right up on the land and you flip out the back door and
                    the people can walk off the boat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An LST.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Right, LST. We got involved in the most esoteric program to get a ferry
                    boat for their government, which I was totally against doing. I kept saying,
                    it's illegal, we can't fund it, there's no way to do it, it won't work even if
                    we put it out there, they can't maintain it. But a very energetic Desk Officer
                    and a very energetic USAID Affairs Officer in Djibouti, between the two of them,
                    called up Admiral “Snift” who had a cousin named Admiral “Joe” out in Hawaii. He
                    knew they were surplusing a couple of extra LST's that hadn't been used since
                    World War II, and his cousin Tom knew a master mechanic who worked over here and
                    could put them back into shape. We wound up with the Navy giving us this ship,
                    transporting it across the ocean.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From the Pacific?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: From the Pacific to Djibouti and we paid for the technical assistance
                    for training a maintenance crew that could keep it going, and would you believe
                    got a ferry boat. I had a bet going with the Desk Officer and the USAID Affairs
                    Officer that they'd never be able to put all of the pieces together, because it
                    was such a crazy idea. The Desk Officer had bits and pieces of funding coming in
                    from all sorts of weird places. So, I had a bet going with them that if they
                    could ever show me a photograph of that ferry boat working, I'd take them both
                    out to dinner. The ferry boat lasted for two months. They had a huge hurricane
                    which damaged the port, damaged the ferry boat, they needed parts that were no
                    longer made. They did rig something that worked for awhile, but then they
                    warehoused it and put it up. They should have put it up in the museum. But, it
                    was the most popular thing we ever did in Djibouti.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I recall it was called the “Bac du Paix” and later the
                        Germans built them a ferry boat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Right. Actually, as I recall, I think ours was supposed to be an interim
                    solution anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Interesting, interesting project.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It was a project that didn't fit any of USAID's requirements or
                    regulations. In the old sense, it was a commodity drop and that it didn't fit in
                    to any grand scheme of transportation, or urban employment, or anything else.
                    But, it also probably fit in to the kind of thing I was talking about that
                    Hunter did with the early emergency Humanitarian Program. You know, you buy the
                    18 trucks, you put the trucks in there, and then when t he grain comes on the
                    train you get trucks to load it into. It was an immediate stop-gap kind of
                    thing; made as much sense as anything else we had come up with really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, what else did you do in Djibouti?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Not much. I can't recall anything else. Nobody ever did any energy
                    projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the Geothermal Project?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p>

                    <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Anything else on Djibouti at this point? How about
                        the government? Did you have any sense of what kind of a government it was,
                        the people you worked with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Essentially, it was the French. The French still ran that country. They
                    were shadow advisors in a sense that they were people there to the manage the
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. Did we have a mission out there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: We had an USAID Affairs Office. I think it was a two person office. They
                    struggled almightily to find sensible things to do. And, they were fairly
                    creative; watching the cable traffic and seeing what bits and pieces, things
                    they could volunteer for. From Science and Technology Bureau, and Office of
                    International Training, and Africa Regional projects. There was probably an
                    assortment or a collage of projects. They certainly didn't get any encouragement
                    from me.</p>
                <p>When I started as the Director for the Office of East Africa, our major program
                    was in Kenya. To a secondary degree, the East Africa community operated out of
                    Arusha as a regional program, which had membership of Kenya, Tanzania and
                    Uganda. We were not in Uganda at all, because of Idi Amin and our relations with
                    Tanzania was just a roller coaster.</p>
                <p>They would go up, go down, go up, go down, because the political issues; it's
                    wrong to even call it political contractions. It's just that Tanzania was so
                    vocal about the positions that the non-align countries took, that it frequently
                    became the lightning rod. The U.S. was unhappy about the non-align nations and
                    the Tanzanians became a lightning rod, simply because they were the ones who
                    vocalized it or staked out the position. Tanzania and Kenya were also favorites
                    of the academic community to do comparative research, because they took such
                    different tracks for development and nationhood after independence from the

                <p>So, there were a lot of academic types of studies talking about what choices each
                    country made and how those choices turned out. The one I remember most vividly
                    is in Tanzania, the country made the decision that if you were a civil servant,
                    that was a full time job and you could not do anything else and thereby tried to
                    avoid conflict of interest. In Kenya, they decided that you could be a civil
                    servant and you could also be an entrepreneur, you could be on the Board of
                    various marketing groups. They saw no conflicts of interests between being the
                    head of the Agency that wrote the regulations for marketing of corn and being
                    the head of the Board that ran the marketing of corn, and also owning several
                    storage places where you store corn. The most valid point that I always thought
                    that they made was that when you looked at it, you had private sector strength
                    in Kenya. Whereas, in Tanzania most of your educated Tanzanians went into the
                    Civil Service and never became part of a private enterprise community. So, you
                    just had a more dynamic private sector in Kenya which then carried with it all
                    the problems of conflict of interests, corruption, misuse of influence, and
                    nepotism. Tanzania was more idealistic and tried to keep the two separate, but
                    then it also had the problem of you didn't have any people who saw a future in
                    the private sector, that the future was to go to work for the government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they free of corruption?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I don't know. As far as an outsider could tell. I think we never really
                    knew how much; I think they were free of monetary corruption. I don't think they
                    were free of the family ties, find a job for your nephew who finds a job for
                    your daughter, sort of interlocking directive of people. I think that was a
                    problem in Tanzania. I think on the whole, Tanzania's service and industries
                    worked. After 10 years of working in West Africa and Central West Africa, I went
                    to work on Tanzania and I went out on my first TDY to meet the USAID mission,
                    talk to the government, get a feel for it. I was staying with some friends and
                    the power went out. They called up Tanzania Electrical Company who sent out some
                    people, they fixed the power and we went on our way, like two hours. It was like
                    being in Northern Virginia and calling PEPCO. That really surprised me. I had
                    absolutely no concept that anywhere in Africa did that happen. I was so use to
                    the power going out in West Africa and, well first of all, nobody had a
                    telephone, so you really couldn't call in that you had a problem; and secondly,
                    even if you called in it would be, well we'll get it to you as soon as we can,
                    which could be two or three days. So, I was impressed on my first trip out there
                    that a lot of the Tanzanian institutions worked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be in what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: This would be in '77, '78, somewhere in there. Kenyatta was still in
                    charge in Kenya. Idi Amin was in charge in Uganda, and Julius Nyerere was in
                    charge in Tanzania.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>There's another subject that academic papers were being written on at the time:
                    in the countries where the group that was in control at independence had stayed
                    in control and had developed some continuity of government that regardless where
                    you had placed them on an absolute scale of one to ten, the ones with continuity
                    always scored better than the ones that had had multi-governing elites. Coming
                    from West Africa, Ghana where they had a change every other year for awhile
                    there, I was impressed by the continuity and stability that you had in East
                    Africa. And, that you had not only in terms of the government, but in terms of
                    the USAID missions where you had had an USAID mission there for years that was
                    well trained, with well developed local staff, had good contacts throughout the
                    government and seemed to have a better dialogue going on projects and problem
                    projects. Especially in Tanzania, I got the feeling that the Tanzanians were
                    very much an equal partner in trying to figure out how to make the projects
                    work. We were working with mainly agricultural projects with the combination of
                    farming, extension services, and trying to get better soil practices and more
                    efficient use of the land. Also, working with livestock projects in trying to
                    move the Masai into a marketing system as opposed to the nomadic herding. It
                    didn't succeed by the way. That was another livestock project that didn't quite
                    work out.</p>
                <p>But, you had much more of a commonality of interests between the Embassy and the
                    USAID office and the donors and the Tanzanians in agreeing what problem you were
                    trying to solve. Everybody had a different idea of how you solve it, but they
                    did have agreement on the problems they solved. Tanzania was also a favorite of
                    the Scandinavian countries who felt that Tanzania was one of the few African
                    countries which was sort of a mirror image of some of the idealism of the
                    Scandinavian countries in how they set their economies, how they handled people,
                    and so the Scandinavian donors were very active there.</p>
                <p>Nyerere had initially set off the country on a very strong community
                    villagization track where instead of the profit being a motive that motivated
                    individuals, the community as a whole was the motivation. And, then undertook
                    ten years after his original Arusha Declaration, undertook an analysis of what
                    had worked and what hadn't worked.. That's one of the remarkable development
                    documents, I think in the world, in which there is a frankness of being able to
                    analysis the situation and being honest about, here's where I thought we were
                    going in the original Arusha Declaration. Here's what worked and didn't work and
                    here's how I think we ought to change. I don't think Nyerere ever got as much
                    credit in the donor community as he deserved in terms of being somebody who
                    would work on identifying a common problem and work on the solution.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>I remember one of the things when I was in a meeting with him, I think it was
                    Golar Butcher had come out and had a meeting with him and I sort of tagged
                    along. He got into this discussion of the fact that capitalism and socialism had
                    absolutely nothing to do with whether or not you made a profit. Under both
                    systems your enterprises should make a profit. That, the difference came in how
                    you chose to spend the profit and that in a capitalist system the profit went to
                    individuals, in the socialists system the profit would go to improve health,
                    education, general services. But, in any case you had to make a profit to begin
                    with, because you couldn't get anywhere and so he really did try, I think to
                    make the different institutions work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, there are those who concluded that he had run the
                        economy into the ground and all the institutions became inoperable. Then
                        there came the realization that the villagization policy had turned into a
                        forced resettlement process and therefore, the original motivation and
                        concept was not valid.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Except, that he himself recognized that and the Arusha review revisited
                    the Declaration, you know, well the process. Unlike West Africa where people
                    were settled in villages. East Africa was much more a matter of individual farm
                    holdings. Nyerere wrote at independence, he would do two things.</p>
                <p>One of the first things he wrote at independence was to declare that land could
                    not be held by individuals, so there was no land ownership. People couldn't own
                    their land, because he was afraid that they would sell it off to Europeans or
                    could not be trusted. The reason in back of that, the stated reason was, that he
                    was concerned that if people owned their land they would sell it and it would
                    thus, thereby primarily sell it to expatriates, non-Tanzanians, but would even
                    sell it to rich Tanzanians, thereby in creating a class of rich Tanzanians
                    versus low. Much of what we did in terms of policy studies was trying to get
                    across the point that without some security and ownership you severely damaged
                    your chances of getting farmers to take care of the property. To do all of the
                    things that an equity ownership would lead you to do in making investments in
                    the property, paying attention to the environmental impact of what you did, the
                    range of things that went with land tenure.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>What he also did was decide that people should live in villages. In some cases
                    that became forced relocation, but if people were clustered in villages, it was
                    easier to set up services, education services, health services, whatever,
                    economic services, buying and selling. These would all be little nodes of
                    development, which didn't work out. The villagization process probably had more
                    support in the center of Tanzania, if you will, which is a very semi-arid land,
                    moving out to higher rainfalls in the south and mountains in the north, or
                    moving up to the mountains of the west. So, the people who were served on the
                    periphery of Tanzania had a higher economic standard of life. They had better
                    crops, their cows did better, etc. etc. They saw the least possible reason for
                    moving into these concentrated settlement areas. People in the middle area,
                    which was semi-arid land and was the most poverty stricken part of Tanzania, saw
                    some virtue of moving into the villagization.</p>
                <p>But, in the area we visited, which was nearly ten years after the criticism,
                    Nyerere felt that the villagization had not been a normal part of life, which is
                    how he originally had characterized it. That this was a true African style of
                    living as opposed to an imported western style of living, and he basically said
                    I was wrong. That, we had multi-styles of economic growth in family
                    arrangements, and that trying to move everybody into one system hadn't worked
                    and wouldn't work. The donors, who also came to that conclusion, never gave
                    Nyerere credit for being that open to criticism of what essentially was his
                    idea. And, that in terms of his own leadership, he really and truly did believe
                    that things should work first, and then you'd decide that they wouldn't
                    afterwards. Politically, however, the Tanzanians tended to be among the
                    non-aligned nations, which was seen by the conservative U.S. as being supportive
                    of Russia during the Cold War period. Tanzania, along with Yugoslavia; Tito
                    became a very vocal spokesman for those who felt that the U.S. was doing things
                    wrong. In many cases, I think it drove the political group in the States up the
                    wall, because the so-called non aligned nations seldom, if ever, criticized
                    Russia or what Russia was doing and was always criticizing the U.S. Nyerere's
                    opinion was, that the Russians wouldn't listen to him. Why should I bother
                    telling them what they're doing wrong, that the U.S. basically does listen, it's
                    worthwhile, you know, criticizing.</p>
                <p>Vern Johnson was the Mission Director out there for awhile and he was very
                    concerned, but in agriculture, you simply weren't going to get any major
                    breakthroughs in agriculture until you solved the energy problem. As long as
                    people were limited to producing what they could plant, harvest, with human
                    energy, you faced an absolute limit on how far you can go in the agriculture
                    area. That's why he was interested in livestock projects, as well as
                    agriculture. With using the livestock, it's a way of providing power and energy,
                    you know, of getting plows introduced. The problem in Tanzania was that the
                    preferred genetic breed of cattle was long-legged, thin shouldered cattle, which
                    survived very well in a Tsetse fly infested, semi aired drought zone and you
                    tried to turn those cattle into plow animals, but they simply lacked the stamina
                    and the strength, plus they were using them in an agriculture zone, which
                    usually meant you were using them in a tsetse fly zone. The two went
                    together.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>So, we had a lot of projects. We were looking at animal health, of trying to do
                    animal breeding of seeing whether you could come up with cattle that could serve
                    as farm animals, as opposed to the longer legged survivalist type. If you will,
                    you can contrast it in the States with the Texas long horned cow, which
                    basically walked their way to market and the Hereford cow, which were a beef
                    cattle that walked from the feeding lot to the train to the butcher shop. Two
                    totally different animals with different purposes, if you will. So in Tanzania
                    they were doing some livestock breeding kinds of activities, working with a
                    couple of American PVO's. The idea was that the Americans would donate a calf
                    and help a farmer learn how to raise the calf, provided that the farmer then
                    gave away the first calf that followed after it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it the heifer project?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, the Heifer project. Which again, I think as a capitalization
                    scheme, it made eminent sense; as a practical scheme, it didn't work that well,
                    because of the diseases. We could not get American cows strains acclimated with
                    the kinds of disease resistance that they had without having a full time vet on
                    call, you know, living right next to the heifer.</p>
                <p>We also did some Tanzania Tsetse fly control projects. One of the more exotic
                    projects was an attempt to irradiate flies so that they became sterile, working
                    with ex-ray and uranium and various other assorted high tech kinds of
                    approaches, which essentially the Tanzanians never really understood what we
                    were doing. They would have much preferred that we took that money that we were
                    spending on this high tech approach and help them with vaccinating cows and
                    setting up dips so that you could dip the cows and that kind of thing. Although,
                    we periodically did the program memorandum or the Development Assistance Program
                    or whatever planning document was called, we tried to integrate the Tsetse fly
                    project into the country program. It was really and truly a high tech project
                    that just happened to be in Tanzania and, if it ever worked, Tanzania would
                    benefit from it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it ever work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: I don't think so. I never heard anything more about it after I worked
                    for the East Africa, other than it was frequently used as an example of high
                    tech projects that should not be undertaken. Nyles Brady (USAID Assistant
                    Administrator for Science and Technology Bureau) liked it. He set up a series of
                    projects, which essentially were carrying out research and it really didn't
                    matter which country you were doing it in. There was no built in reason why it
                    should be done there. In Kenya, for example, they were doing a goat project and
                    the Kenyans wanted to do research on high altitude goats, because that's where
                    they had most of their goats and that's where they wanted assistance. Brady kept
                    trying to explain to them that the high altitude goat project was in Peru and
                    that what they got was the low altitude goat project. Again, something that was
                    probably needed, but it really shouldn't have been part of the country program,
                    it just happened to be in country.</p>
                <p>But, the host government really saw it as money being spent in their country. It
                    was part of their USAID package and it should go to their priorities. Trying to
                    explain to any of the people, in West Africa or East Africa, that, if a project
                    is killed, that doesn't mean you get to use the same money for something else.
                    They thought it was just not understandable the way the U.S. allocated funds and
                    the way Congress allocated funds to USAID and USAID allocated funds within that.
                    It was just a totally non-transparent process. Of course, they were concerned
                    about the black box, that everything went in to and came out of and given their
                    own backgrounds, I mean the Kenyans thought that it was probably a matter of who
                    was getting paid off. The Tanzanians were paranoid about it they were sure it
                    was all illogical.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What other program did we have in Tanzania? Health and
                        population?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Had a primary health care project trying to set up a range of rural
                    health posts, primary health care activities. The population program, I don't
                    think was very active, other than as a component of the family planning project.
                    There were agricultural education, as well as the Agricultural Extension
                    projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think there were seed farms at that time. Do you
                        remember that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: I don't really remember the seed farms in Tanzania as much as I remember
                    later in the Sahelian countries that we had set up seed farms. Now Brady again,
                    head of USAID Science and Technology, was just absolutely totally upset, because
                    he didn't feel that we'd had a breakthrough on the research side of seeds that
                    really were worth replicating and multiplying and getting out to people and that
                    more effort should have been put on research in terms of improved seeds, rather
                    than the institutional growth of the seed farms and the seed multiplication
                    unit. Again, it's a classic argument. You set up the delivery system so that if
                    and when you ever have the breakthrough you've got a delivery system that can
                    handle it, or do you put all of your money on a research project which may or
                    may not pay off in terms of impacting on peoples lives.</p>
                <p>The institutions built in the agricultural sector or in the health sector where
                    people wanted to do the small pox eradication campaign, in which the donors made
                    a concerted effort and managed to move in, vaccinate everyone and eradicate
                    small pox and then they moved out. There was no real institutional
                    infrastructure left behind them. They left their cars behind; they used their
                    cars for five years out in the boondocks, and put the saddle back in the
                    government and walked away. The government was like, what do I do with this car,
                    it won't go anywhere. But, you had an impact. You saved peoples lives and to
                    this day the small pox eradication campaign is the first example that comes to
                    peoples minds when they want to write about USAID's successes.</p>
                <p>In terms of immediate benefit, the next thing to be tackled would be measles.
                    Measles needed a wholly different type of delivery system and a cold chain that
                    kept the vaccine at a certain temperature and had all kinds of requirements. So,
                    that you really didn't have a carry over benefit from the small pox campaign to
                    the measles. If you'd picked polio you might have had more of an impact, because
                    of the similarities and how you tackled it. Polio vaccine, I think is also a
                    cold vaccine, isn't it? I don't know. Anyway, as far as I could tell, the small
                    pox campaign in it itself did not create an institutional base that would be
                    empowered or in better shape to work on the other communicable diseases. Under
                    the New Directions philosophy, you had a lot of congressional criticism over
                    efforts that were made to do institutional development, health, education,
                    training of mid-wives, training of nurses, training of doctors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were opposed to all of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: They were opposed to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: One was working with ministries of health to improve the ministry of
                    health's capacity to actually be a ministry. They felt those could go on for 20
                    to 30s years. They were black holes. When asked what they wanted to do, USAID
                    said that we want to improve the ministry of health. Well, where's yours
                    baseline data; where are you starting from; how would you know when you
                    succeeded; are you going to keep on improving for the next 20 years without
                    having any change in the health of the nation. So, they pushed to get out into
                    the field with things that could make an immediate impact on peoples lives. And,
                    a large part of that was in back of the rural health post push that a lot of
                    countries undertook. Also, the recognition that when you went to those countries
                    that had managed to get a statistical unit in their health ministries, the
                    health ministry would wind up doing some type of statistical demographic survey
                    as to what were the major problems, who suffered, where should certain services
                    be located. The real health posts really were needed to handle broken legs,
                    broken arms, you know, very non-technological types of things, but which took
                    training and education on part of the staff. So, we had a major program in rural
                    health. Again, it was something, it worked, as far as I was concerned, because
                    it was something that the government also wanted. It was very much in keeping
                    with a philosophy of trying to get services out to the rural areas. You had some
                    very strong Tanzanians and Americans who worked on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that the time when we had the interest in regional
                        rural development initiatives in Tanzania?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Tanzania took the lead on that. Contrast it with Sudan, where in Sudan
                    the Sudanese almost threw up their hands at the plethora of donor options and
                    choices and working arrangements, and asked each donor to take the lead in a
                    sector. One would take the lead in health; one would take it in transportation;
                    one would take it in irrigated agriculture. On the other hand, the Tanzanians
                    threw up their hands at having so many donors there and having so many kinds of
                    things going on and the difficulty they saw in trying to coordinate it. So, they
                    asked the donors to basically adopt a geographic section of the country to take
                    on rural development in, and they sort of identified the provinces and the types
                    of areas that they wanted us in.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>While I was working on Tanzania and the Mission Directors who were out there, I
                    also would say 90 percent of the staff, felt that that was a mistake. They
                    didn't want to concentrate only on integrated rural development in one section.
                    They felt that their impact had been useful at a national level in working with
                    the Minister of Agriculture and the agricultural institutions and the
                    universities and training schools, that the Ag research needed to be done and
                    the Ag. research project was what senior visitor came to Tanzania to see; they
                    were taken out to the Ag. research unit. By '78, '79, all of the Americans had
                    been pulled out and you had an all Tanzanian staff running the Ag. research unit
                    and running it very well indeed. Periodically, we'd put some local currency
                    proceeds into it. But, officially all donor support had stopped and it had kept
                    going. It had government support; it had the resource base to continue to hire
                    staff, pay staff, carry out its research. Most of the people in the mission felt
                    very strongly that that was the kind of thing we should be doing was, helping to
                    create national institutions which could then survive the donors leaving and
                    carry on for the nation. Trying to do the geographic territory by territory
                    development, might simplify coordination for the Tanzanians, but that it wasn't
                    a very effective development approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But what happened, what did we do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: We tried to do both, as usual. At one point in there, catching Tanzania
                    on the rising aid budget, we started up some area rural development projects in
                    the certain provinces. They had major environmental aspect, as I recall. One of
                    the reasons that the mission had gotten very interested in that particular
                    approach, was you had a geographic area which was suffering from a lot of the
                    problems that the Sahel suffered. The USAID Mission thought that if it could
                    concentrate in that same area or zone, that they could solve problems there
                    building on what was being learned in the Sahelian countries. At the same time,
                    it was an area that was not apt to benefit from a national program, because it
                    was the most poverty stricken area in Tanzania and the national program had a
                    different set of agricultural program priorities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which area was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: That I don't remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think the Arusha region was one region. I know that the
                        central area was also of interest to the USAID Mission..</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, it was the central semi-arid zone area, but I really don't remember
                    the names. The Arusha area was an area that was the outreach aspect for several
                    of the national programs in agriculture and health. And, it benefited from the
                    period when the East Africa regional community was an effective institutional
                    link between the three countries. And, as the three countries more and more went
                    their own way, you had less effective, less capability in the East Africa
                    regional community and eventually we closed it down. In my own opinion they
                    tried to keep it ten years too long.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the Arusha region?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The Arusha, East Africa regional community, which was headquartered in
                    Arusha.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, wouldn't it be a regional project, or just for Arusha
                        too, wouldn't it, or did that come later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I don't remember much about it. I know we were active in Arusha, because
                    a lot of the regional projects were up there and we had contacts up there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, this one was focused on the region, but it must have
                        come after your time.JOHNSON: The regional area development. It would have
                        made sense, because the Tanzanians were very much moving in the direction of
                        asking donors to focus on projects by region.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, our program continued all the time that you were
                        working on Tanzania. Wasn't that where there were disruptions that came from
                        political issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I started working on East Africa when the Carter people came in and
                    Golar Butcher was head of the Africa Bureau; she was very supportive of East
                    Africa and Tanzania. You had some people in the State Department who
                    periodically would get upset, but Golar and the National Security Council
                    basically offered Tanzania protection for the four years Carter was in office.
                    Budget and staffing started being cut when Reagan came in. Again, because
                    Tanzania was seen as a lightning rod. I mean it was the prime example of the
                    type of country which we shouldn't help, because it did not promote
                    entrepreneurs and capitalism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, it was a front line state and therefore, one
                        the administration disapproved of.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Again, for the State people it was important that they were one of the
                    front line nations that helped support, helped organize and maintain pressure on
                    the Republic of South Africa. They also offered sanctuaries to the Mozambique
                    rebels who were fighting the Portuguese. Again, during the Carter four year
                    period that was seen as a positive and when Reagan came in, it was one more
                    check mark on the negative side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during the Reagan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, I was there for two years under Reagan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the program fare in the change of
                        administrations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Sudan and Somalia went up in terms of budget and staff and general
                    priority given to their issues. They were seen as being active in the whole
                    Middle East contexts, more so than in the African contexts. Somalia was also
                    seen as a place where we could, should show that American aid helps, whereas the
                    Russian aid hadn't helped. Tanzania basically started getting cut and it was
                    just whittled away. New projects that were submitted were never approved. One
                    particular rural health project was, Tanzania had started with an integrated
                    agricultural development process, which involved putting the local development
                    group in charge of a considerable amount of money that they could then decide
                    how they wanted to spend it, with the projects being on the level of a self-help
                    kinds of project, 15, 20 thousand dollars. It was run by Development
                    Alternatives. It was seen very much as experimental, both in terms of USAID
                    rules and regulations, as well as experimental and how much authority it gave to
                    the host country, rather than the donor deciding what would and wouldn't be
                    done. The host government would decide and the activities would be small scale,
                    which in terms of USAID, paperwork, accounting procedures is a nightmare, simply
                    because its hard to keep track of every single nickel when you have 30s
                    different pots that nickels are rolling into. It had proven to be extremely
                    popular with the government of Tanzania. They liked the fact that it gave them
                    spending authority over all kinds of little activities that could be done. There
                    was an evaluation of the project. It was an audit really more than an
                    evaluation. It said that you had some real problems with the way the money was
                    being accounted for, where USAID wasn't following its own rules. It's background
                    to the fact that the Mission came in with a major new health initiative and it
                    hit Washington six months after Reagan took over. The health initiative had some
                    substantial components that were set up along lines of the agriculture project,
                    where the government would be in charge of deciding where the health money would
                    go, what kinds of things it would pay for. Again, a 15, 20 thousand dollar cap
                    so that we didn't get into building large hospitals like we did in Liberia. We
                    made a presentation to the technical committees and everyone liked it. In the
                    presentations, Frank Ruddy, who was the new Assistant Administrator for Africa
                    under Reagan, turned it down flat.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his objection?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Frank Ruddy's objection primarily was Tanzania. His objection raised
                    during the meeting was that he had been told that this was a very untested and
                    experimental process and that he had doubts to whether or not we should carry it
                    out. I remember the meeting, vividly. You had about 20 minutes of basic
                    misunderstanding where the health technical people kept trying to say, this
                    isn't an experimental process. What Frank was talking about was the small scale,
                    capital, incremental, small funded, self-help sort of level, plus the audit that
                    existed on the agricultural project, that raise issues. He felt it shouldn't be
                    duplicated as a methodology under the health project. We sort of went from the
                    discussion of the merits of the health project, to the merits of that particular
                    kind of funding arrangement, and that all the things that the audit had turned
                    up happened to be criticisms of USAID. They weren't criticizing the Tanzanian
                    government, which had more than done its part in terms of trying to keep track
                    of the money and where it was going. But, the project was killed. Other new
                    projects that came in faced the same kinds of road blocks. So the program was
                    fairly healthy for two or three years, just as a continuation of the things that
                    were already started, but then gradually began to phase down and phase out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the program in Kenya?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The program in Kenya was a strong program from the very beginning at
                    independence. Kenya had been the center of agricultural marketing for the whole
                    East Africa and had a lot of ex-patriots who stayed and became Kenyan citizens.
                    You had a higher level of transportation infrastructure; you had a higher level
                    of basic education. You had again, all of the things that people felt were
                    needed as a basic foundation that would allow the Kenyans to really hit
                    development and make major strides, But it didn't happen, partly because of
                    local Kenyan politics where you got into so much nepotism and corruption. Partly
                    due to the handicaps on USAID, due to the New Directions legislation that before
                    a foundation or a development program really got built, we were suppose to
                    disburse and be out in the rural communities. And, because we didn't have the
                    infrastructure to where that mattered and because we had layered on top of that
                    a host government — Kenyatta's — which was very much in favor of private
                    enterprise. When it came to the agriculture sector, which we primarily went
                    into, because that's the way the legislation read and we had the most money in
                    agriculture. Kenyatta was not willing to undertake free marketing, so the
                    farmers had to sell at the government price or to the government marketing
                    board. Since the government marketing board seldom offered an incentive price,
                    they either black marketed or just grew enough for subsistence.</p>
                <p>Again, we did a lot in Kenya. We worked with a two year vocational school and
                    that became a four year college. That was very much of an agriculture and
                    mechanics arts college.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this Edgerton College?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Edgerton College, which is having lasting institutional impact and still
                    exists. It still turns out that mid-level manpower that Kenya needed. But, it
                    was not a popular project. Everybody tried to kill it every time it came up for
                    funding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It just seemed fuddy, duddy. There wasn't anything there that the donor
                    had to do. It was something that was in the capacity of Kenya government to
                    carry out without a donor and so why should a donor do it. Donors should pick
                    off those things that are beyond the capacity of the government to do. It should
                    be high tech things, introduction of the new technology, adapting American
                    technology to a new situation. I think it went back to the early days of the
                    USAID where there was a mentality that a donor should pay only for the foreign
                    exchange costs and the host government would pick up all local costs. If a very
                    worthwhile project like Edgerton, okay, we could build the buildings in a sense
                    of brick and mortar approach. But, they were low tech buildings that could be
                    maintained by the Kenyans. The teachers came out of the Kenyan system,
                    everything was working fine and so, what are we doing here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have technical staff there? Did we send people for
                        training and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: We had technical staff there with the new facilities, scholarships and
                    fellowships. We encouraged Kenyans to go into that kind of agricultural set up,
                    as opposed to going into working for the oil marketing board, or the textile
                    marketing board and becoming rich. It was not a popular project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you implied that they really didn't need all of
                        that, so that it could have been done by the Kenyans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Well, we always defeated the argument. We always kept it alive. We kept
                    it going through one more generation or one more phase two. It was interesting,
                    because it was a project that worked. It was a project that met a very strong
                    need and the Kenyan government liked it and the Kenyan government did what they
                    could to support it. But, it wasn't seen as innovative; it wasn't seen as
                    unique. The U.S, as a major donor, should go for the cutting edge kind of
                    program. But, like I said, we always managed to defend it, we finished phase
                    two. In terms of projects, it had a lasting impact. I would put Edgerton College
                    out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What other projects did you observe in Kenya?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: We had a major rural roads project, road infrastructure where the
                    emphasis of the project was on training Kenyans on how to build and maintain
                    rural roads, rather than us just buying bulldozers and going in and putting a
                    road in, which I think worked fairly well. I think maintenance of the roads
                    suffered as the Kenyan government budget got in to trouble, maintenance on the
                    roads was one of the first things that could be cut. But, I think in many ways
                    we succeeded in doing what we sat out to do and did leave behind the capacity
                    which the Kenyan government hadn't had before to put in rural roads that were
                    appropriate to whatever the local engineering situation was.</p>
                <p>We had a major family planning program in Kenya, because at that point, Kenya had
                    the highest population growth rate of any where in Africa. I don't remember if
                    it was in the world or not, but it was like the ideal family size was eight to
                    ten. In order to have eight to ten children who survived, they'd go for 15 or 16
                    and they also had multi-marriages, so they could have one father with three,
                    four or fives wives. You had a very strong cultural biases on having children as
                    proof of your manhood and it added to the family strength and was a good thing
                    as perceived by all your neighbors and peers. One point during the drought, the
                    U.S. put in yellow corn, while the preferred corn in Kenya is white corn. We
                    shipped yellow corn out as part of the emergency feeding program. The Kenyans,
                    well I want to say that the Kenyans started it, but somebody started a rumor
                    that the reason the corn was yellow was because we had infected it with drugs
                    that would cause sterility and so, this was part of our hidden family planning
                    program, that anyone who ate the yellow corn would therefore be sterile and not
                    able to have more children. I think it was the guys, Kenyans who were growing
                    white corn, personally, but it's the kind of rumor that once it got started you
                    could never tell who started it or how far it had gone. But, we did a lot of
                    family planning education activities in conjunction with health activities of
                    trying to approach the problem that with better health families they could come
                    to perceive the merits of having fewer children. Kenya also became, fighting
                    ground is too strong to put it, but it was the area in which the different
                    merits of how you approached family planning were argued very intensely and
                    strongly, because Kenya happened to have such a high birth rate was seen as a
                    problem, and so everyone was in with a solution. The main effort that we made
                    there was in conjunction with health activities. That with improved health would
                    come a recognition of smaller families and spacing of children as opposed to
                    ceasing to have children. The education people who felt that they had
                    statistical proof that the higher the education of the mother, the fewer
                    children she had. That family planning should be approached in the context of
                    education for women and getting more and more girls in to the school system.
                    Essentially, it was four to six years of school that had had an impact, a
                    statistically significant impact, but went up the more years in school they had.
                    But, the basic education, four to six years did have a statistically significant
                    impact.</p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>You also had the people who felt that the best thing we could do for the Kenyans
                    would be to subsidize the sale of condoms and other forms of contraceptives,
                    because you had an unmet need. You had more Kenyans who wanted help in family
                    planning than could be met because of local laws and/or availability of supply.
                    And, that as long as the demand exceeded supply, we were best off just to put
                    our money into just providing the commodities.</p>
                <p>Kenya was a microcosm for the three approaches, for the arguments that were going
                    on about population, demographics, family planning, you know, throughout the
                    Agency and throughout the developing countries. We wound up with doing a little
                    bit of each in Kenya. The idea was to try and maintain some sort of statistical
                    data base. I don't know that that ever happened. I think that there was so many
                    variables involved that they never had the data. Kenya's population growth rate
                    has come down. The program made a major significant impact on the number of
                    children desired and the number of children people had. Statistically, whether
                    or not you could trace that to one of those three approaches, I don't know. I
                    never saw convincing statistics. I think the education people managed to do a
                    better job of selling their statistics in terms of also fitting into other
                    initiatives that the Agency wanted to support for women in development, for
                    human rights meaning equal education for everyone. So, we wound up with a very
                    active program in Kenya in many different sectors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the U.S. political relationship? Didn't we have
                        an Economic Support program (ESF) at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: We had an economic support program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were we doing that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Primarily because of the Navy's use of Mombasa for port visits for
                    various ships that came through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: It wasn't a very big program. Again, Kenya always managed to get big
                    support in a sense of being a favorite of the donors. It was easier to work
                    there; your infrastructure was better; there were a lot of reasons why people
                    thought that development should happen in Kenya, because they didn't have
                    problems that some of the other countries had; but they never managed to get
                    their act together. Essentially, the Kenyan political process did not give
                    priority to development, I guess is the best way to say it. The government had
                    no qualms whatsoever about flim-flaming donors, making commitments to donors
                    that they never intended to live up to or providing inaccurate data to donors in
                    terms of what's the problem. Oh, well that's not a problem, because it's really
                    minor. In fact, if they'd disclosed all the data, it was major. There was a
                    World Bank Consultative Group (multi-donor group) that was probably one of the
                    toughest groups of all the IBRD/CGs that I witnessed. The one in Kenya.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You attended the meeting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, I attended the meeting,</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The issues were primarily macro-economic. They would have a number of
                    sector specific issues. There were a number of areas in which the World Bank was
                    trying to raise funds among the donors. But, the World Bank also felt that
                    unless the government of Kenya managed to solve some of their macro-economic
                    problems, the donor funding for individual projects was simply going to waste.
                    And, they took an extremely tough position with the Kenyan government on their
                    incurring short and long term debt and on the games they played with the
                    exchange rate, and the corruption that interfered with a lot of other policies
                    that were supposed to be happening that weren't happening. I give a lot of
                    credit to the IBRD. They managed raised enough funds. They were seen by the
                    Kenyans as critical to the country's creditability. Among the donors, the Bank
                    did work to try and raise money for things that the Kenyans felt were important.
                    Enough to establish its own credentials while being critical of the Kenyan
                    government. So, they were constantly walking this tight rope between: are you on
                    the donor side or on the host government side, and what does it mean to be on
                    somebody's side or not on somebody's side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that have any impact on policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Short term. You always felt that it did. You always felt that there was
                    just enough progress to warrant hanging in there, that they're going to turn the
                    corner, they're going to do it, And I think that was probably, well this was '77
                    through '81, '82. (Then I ceased working on Kenya; on those two East Africa
                    countries and moved to Africa Development Planning Office.)</p>

                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The impact of population on natural resources; The government was to
                    provide the education, the jobs that would be required if you carried out
                    population projections, agriculture, both working with the Edgerton College in
                    terms of training for Agricultural Extension Agents, working with administrative
                    education in trying to get the Extension Agents to have a story to tell so he
                    (Kenyatta) actually had something he could offer to the people. The rural roads

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did we use the economic support funds for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: We tried to get the government of Kenya to put the brakes on its own
                    monetary policy in order to come up with a structured enough budget that it
                    would reassure donors to then go to a debt rescheduling, which would allow the
                    Kenyans to get out of the position of owing so much money in short and long term
                    debt that they simply didn't have any foreign exchanges to go for anything that
                    was needed. And, the Kenyans tendency to use what foreign exchange they did have
                    for more or less the luxury market things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did we spend it (economic support funds) on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: We spent it mainly on transportation equipment to back up the rural
                    roads program. I don't really recall that the mission was that active in terms
                    of the macro-economic problem. This was a period when the New Directions was
                    insisting that we should leave all of that to the IMF and the IBRD that the U.S.
                    didn't need to worry about that, that we could worry about replicating things
                    that were having impacts upon peoples lives.</p>

                </p>

                <p>In the middle of this time period was when the Tanzanian army started moving
                    against Uganda, the Idi Amin being thrown out and Obote taking over. Their
                    automatic assumption was that we would start up an aid program. It was just
                    inconceivable to them that we wouldn't start one. The question is, whether we
                    would go in with an attempt to reestablish Uganda institutions, which was what
                    most donors, most academics, most people familiar with the scene felt that was
                    the first step. Uganda had had some of the best functioning institutions in
                    Africa and that what we needed to do was go back and put the ministries back
                    together, put the schools back together, etc. etc. And, those who felt that
                    under the New Directions philosophy we should by-pass all of that and go
                    directly to programs that would improve the daily life of people. You had really
                    strong restrictions from the State Department; they didn't want Americans
                    wandering around the country. They didn't want a big USAID office, in fact, they
                    didn't want an USAID office at all. They didn't understand why the Regional
                    Office in Nairobi couldn't handle Uganda by flying up periodically. The USAID
                    initially sent in one person and sent in a second person, a third person and it
                    was like pulling teeth to get each one approved to go in. Part of the trouble in
                    terms of putting American people in was that it was an extremely high crime
                    area. (Craig Buck was our Acting USAID Affairs Officer.) We've got people out
                    there who became a Mission Director. Craig lost three to four cars where people
                    would just set up a road block and then when somebody stopped they would steal a
                    car. And, our State instructions were don't argue with them. They think guns and
                    bullets, you don't. If they want the car, get out of the car and let them have
                    it. He lost three cars, you know, a brand new, land rover; a Toyota that we were
                    shipping in. So, finally he went down to Nairobi to pick up his fourth car and
                    he parked it in the parking lot in Nairobi and then it was stolen from the
                    parking lot in Nairobi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All the cars?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: All these cars were going to Eastern Zaire which must be one huge
                    parking lot. But, at that point, Craig again gave up and he took from the REDSO
                    Office in Nairobi a ten year old van, beat up, grungy looking, and so he just
                    swapped it for another land rover he had ordered. REDSO would get the land rover
                    when it came and, in the meantime, he took the old, red beat up Capella on the
                    assumption that no one would want a car that was that old. It turned out he was
                    right; he never lost it that way. But, we had major staffing problems of getting
                    people to go out. At one point, Craig had been down in Nairobi talking with the
                    REDSO Office, caught a little plane to go back up to Kampala. Out at the airport
                    as he was getting on the plane, he saw all these Embassy people getting off the
                    plane. Well, that's unusual for somebody to come down, but other than that he
                    got on a plane and went to Kampala and he got to Kampala and they said, “what
                    are you doing here, we evacuated our personnel.” I think again, we partially
                    used the same system we used in the Sahel when we went initially for some relief
                    and rehab type project to get things up and running that were clearly within the
                    capacity of the government, etc. They very much wanted us to help with Makerere
                    University, which had been the outstanding college of East Africa. We did get
                    involved later, but at least initially during those early days, there was just
                    too many things that we couldn't figure out how to overcome.</p>
                <p>First, technical assistance in terms of the people we provided; secondly,
                    staffing on the Ugandan side. I mean there's an assumption that the educated
                    Ugandan class had been wiped out, and to a remarkable degree they hadn't been.
                    They'd gone into hiding, but as the situation stabilized they started coming out
                    from the boondocks where they'd been on Uncle Joe's third wife's farm. And, to
                    some extent they had been refugees throughout the world and they returned home.
                    We had more of an educated class to work with than we thought in our original
                    planning documents.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>The most effective program, I think during the early days was a project worked
                    out by the people at REDSO, where we had imported steel. We had a Commodity
                    Import Program, ESF. It was tied in to polices about what the government did in
                    terms of establishing a foreign exchange policy and re-instituting monetary
                    control. Primarily, REDSO was worried about the tendency for everything to be
                    stolen. Anything that came in, in terms of small portable objects, developed
                    legs and walked off. But, if we brought in this huge quantity of steel, we could
                    be reasonably assured that the steel would get from Nairobi to Uganda to the
                    processing plant. At the processing plant it was turned in to agricultural
                    implements, small hand tools, which unfortunately also included machetes, which
                    were one of the chief weapons of the law and order fight.</p>
                <p>Pat Fleuret who was at REDSO at that time, went up to Uganda, worked with a
                    series of farmers coops that had managed to survive Idi Amin. They hadn't done
                    very much, but the structure was still there. And, if you said, is there a coop
                    in town, they'd say, yeah, yeah, Sam's in charge of it. So, we worked with the
                    coop structure on a distribution system that the coops would receive the
                    implements directly at the factory. That meant that there was less than a chance
                    of the implements going into a merchandising chain where they'd be pulled off
                    for other uses. That worked real well. We did it for about three or four years.
                    Now when I think of it again, I give full credit to the REDSO people for
                    devising it. It was very responsive to the situation and it helped us do what
                    the New Directions were pushing in terms of getting out to people. So, it worked
                    really well. Actually, before we leave East Africa as a whole, I guess I'd like
                    to comment on REDSO. It's a Regional Office in Nairobi, made up of a combination
                    of private sector officers, anthropologists, engineers, and other
                    specialists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sector specialists?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Some Sector Specialists, they had a Senior Agie; they had a Senior
                    Environmentalist, Anthropologists, no problems. No mission had anthropologists.
                    So, they'd ask for the anthropologists to come, you didn't step on anybody's
                    feet, you didn't have to worry about him giving any one recommendation headed
                    east, while the local guy gave one and headed west. Agies, if we had a program
                    at all, we'd have an agie in the country. It was a more diplomatically,
                    difficult to call in the Senior Agie to serve as backup and support for your
                    agriculture program, because the local guy didn't like anybody looking over his
                    shoulder, etc. etc. etc. As a whole, the REDSO Staff were extremely good, and
                    from my point of view, as Director of East Africa, there wasn't absolutely no
                    substitute for excess staff capacity which could be called on to lend a hand in
                    Sudan. We couldn't get our people into Sudan and they filled in the gap. When in
                    Somali, they filled in until we could get people there. In Uganda they stayed
                    with us. Even while the situation was so bad and the State Department didn't
                    want to allow Americans into the country, they would allow the REDSO people to
                    travel in and out. They had full time jobs. They had to justify their existence
                    in terms of budget, OE and staffing, on the basis of existing programs and what
                    they did. But, they always managed to have an excess capacity that we could pull
                    on as we started up programs, just one after the other.</p>
                <p>The USAID Personnel System was so slow in responding and the State Department was
                    such an incredible bottleneck; to this day I don't think they really understand
                    why you need USAID people to run an aid program. They honestly believe that you
                    don't need anybody or that you can do it with Embassy people. Later in my life,
                    when I worked on Eastern Europe and Russia, it was the most difficult. At least
                    in Africa and Asia, you could work with Ambassadors and they — Embassy or Econ
                    Officers — would gradually learn what USAID people do by being in a country with
                    USAID. So, by the time two or three rotations passed, they were much easier to
                    work with. As the people who'd never worked with USAID before and when they had
                    had no experience with aid, they honestly saw no need to have anybody there.
                    And, that's what you faced in Sudan, because they had no aid program ongoing, so
                    the Embassy didn't understand why we needed to start one. Not a program but we
                    needed to start a program. They didn't understand why we needed to start USAID
                    staff or have USAID people in country in order to do it. Same was true in Somali
                    and Uganda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good, okay. That's a good wrap up on that part of it. You
                        left there in what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It was '82 I think. Basically, I was having fun. I always thought it was
                    a job of a lifetime that you couldn't ask for a more interesting cast of
                    characters to work with and had no intentions whatsoever of leaving it. So, I
                    did try to go in to the Foreign Service and once again got turned down.. But,
                    basically I liked East Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The program grew a lot during that time you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: The program grew exceedingly. Not only in terms of added countries, but
                    the country levels went up. We had a East Africa contingency fund in Ethiopia
                    where we carried 23 million dollars for Ethiopian projects that the government
                    would never sign and we never started them, so I would reprogram it to my other
                    countries. Why Africa DP ever let me do it, I don't know, but I use to call it
                    my contingency fund. I kept telling him look, if Ethiopia, Somali will come
                    across and Uganda will come across, we will have a need for it. We were running
                    fairly complicated programs in ESF (Supporting Assistance), which was working on
                    some macro economic problems, although generally, Congress was trying to get us
                    to stay away from that and to work with the IMF, let the IMF or IBRD were handle
                    it. Capital projects, technical assistance projects, relief and rehab projects.
                    Congress set up short term relief and rehab funding category, which said, not
                    withstanding any other provision of law, you can use as a means of trying to
                    work on the Somali/ Ethiopia, Ogaden Desert dispute that was going on. We were
                    making the argument, again that we made in Sahel, that it was not a case of
                    political refugees; it was not a case of natural disaster that started and
                    stopped like a tidal wave or a volcano. The one we had was an environmental
                    disaster, complicated by Civil War, what amounted to Civil War, although it was
                    between two countries, and that none of the funding categories that then
                    existed, really let us do what we wanted to do, and so Congress came across with
                    a special legislation that let us work on that part of Africa. We probably still
                    saw it in too short of a time frame, given later events.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This came after you left though? On the Horn of Africa
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No. We had a Horn of Africa program that died and then they, that's what
                    I was saying, that we probably stopped it too soon in light of the fact that in
                    '93, '94, they started up a Horn of Africa program again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the objective of the initial Horn of Africa
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Initially, the Africa Relief Program really related to the Ugandan
                    warfare and the fact of what was going on in cross border problems with the
                    Somalians fighting the Ethiopians and the refugees coming out of the Ugandan.
                    Some of the refugees went to Kenya, some went to Sudan, some went to Djibouti.
                    It was just a mishmash of where you had very poor facilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Otherwise refugee programming?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: It was refugee programming, but it was not official; previously refugee
                    programming was handled by the State Department and they ran official refugee
                    programs. They didn't do, I mean you had UNHCR (?) that had a camp and that ran
                    a camp. We argued that what you needed in the whole Horn of Africa was ways to
                    actually relocate people and start them off in an agricultural self-sufficient
                    substance basis. You didn't need the typical State Department VISA, political
                    refugee team of effort, nor UNDP type of UN Humanitarian Relief where you kept
                    everybody encamped. So, they set up a separate fund that let us do a lot of
                    agricultural resettlement activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In various countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: In various countries across borders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What scale are we talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I think we're talking about 50s million dollars.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many refugees?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Then it went up to one hundred million dollars. I don't remember the
                    number of refugees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the number was in all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I don't know, we never had a good count, tell you the truth. The problem
                    was, that everything was so mixed together. What we were trying to do was to
                    relocate the refugees into agricultural areas, making sure that refugees got
                    permission to resettle on the land, which was fairly easy, given the fact that
                    now the governments were talking to each other. They were fairly relaxed about
                    letting agriculture settlement areas be established. We provided seeds so that
                    they could plant; small scale implements to have something to plant with; worked
                    on a couple of crop production activities, so they could managed to get beyond
                    subsistence where a marketing system would make sense. But, we were just working
                    to make them self-sufficient.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the year for this activity?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: '78 to '80s. You know, at best it was 20-20 hindsight, which actually
                    was 20-24 foresight, Princeton Lyman argued that we ought to set up a Horn of
                    African development plan. He tried to promote a ten year billion dollar effort
                    for a development plan, which would pull the Ethiopians and the Somalis and the
                    Kenyans in together. He never really got a hearing, so I don't know, about
                    giving it another try now. In retrospect if you had started earlier, you might
                    have avoided some of the greater Horn of Africa problems with the initiatives
                    that people are working on today. And again, you may not. But, so much of the
                    politics in that area were things we didn't pay enough attention to. We went
                    back into Sudan. We pulled out all of the old aid projects papers from the Annex
                    in St. Louis; we had them shipped in; we contacted all of the old USAID officers
                    that we could find that use to work in the Sudan and had them go out to on TDY
                    and help get things started. In Somali we did the same with the old aid program.
                    We also pulled in the Peace Corp volunteers who turned out to be extremely
                    active coherent group that wanted to get involved, wanted to help Somalia, and
                    so we used them a lot. In Uganda, we used the USAID employees, volunteers, and
                    Ugandans who flooded the country, and pulled them in. In spite of that, I don't
                    think we knew enough about the countries. We just simply didn't have the depth
                    of knowledge which could have been used in selecting or tweaking, you know,
                    let's not worry about this problem right now, because we really ought to worry
                    about this other problem, because these issues are going to hit ten years down
                    the road and we really need to be ready for them. We didn't deal in this skill;
                    we didn't even think in those terms, except for isolated people like Princeton
                    Lyman, you really did try.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other donors interested at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No. Princeton tried to get the Bank interested in it to be the
                    coordinator and could work with the Ethiopians where the U.S. might not have
                    been able. At that point, the Bank and Ethiopians weren't getting along either.
                    Again, at the technocratic level people were getting into Ethiopia and the
                    government people that talked the same language, but when they got to the
                    political level, it was just a total wall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Very good. Let's move on to your role in DP after
                        you left East Africa; what time was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Probably about '82, I think was when I moved. Reagan was elected in
                    '80s. When was the Reagan election, '80s. Carter was '76 through '80s and then
                    Reagan was elected and came in '81. In '81 and '82 I was in East Africa. Frank
                    Ruddy had taken over as head of the Africa Bureau. He wanted to reorganize the
                    bureau and he came up with the idea of having three Deputy Administrators. One,
                    who would be the Senior Deputy and who would handle the central staff offices,
                    like DP, Development Resources (DR), and the Executive Management Services; then
                    a Deputy for East Africa; and a Deputy for West Africa. I yelled my head off
                    that that was a bad system and it wasn't going to work, and I didn't like, etc.
                    etc. etc. and got absolutely nowhere, other than Ruddy (people felt strongly
                    about Frank Ruddy and he eventually ended up being fired by McPherson.) But,
                    mostly he was extremely decent toward me. We connected, one day I followed his
                    car into the State Department basement parking lot and it was this old family
                    station wagon and had this huge bumper sticker, saying “nuke the whales.”
                    Whereas, everybody else's bumper sticker said, “save the whales.” I have to say
                    he had a sense of humor and I could work with anybody who had a sense of
                    humor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was also a fellow Texan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, he was also a fellow Texan. One of our very first conversations
                    that we had was, he called me in to his front office and said that he had been
                    at the White House during the Nixon years. He had been Coordinator of Public
                    Information or something. He worked with USIA and Voice of America and things
                    like that. He had not gotten involved in Watergate, but he had seen how easily
                    people did get sucked into that whole system, both of what happened originally
                    and the cover up afterwards. And, that he felt very strongly that career people
                    should not be asked to participate in political shenanigans. He wanted me to
                    know that if I ever felt that something like that was happening, to come talk to
                    him immediately about it and that it wouldn't in no way effect my standing with
                    him and he would make sure that I didn't get sucked into something that I
                    shouldn't get sucked into. I never quite figured out what he had in mind in
                    terms of shenanigans, because I always felt that I worked for an honest
                    organization. I mean, as a cultural thing. There were occasions where something
                    would happen, but you felt like you worked in an honest organization and people
                    were straight forward. But, I remember Frank being very worried about the fact
                    that he didn't want to see career people get caught up in political shenanigans.
                    He was most conservative. Of all the bosses I've ever worked for he was the most
                    conservative. During the two years that I was in East Africa when he was in
                    charge, we had an mounting drought problem. We already had pulled out of
                    Ethiopia in our bilateral relations under Golar Butcher, but we had a mounting
                    emergency in Ethiopia and feeding program and Frank found a reason to keep
                    turning them down. Every time the Pl 480 people would send something over
                    entitled emergency feeding, he'd turn them down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Because, he asked questions that people couldn't give him a hundred
                    percent assurance. Would the food reach the people who truly needed it, or would
                    it go to the military. Would the military rip it off as it came in the port.
                    Yeah, sometimes it did. There was a constant day to day fight to make sure that
                    the food got to starving needy people. We couldn't guarantee it and we basically
                    pushed. If we couldn't guarantee it getting through, then we shouldn't provide
                    it. An underlying view was that Ethiopia brought it on itself, it's own failed
                    agricultural policies and it should suffer from the policies that are failing.
                    There was an extraordinary reaction from the private volunteer organization
                    community.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ethiopia was in the communist camp?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Oh at that point, yeah, totally. Their policies had failed and it was
                    very much in the Soviet camp in terms of Cold War clients. So the Soviets should
                    supply its clients aid. Major letter writing grass roots organizational effort
                    by American and Private Volunteer Organizations, led to the to the turn around
                    and we ended up with a fairly large disaster relief program going both into
                    Ethiopia proper and going into the Sudan and across the border in to Uganda
                    .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What other evidence was there of the conservative policy,
                        at that time, with the Reagan Administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Reagan was very much of an ideologue you know, testing should we or
                    should we not do something. The first litmus test would be ideological. Either
                    it's a country that the U.S. had a partnership with. Be it a military
                    partnership, be it a sound voting partner in the U.N., good relations with the
                    American business community. What was the reason why we were helping the
                    country. I think I mentioned during Carter years when Golar Butcher was in
                    charge of the Bureau, you made a case as to why you shouldn't assist the
                    country; we served Sudan, Somali, Uganda, Djibouti. We also started up programs
                    in Seychelles, Comoros, and Reunion, Mauritius, for the four Indian Ocean
                    Islands. It was: “prove why you are not there.” Make a case that the government
                    is so corrupt that you can't work with it, there's no hope, but you can't cut an
                    avenue around the government and work through a PVO, what have you.</p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>When Frank came in, it was much more of make a case as to why we are there. He
                    was much harder on: we should be helping fewer countries and we should help
                    those countries that help the U.S., be it they help the U.S. through commercial
                    activities and U.S. business types, or they help the U.S. in military
                    agreements, military support, what have you. The Tanzania budget started going
                    down all of a sudden. Seychelles and Comoros, I think wound up with a one
                    million dollar ESF Assistance Program, primarily because Princeton Lyman was
                    over in the State Department at that point and he managed to shave off a million
                    here and a million there for the islands. Sudan became a far greater candidate
                    for military assistance than for economic development assistance. Ethiopia,
                    other than the emergency food programs, we simply didn't work there. I think,
                    Frank did an ideological test, first, as to whether we should be there in terms
                    of what policies the host government was following. He did a U.S. friends and
                    allies type of test as to our overall political relationship; and he did a third
                    test as to what the government was doing to help itself and then what should the
                    U.S. do or could do. The consequence: he was much tougher on asking about
                    project effectiveness, yeah. Can you guarantee that this project will work? No,
                    no guarantees. We wound up doing a lot more through PVOs and Non-Governmental
                    Organizations in order to avoid going through government channels which he felt
                    was a mistake and we shouldn't do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your view about all of that since you were in
                        Africa Development Planning Office (DP) where a lot of that had to be built
                        into program decisions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I asked, after Frank made the decision that he wanted to have three
                    Deputies and split East Africa and West Africa, to consider me for the DP job,
                    because I really didn't want to work under that kind of bifurcated arrangement.
                    He said, sure and he moved me up to DP. Africa DP had two or three economists at
                    that time with John Wilhelm being the chief economist. John was very much a
                    classical economist. If you get the economic policies right, everything else
                    will fall in place, and we couldn't been happier than writing speeches and
                    position papers for Ruddy. Elliott Berg has just come out with his major study
                    for the World Bank, showing that the African countries had simply declined since
                    independence, even in terms of their primary commodity crops. They'd gotten less
                    value out of them than ten years before and he was making a major push for
                    private sector capitalism, entrepreneurship in Africa. And, Wilhelm very much
                    agreed with that and we was more than happy to write position papers and
                    briefing papers and any kind of staff economic work. But, the worst countries,
                    the U.S. should pull out of with that as our litmus test for countries. When
                    Frank would go to New York or to a Consultative Group for a speech, he'd write
                    very hard hitting, you know, the private sector is the answer.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>In the meantime, the Sector Chiefs down in Development Resources for agriculture,
                    health, nutrition, population, were writing sector base speeches. Whenever Frank
                    had to go to an agricultural meeting, the agies would write him a speech, which
                    was all on government services and extension services and education. He had two
                    different policies being carried out in the Bureau. If you looked at the
                    speeches written by Wilhelm, from an economist point of view, and the speeches
                    written out of DR, from a technical sector specialist, reflecting what programs
                    we were doing. So, I felt that my first job in DP was to try and get some
                    coherence so that you had a policy that everybody in the African Bureau knew who
                    you were following and where the money went, the money decisions reflected the
                    policy decisions. This was the first two years I was in DP.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were head of DP weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I was head of Africa DP. I was an Office Director. During that same two
                    year term period, McPherson who was the new Administrator for USAID, wanted each
                    of the Regional Bureaus to write a strategy for the whole Bureau. We had two
                    initial attempts, or two initial drafts, one produced by the sector people,
                    which went that way, and one produced by Wilhelm, which went that way, and so I
                    flunked the first test of delegation of authority as a new Office Director. So,
                    I spent a considerable amount of personal time writing a strategic plan for
                    Africa. Instead of saying this is what we will do, I turned it around and said,
                    here are the ten questions that will have to be answered or addressed in the
                    next ten years in Africa. Here are the ten trends of things that happened that
                    host governments and donors need to be able to have a handle on. And, do that
                    without trying to pre-judge which of those ten would be more important in any
                    given country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What are the ten?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Population and environment were two of the big ones. Political disputes
                    over borders, which had been an issue since independence, although everyone
                    agreed that the colonial border lines were totally arbitrary and bore no radical
                    resemblance either to African history or ethnic groupings or infrastructure or
                    anything else. Basically, the African countries headed by the Julius Nyerere,
                    said don't touch them. Whatever they are, leave them as they are, because to try
                    and begin that process of working around borders, they saw it as turning the
                    entire continent into military warfare. And, that was beginning to come on the
                    horizon again, that that whole question of political borders, military
                    incursions, civil wars, it was clearest in East Africa, in the Horn of Africa.
                    Rwanda and Burundi hadn't exploded yet. Mozambique was still trying to become
                    independent and you had a guerilla warfare going on there. You had all the
                    problems in Southern Africa. You had Angola, Namibia, and that was one area that
                    would significantly shape the direction Africa went. My answer to that was work
                    with the regional organizations. That if the countries involved had formed
                    regional organizations, a regional organization that USAID formed; if the
                    countries would come together and say, let's work together on this range of
                    problems, then we should support that, because it represented the best chance of
                    heading off the military guerilla war. Unfortunately, there were very few of
                    those kinds of regional organizations. Most of the regional organizations were
                    poorly set up and I was very negative about them. I thought they did some good,
                    but in the short run they siphoned off talent that could be better put to use in
                    the host countries. The regional organizations paid higher salaries; you get to
                    travel more; you got to be in and out of Europe more; it's a more prestigious
                    job.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I'd have to go back and look. I can't remember the top three.</p>

                <p>JOHNSON: Basically went all gung-ho private sector. Saw no reason to raise my
                    head for the government.... The question is institutional growth that unless you
                    found employment in the private sector that you were facing economic implosion.
                    Governments had employed as many people as they could; they couldn't meet the
                    government payroll; they couldn't raise revenues; there wasn't anything to tax
                    to raise the revenues to pay the payroll; and they simply were dysfunctional. I
                    didn't have any illogical or physiological hang-ups that pin it all on this one
                    and let's work on the private sector for awhile. I thought Elliott Berg's paper
                    was just an enormously effective paper of taking and marshaling the data to
                    support an argument. Africans hated it, almost every African that I talked to.
                    It condemned Africa to being a source of primary commodities that they would
                    continue to be the raw materials business and the developed world would pull the
                    raw materials out of Africa for developed nations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that Berg's line? Is that what you are saying?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No, it's not Berg's line at all. What he was saying was that in terms of
                    producing raw materials, they had lost benefits even that. That their government
                    receipts or their export earnings or whatever test you wanted to apply, they
                    were making less off of that sector than they had at independence. And, that yes
                    in the long run for development purposes it would make sense to have more
                    production done in country. But, right now, today what you don't want to do is
                    lose what you've already got. And, somehow the African countries felt that by
                    putting the emphasis on trying to maintain their raw materials, he was
                    condemning them to always be a raw materials provider. That's not what he had in
                    mind and that's not what was happening. You're familiar with the example in
                    Ghana where the Kaiser, the USAID (and the World Bank, ed) put in a dam across
                    the Volta River. The dam generated electrical power that the Kaiser Aluminum
                    Company used for an aluminum processing plant, because it is a vast consumer of
                    electrical power. And, they shipped bauxite from Jamaica to the plant to be
                    processed and reexported. The Ghanians had bauxite deposits about 80s miles up
                    country that Kaiser Aluminum kept saying, it's too expensive to get there;
                    there's dubious quality after we get there; there's no railroads; there's no
                    transport, and so they imported from Jamaica. The Ghanaians never did understand
                    why they were sitting there with an aluminum processing plant that processed
                    bauxite and they had bauxite and they wouldn't use Ghanaian bauxite.</p>

                <p>The Berg report essentially focused on maximizing what you could get out of the
                    raw materials. To too many Africans, I think it seemed like that it was
                    advocating a dead end. That the African countries will also be a raw material
                    source. Larry Saiers (USAID Africa Bureau Deputy Assistant AA , ed.), who was an
                    absolutely tremendously effective economist. He knew how to put economic
                    arguments in plain English. I came in and was Deputy in Africa DP and Larry was
                    just super-successful in getting people to understand the differences between
                    Asia and Africa and why Asia had industrialized so fast and Africa hadn't. The
                    only example I really remember, I can't recreate his argument, you'll have to
                    interview him. But, the low labor rates in the Asian countries allowed
                    manufacturing companies to go in and be able to build on a fairly discipline
                    workforce that was willing to work for very, very low wages. In Africa, as the
                    countries became independent and they kicked the expatriate colonialists out,
                    Africans felt that they should get the wage the expatriates had gotten. So, if
                    the normal going salary for a taxi driver was a thousand dollars a year with an
                    expatriate driving the taxi, you know, the African thought that he ought to get
                    a thousand dollars a year. Meanwhile, in Asia you had the taxi cab drivers for
                    twenty five cents. They said, they moved up too far too fast, in terms of what
                    they provided. And, manufacturing companies would look at Africa and look at
                    Asia and the Caribbean, and go to the Asia and the Caribbean. And, the Africans
                    felt constantly just betrayed. They took it very personally, but no one would
                    come and make an industrial investment and deal with the Africans. It was the
                    fact that your economic factors, your land, labor, cost of capital, everything
                    was just totally dysfunctional. That didn't find too many willing ears. But, I
                    was in Africa DP from '82 through '87, five years. I think that was the one
                    major shift over that time period as more African countries turned around and
                    started seeing that sections of the Berg report made a lot of sense. They
                    started developing host country policies, and you had a wave of capitalism, if
                    you will. It was more that the governments realized that the path they were on
                    wasn't going anywhere, and so therefore, “let's try something else” than any
                    real conviction; they felt that the answer was do what they tell us. A
                    combination of circumstances was that most of the donors, Margaret Thatcher for
                    Britain, I forget who in France; Reagan for the U.S. would appreciate private
                    sector capitalism as a more appropriate answer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to our program in that process, the USAID
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: The USAID program was very much boxed into the functional accounts where
                    Congress made funds available for agriculture, health, education, other sectors
                    in diminishing amounts. More was available for agriculture than for other
                    sectors. The underlying premises of legislation was the New Direction
                    legislation. You had funny accounts that really weren't appropriate. You had
                    legislation that assumed you had the institutional strength to move directly to
                    the outlying poor and to sustained development. And, you had the
                    entrepreneurship private enterprise method of development. All three were
                    working themselves out during that five year time period. It was an
                    extraordinary to be working on it, because it really turned out, I don't know if
                    you want blow-by-blow end result, but the end result was there's no one way.
                    There is no one solution that works for every country and that it re-enforced
                    the strength of the way the USAID Mission Directors in the field mission
                    programmed funds, because it emphasized that each country's got to be a little
                    bit different based upon a lot of historical factors, political variables, you
                    know, what have you. What you had was a continuation of many of the
                    institutional support projects; some of which just got called other things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Such as?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Edgerton College, Phase I and Phase II and its faculty of agriculture.
                    Sector projects, although they worked with agricultural department, they would
                    be called extension outreach. It would involve getting the faculty of
                    agriculture's planning department involved in what you could do.</p>
                <p>A lot of the titles of the projects were no longer illustrative of where the
                    money went for and how the project would be implemented. I think they passed
                    muster, if you will, with all of the authorizing officers and legal officers,
                    what have you, because the papers would direct themselves to the intent of the
                    project. It would be to develop the capacity of the Ministry of Agriculture to
                    do rain forecasting, so that emergency programs and storage programs can reflect
                    lowering the risks of dangers or provide alternate ways of meeting dangers in
                    years when there's a short fall in the rain. It is partially a change in the way
                    people approach the problem. It was partially a change in the lingo in terms of
                    vocabulary used to describe the problem. And, it was a reflection of 80s percent
                    of the USAID's staff, the most critical client group, if you will, of things
                    that don't work. Of people who got really frustrated at trying to work with
                    corrupt governments where they knew what they're doing is going to get ripped
                    off; of people who have run out of patience with governments that promise, and
                    promise, and promise and never do anything.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>The fact that McPherson came in and moved the program around, a lot of people who
                    felt very strongly that USAID had simply not been strong enough; had not been
                    tough enough; had not set its expectations and its requirements high enough in
                    the developing countries. It gave them a fertile place to bloom and spread their
                    ideas. So, McPherson really did not face internally a large opposition in terms
                    of where he wanted to take the program. I think, initially when you see his
                    initial public statements, he saw it mainly as a technical assistance agency.
                    The senior people in the Agency made a major push so that within about six
                    months to a year after he was there, he was talking about the policy component
                    and having a policy impact of what was going on, and that the technical
                    assistance was broadened out. Still, I think he had a bias against large scale
                    capital projects. The Agency, also at that point lost the funds to be a major
                    player. The projects had become so expensive that you didn't really have a lot
                    of support in the Agency for staying involved in that area. Although, some of
                    the capital project officers felt that we were missing the boat, that we should
                    go in as a minor partner with the World Bank or with the other donors and that
                    we could play a very useful role.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any fundamental shift in the types of programs
                        that got approved and those that didn't? What, in fact, was the difference
                        between the two administrations other than the rhetoric?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The rhetoric was always strongest during the first year or so. It was a
                    gradual. John Bolton was one of the strongest ideologues came in as General
                    Counsel. He quickly found out that within the USAID's system the General Counsel
                    doesn't really do a lot of policy pioneering, so he switched over and became of
                    head PPC, which was our Policy Planning Coordination Bureau. I'd say by the time
                    he left, he was a very effective Development Specialist. He still had a strong
                    ideological approach, but he calmed down and he would look at the projects and
                    whether or not they made sense in a given country. He stopped trying to do a
                    cookie cutter type of approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved in defending the Africa region budget to
                        PPC ? Or for country programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: To some extent. The way USAID development planning worked was over time
                    the Administrator gradually delegated more and more authority to the head of
                    each regional bureau for project approvals. And, then over time, even more
                    authority to the Mission Directors. DP would sit in as essentially the staff arm
                    or the critical arm to attack a project, more so than defending or presenting a
                    project. Very few projects went up to the Administrator, as I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you attacking? On what grounds did you attack a
                        project? What were you looking for or trying to avoid?JOHNSON: Initially, I
                        was trying to just bring some coherency to the whole process that the
                        questions are asked in one country of one project would be the same similar
                        questions asked across the board. The initial difference was that you had
                        more projects coming which had a private sector component usually working
                        through a PVO, a private voluntary organizations or non- government
                        organizations. The integrated rural development approach had pretty much
                        died of its own collapse. So, you didn't have that many big integrated
                        projects coming in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>You still had a lot of institutional development projects coming in, which I
                    think made eminently good sense and supported. One of the things that Tanzania
                    had done, which worked out very well, was they were doing a major health project
                    with the government. During the first two years, USAID covered all local costs;
                    third year, the government picked up 20 percent; the next year another
                    percentage; at the end of the five year project they would be funding 50s
                    percent of it and then if we extended the project two years, which we usually
                    did, by the end of the project they would be paying all of the costs. So, I
                    tried to take that and build it in to other projects, so what I brought to DP
                    was a very broad knowledge of how things worked in West Africa versus how they
                    worked in East Africa; what some of the start up problems you would face when
                    you went into a country to begin with.</p>
                <p>I guess institutionally, organizationally I fought very, very hard to have the
                    annual budget submission as the basic planning and programming document that we
                    used. The DAPs (country Development Assistance Program documents) were good.
                    They were interesting and provided overall policy guides, but it was our annual
                    budget submission which looked at three years. And, put the three years of
                    Operating Expenses (OE) and staffing against the three year projected projects.
                    It made absolutely no sense for countries to think that they could start up five
                    new projects in one year when they had two people and one of the people was
                    going on home leave.</p>
                <p>In that sense, I guess in the early years I tried to concentrate more on the
                    practicality of what could reasonably be done with OE availabilities and
                    staffing and project budgeting. And, then over time, that strategy worked out
                    for the overall Africa Bureau, and the Bureau set up a system basically of
                    triage that you have countries in which the U.S. could make a major development
                    effort that looked like the country was taking proper steps; that we could
                    mobilize the staff resources to work in that country. You had small countries
                    where you might be able to do PVO activities or NGO activities or regional
                    activities of some sort — the ones with very small missions, three to five
                    person missions. But, basically, they were not growth candidates.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>And, then you had the basket cases in the food shortage category of countries;
                    they were there because the country's own performance was so poor and because
                    political relations between the U.S. and that country were so poor, like Angola
                    at that point. You simply didn't have the basis for doing a regular development
                    program You might do a major intervention, you know, a one shot deal of some
                    type, or you might begin a program that could overtime be graduated up unto
                    category A of being a reasonable development candidate.</p>
                <p>We tried to rig the system essentially. Countries that were in the middle group,
                    we wouldn't let them over notify Congress in the sense that at the end of a
                    fiscal year funds would become available; because what you'd planned to use them
                    for you couldn't. So, every country wanted to be standing ready and willing to
                    take extra funds so they would over notify Congress then they could take money
                    at the last minute. In small countries the Mission could usually get it
                    obligated, because they could walk papers through the government. We wouldn't
                    let them over notify. It became very unpopular, because we didn't want more
                    money going into those countries. If money became available, this is where we
                    would put it. Essentially, most of the effort was trying to work out which
                    countries belong to which category, working with the economist staff, which at
                    that point we had beefed up considerably.</p>
                <p>We had five or six economists who were working in an economics unit. Then we had
                    two or three economists and anthropologists, a food aide specialist and a
                    program officer who worked in a multi-disciplinary unit that tried to work on
                    the sector plans and the long range plans. And, we had a budget unit that
                    tracked the budget and tried to make sure that obligations got made and
                    expenditures did not exceed obligations. I think, over time we began to see for
                    the five year period that I was there; you began to see some an establishment of
                    priorities among country programs where the factor of good performance by the
                    host government was evident. We were way wrong sometimes. Countries that we
                    thought were giving us good performance, weren't. Countries where we anticipated
                    good performance fell apart into the Civil War. We tried to factor that in, to
                    begin to put in performance of host countries.</p>
                <p>We maintained an interest in institutional development, but we did move far more
                    closely to immediate impact projects, where you had to be able to show what the
                    institutional strength would be used for. What we were planning on doing with,
                    for example, an analytical planning unit once you established it, and you
                    staffed it, and you had made it more effective, what were you going to use it
                    for. Also, then to be building in (well to be honest about it, I guess some of
                    my vices) regional offices, the regional programs, and regional institutions; in
                    what kinds of conditions did they work and what kind of conditions they didn't
                    work.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>I was very much a supporter of the REDSO offices, simply because the East Africa
                    office had just been a life saver when I was working in East Africa. It is not
                    set up to do what we used it for, but it was a life saver. The regional
                    institutions, yes, if the governments themselves were setting them up. I gave up
                    on regional institutions where we tried to convince governments to create
                    regional institutions. You could see from the beginning that they were going to
                    be donor creations, not a African country creation. You asked what changed
                    developmentally in terms of programs or projects. I'm not sure that anything
                    innately changed. I mean, things changed at the margin. You did see greater
                    involvement of PVO organizations; you had a much higher budget going for Africa.
                    One of the anomalies of the early Reagan years, was when you set up the firewall
                    between the military programs and the domestic programs. USAID got classified
                    with military assistance program, because that's how the Republicans saw us, the
                    best friends money can buy. But, as a result of being classified over on that
                    side of the budget, we had the best budget in the 30s years I worked with USAID.
                    We had higher budgets every year; relatively little rank hassling from Congress
                    about what the budgets go for and where. We had higher budgets; we had more
                    countries involved; we had a broader array, I think of tools, in terms of
                    working on development by bringing in the private sector, by bringing in the
                    PVO's, and the major break through, which turned out not to be so major, was
                    where we had the African Development Fund, which would be special funds just for
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A structure adjustment type of process?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: An IMF crisis type of process, which was useful, but what Larry Saiers
                    did building on what Phil Birnbaum (AA for Africa) had done, was to convince
                    Congress to create an Africa Development Fund that would separate off Africa
                    money from the rest of the Agency. The Agency took the foolish position that we
                    don't want an Africa fund, because the Africa Bureau would get more money if it
                    was just in with the rest of us. And, we said, uh huh, right. And, sub-rosely
                    and surreptitiously we continued to work with those Congressional people who
                    wanted to have a special fund. While I was in DP it was a million dollars for
                    Africa. A third of that was Economic Supporting Funds; a third of it was
                    Development Funds; and a third of it was food aid. When they set up the Africa
                    Development Fund, they set up, I think it was eight hundred million dollars in
                    development funds and it later became a billion, I think, I'm not really sure.
                    But, anyway they almost doubled the amount of development aid assistance. Part
                    of that was an assumption that Economic Supporting Funds would no longer be used
                    in Africa, that we'd have a more developmentally oriented approach. That didn't
                    happen, because the war was still going on and we still had clients states and
                    we still provided ESF funds to clients states.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>And, we still used the Phil Birnbaum Special Fund for Africa as a way to support
                    the emergency crises, IMF-type of situations. But, part of the argument for
                    getting the African fund set up was not just for the money, as it was to free
                    the Bureau from having to provide funds in the strict place (functional
                    accounts) categories. And, that the reality of African development needs, meant
                    that you couldn't put 80s percent into agriculture and get anywhere. You also
                    needed to work in other areas. It was a very logical argument, very effective
                    argument, never really made it. We got the Africa Fund so that it wasn't
                    earmarked, but created whole new concept of soft earmarks where we had to report
                    back to Congress that, okay, we no longer had X amounts legislatively satisfied
                    for population. We had to report back to Congress on what we were doing on
                    population. A good thing in environmental issues, other things like that. The
                    real intent in the underlying structure was to free the Africa Bureau and
                    reflect the priority of development, as opposed to the geo-political
                    interests.</p>
                <p>And, it did that to some extent, but to an even greater extent it got Congress
                    involved in what we did in Africa. Much more micro management that never really
                    ever totally changed. After the Africa Development Fund was established, we
                    still had most of the programs in agriculture; second to agriculture was health
                    and population. You didn't have a major shift in the sectors. You did have a
                    shift in that we were much more involved with host governments in doing policy
                    formulation, economic policy growth and policy formulation. Sector grants which
                    functioned as Supporting Assistance Funds (ESF) were non-project types of
                    assistance. I don't think anybody suspected that in a sense that the money was
                    much more closely tied to the policy directions and general support that then
                    logically you could trace; that it eventually works its way down to the farmer
                    and the small farmer, the small person. But, it did not result in the real
                    poverty outreach that people expected. Didn't really result in different
                    sectors, becoming more or less central to the program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the private sector, not the PVO area, but the
                        enterprise sector? That was a very important priority at that time. Was
                        there any initiative in that area in the African Bureau that you were
                        working with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Very little. The African Bureau had worked quite a bit in the private
                    sector in the '60s. One of the first jobs I had in Central West Africa was
                    working on the private sector, guarantee private sector loans, the OPIC, Office
                    of Private Investment Corporation, what they did, and something called Cooley
                    loans, which was using local currency generated by other P.L. 480 programs to
                    give loans to indigenous businessmen.PL480 commodity program. Most of those, the
                    OPIC types of things tended to be a flash in the pan. The private sector guys
                    who went looking into Africa in terms of investing something got quickly
                    negative, because of inability to work with local governments who really saw
                    them as real colonialists coming back to grab off assets. The Cooley loans, most
                    of them turned out to be unprofitable and we wound up owning textile plants and
                    shoe factories and anything else. We went back in Sudan and as a matter of fact,
                    one of the first things we had to do was pull them out all the local currency
                    loans that had been made, that for some reason that I never understood, were all
                    shifted to the Asia Bureau. The Asia Bureau had all the records and so we pulled
                    up to find out what assets we still owned in Sudan and if we still had any
                    nationalization issues or expropriation issues. So, by the time, ten years later
                    when I was working in Africa DP, the view was highly skeptical, a lot of the
                    private sector concerns So, I tended to ask a lot of questions. Mr. Ruddy loved
                    it when I asked questions of socialist governments or other governments. So, I
                    had full support in terms of doing that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you think we could do or did anything work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I cannot right off hand think of anything that worked. In one of my
                    first meetings with Frank Ruddy (AA for Africa in USAID), I had just come back
                    from Uganda and I was trying to explain to him that the Ugandans wanted us to
                    put in a sugar mill; they were having to import all of their sugar up through
                    Nairobi and the Kenyan Railroad; they had a lot of cane syrup and they could
                    make sugar as they had in the past. And, that a sugar processing plant would be
                    absolutely sure to go in Uganda and beyond that you could become a regional
                    marketing facility and sell to Rwanda and Burundi and Eastern Zaire. One of the
                    problems with doing that was that there was a World Bank team in Burundi working
                    on a sugar processing plant so that they would no longer have to import through
                    Tanzania; they would have a regional facility that could sell to Burundi,
                    Rwanda, Uganda and Zaire. For most of the investments that people talked about
                    making or the host governments wanted them to make (let's put it that way)
                    essentially, their financial feasibility depended upon setting up a series of
                    legal protections and giving them a protection that nobody else had access to.
                    And, since we were pushing for open markets, open societies, most of those
                    investments were not appropriate for us to get involved in. Off hand, I can't
                    think of any we did in Africa that were large.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you creating an environment for investment? Was there
                        anything of that type of program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Most of the policy work that was being done with Birnbaum's Africa
                    Development Fund, or Africa's special fund and then later the Africa Development
                    Fund. Most of those were based upon creating a climate or creating an
                    environment in which indigenous private enterprise could prosper. Although,
                    there were some components that would relate to foreign investment, such as the
                    stability of the currency, control of exports, imports, that kind of thing. Most
                    of the emphasis was upon getting rid of rules and regulations and monopolies
                    that prohibited small enterprises from being developed indigenously and
                    internally. And, world wide, there were a lot better places for investment, in
                    Asia and Latin America than they were in Africa. So, you didn't have a lot of
                    people pounding at our door. For most of those who did they wanted special
                    protection and special rights. And, we said, do we want to encourage the
                    government to do that. You have to be competitive or it's not an appropriate
                    investment.</p>
                <p>One of the other things I remember that Ruddy did that institutionally broke
                    total holes in the wall was, he had a two day seminar with banking institutions
                    who called in their banking officers from Nairobi, Johannesburg and Ibadan and
                    talked about how they functioned, how they saw private sector and a private
                    enterprise, and what they could lend for and what they couldn't lend for. And
                    that most of these guys who really were Senior Vice Presidents of the banking
                    society could not approve a loan of more than a hundred thousand without sending
                    it all the way back to their headquarters bank for a full review. This was when
                    our Mission Directors were doing twenty million. So, it's really surprising at
                    the limit of confidence they had and at the level of investment they were
                    looking to. It opened up a whole new source of information on Africa that we
                    never tapped, because those guys knew Africa and knew it in a way that we had no
                    idea. That was, I think was beneficial and good that broaden participation and
                    broadened our view of what it took to make it all happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe we should touch on the New Directions policy, when
                        it was fading away. Do you have any special views about the purpose and the
                        structure and what worked and not worked in that concept?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: My perception of New Directions was it was crafted by a very small group
                    on the Hill and essentially it represented compromised legislation. And, that if
                    they all gave Nixon what he wanted on Vietnam, you know, but do what the Hill
                    wanted in terms of development. It wouldn't be that important anyway. At that
                    point, it had got gunned down and down and down. A big chunk of the USAID budget
                    was going to Vietnam and the Far East. And, so the legislation wound up being
                    written by a very small group of people on the Hill who really, in my opinion
                    didn't really understand how the USAID program worked and tried to tie it to far
                    too narrow definition of what you needed to do for development. Even if you
                    redefined it so that the U.S. was not interested in development that the host
                    government had to do development and the big multi level donors had to do
                    development. We were interested in improving the quality of life of the people
                    who were the rural, rural poor, rural majority. I think that definition of what
                    the USAID's role should be was working there. I think USAID wound up being less
                    helpful than it could be and many countries where we did those programs were
                    very select narrow in time frame. I think that over time, it was almost like the
                    integrated rural development activities in Sahel. You had five years extension,
                    seven years before the donors pulled out, you know, there's nothing left. It
                    hadn't made any difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The time frame was too short?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The time frame was too short, but it was also, countries didn't have, I
                    mean people understood that if you don't have the physical infrastructure of
                    roads that you're not going to get very far. That development is... I guess for
                    Somalia they use to talk about... that it is imagining that you were trying to
                    provide assistance to a country that went from Maine to Florida and as far west
                    as Chicago and you had roads that would take you as far as Annapolis and
                    Richmond. How in God's green name do you get resources out even in an emergency
                    feeding program without a physical infrastructure. Gradually, over time,
                    partially by the failure of a whole lot of the integrated rural development
                    projects, people understood that you also need a human capacity infrastructure.
                    That doesn't mean that everybody has a Ph.D. It doesn't mean that you trained
                    lawyers and doctors in place of engineers, but that you need skilled people if
                    the country's going to run. The legislation was simply too narrow, because it
                    assumed you did leap frog and have growth in one area that would be sustainable.
                    Also, it was early, but I think they were beginning to get some of the
                    sustainable development arguments towards the end of that period in DP.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Their concern was sustainability?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yeah..., of what happens when donors pull out. It was pretty funny
                    though; it was coming in as one of the arguments. In the initial years people
                    made, I think a really good faith effort and ultimately wasted hours and hours
                    in debating philosophy and New Directions to say, okay, what is the need for a
                    project; what does this mean for countries. By the end of the time period,
                    people sort of paid lip service to it, but went ahead and developed the program
                    they felt the country needed. You had some ridiculous cases where in the
                    Congressional Presentation we were suppose to identify who the beneficiaries
                    were. And, there was a very narrow definition of New Directions. You had
                    projects costing millions and millions of dollars that benefited the 20 families
                    who live in section A. Or creating a statistical analysis unit in the Ministry
                    of Agriculture with the beneficiaries being the 2.2 million small farmers who
                    benefit from the fact that they can forecast weather. So, the link between what
                    we did and the beneficiary became more attenuated and spread out and
                    definitionly full of loop holes that you could drive a Mac truck through. At
                    that point, I don't think anybody in Congress cared in terms of standing up and
                    jumping up and down. They didn't have enough success stories either from us or
                    from other donors to where they could say, you should do more of this. Oddly
                    enough, the PVO community had come over from being a strong critic of what we
                    were trying to do, to being a supporter of what we were trying to do and saying,
                    yeah, USAID needs to work at the policy level in the capitol, because you get
                    the policies right, you get the resources right before our small projects will
                    have a chance of working. And, you need to have USAID training midwives if our
                    rural health policy is ever to have an impact. The PVO community became much
                    more, I think a supporter of USAID, but still felt that in too many cases USAID
                    went for the large project over the small project that they weren't attuned to
                    on the Hill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the three Deputy system (three DAAs) in the
                        Bureau? That was a major organizational change from what it had been before.
                        How did you find that since you were in the middle of it all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yeah, I was in the middle of it all. Each of the geographic area
                    deputies really felt the need to have their own Development Planning Office
                    (DP). So, they basically created a full time workload for DP and weren't willing
                    to say, well we have to do this Liberia paper next week, we'll do Kenya the week
                    after that. You had just a constant staffing pressure in my office so that I had
                    to wind up brokering between the two deputies and satisfying neither. You had an
                    inability to broker resources where the Ethiopia program became the East Africa
                    contingency fund and I got to program whatever I wanted to do, rather than it go
                    back to the Bureau. Both of the geographic deputies wanted to do that. That
                    their initial OYB's at the start of the year gave them their quota of money and
                    if you had to switch around you switched around within your area. They didn't
                    want to lose money to the other geographic deputy. On the other hand, when it
                    came to a crisis and they needed more money, they wanted to take money from the
                    other deputy. We had classic situations where, I can't remember, I think it was
                    the DAA on one side, and Glenn Patterson was Deputy on the other side, and Glenn
                    left town and headed for Paris to a Consultative Group meeting on Mauritius
                    where he had been told in his briefing papers by all appropriate people that he
                    would offer Mauritius X million dollars and feel free. Phil was leaving town and
                    going to a debt rescheduling in London and he was going to a round table meeting
                    in Geneva. So, he left town; the PL480 that was supposed to be promised to
                    Mauritius that Glenn was giving away in Paris. We wound up with people trying to
                    double count using the same resource twice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't the principal Deputy supposed to be dealing with
                        these kind of things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Ray Love (Deputy Administrator African Bureau) was supposed to be
                    dealing with that sort of thing and in theory I was supposed to be dealing with
                    that sort of thing as head of DP and working with both sides. I always felt that
                    I blew the whistle that hey, we've got duplication or competition here that
                    somebody needs to set the priority for the whole Bureau and that Ray would do
                    that. Ray didn't see that as part of his job supervising the two Deputies. It's
                    a little bit like John Withers (Director, Office of Development Resources) being
                    able to articulately describe what was wrong with an office and forget to
                    mention that he was the Office Director and therefore had some responsibility
                    for straightening it out. Ray didn't see his job as supervising the Deputies and
                    so when I would say, hey Ray, I need some backup, I need some support, he would
                    tell me things, good things, in terms of negotiating points that I could then go
                    and negotiate with the two deputies. But, it was still me negotiating with two
                    guys. It didn't work out very well. PL480 was probably the most difficult to try
                    and work out, because of the resource that's programmed outside the Bureau. The
                    budget levels tended to be contentious, but we worked those out, mainly because
                    Frank got involved in those when he was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why do you think they created a three Deputy
                        arrangement?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: The feeling was that the Bureau had grown too fast; too far; too many
                    countries; that the span of control for one Deputy was simply too great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think it worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No. I don't think it worked at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did other people think about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: In terms of the comparisons that go on between the Africa Bureau, the
                    Asia Bureau, the LA Bureau, Middle East, what other configuration do you have.
                    You still wind up with the Africa Bureau's papers being the latest to get in;
                    that they had apparently the most difficulty in meeting deadlines; had
                    apparently the most difficulty in recruiting staff, competent to fill positions,
                    because we weren't regarded as being a competitive recruiter. So, that whole
                    management overhead range didn't change that as far as I could see. Both of the
                    Deputy AA's saw their job as getting more resources for their area, which was
                    not an unusual need, but it was just the opposite of where I guess my head was
                    at the time.</p>
                <p>I was arguing that it wasn't a question of more resources, that you could pour
                    money into Sudan, I mean it's black hole. You could pour as much money in the
                    sand as you wanted to, but you weren't going to get anything out of it.
                    Essentially, we showed six countries where we had a reasonably chance of having
                    development. The politically hot countries that attracted a lot of money were
                    the most risky in terms of development results. As a substantive argument under
                    all that, you had a gradual shift of resources from Central West Africa to
                    Southern Africa and from Central Southeast Africa to North Africa. We had more
                    money going into the Sudan and the Somali and into the Zambia and Zimbabwe and
                    less going into the Sahel, that middle belt which essentially were the poor
                    countries. We had some major policy clashes over East African countries with the
                    new Deputy Administrator of East Africa and Somalia. He rolled back and pulled
                    the plug on Somalia. The package of projects that the mission had come in with
                    represented starting up seven new projects in the space of 18 months. And, we
                    had a major, major fight over the ABS budget submission in which Glenn Patterson
                    tried to keep everybody calmed down and under control, but that he treated it as
                    an illustrious ABS. Where I was in the hard head radical fashion pushing for
                    getting Somalis to zero in the budget process, or if you do anything you do it
                    through the economic supporting funds. They simply didn't have a development
                    case. Glenn and then Lois Richards (new DAA and replaced Phil and to my
                    surprise, I worked very well with Lois.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Lois Richards, who I thought would micro manage and she didn't at all.
                    About that time that I decided that my effectiveness in Africa DP had come to an
                    end. I was in too many fights and was losing too many fights. Mark Edelman was
                    the new Assistant Administrator for Africa and Mark really wanted to pick his
                    own DP Director. He was hung up on the fact that I was Civil Service and they
                    wanted somebody from the Foreign Service in there.</p>
                <p>So, I decided to make one last push at getting into the Foreign Service. I would
                    take a year off and go down to the University of North Carolina or Duke
                    University Medical Center, which ran a weight loss program and it was tied into
                    basically physiology, medical, exercise and nutrition and see if I could get
                    myself in well enough shape so I could go in to Foreign Service. So, they agreed
                    and gave me leave without pay to go off and do it and I went down to North
                    Carolina and found out that I was right on schedule. It was perfect timing for
                    my mid-career crisis, on the way I want to do it and when I want to go. It
                    turned out to be an extraordinary beneficial time period for me, just in terms
                    of thinking where I stood and what I wanted to do. I loss some weight, but not
                    enough. So, came back to USAID and USAID didn't know what to do with me.</p>
                <p>This was 1987. Came back to the Agency; well first of all, I was a GS15 program
                    officer and had been a GS15 at that point almost 10 years. Most of the jobs that
                    I qualified for were filled with Foreign Service Officers. Most of the Foreign
                    Service Officers were Senior Foreign Service Officers, so they had to down grade
                    the job in order for me to qualify for it. When I came back from North Carolina
                    I took the position that that was very flattering, but how about upgrading me
                    rather than upgrading the job. They said, ummmm. So, I wound up doing a whole
                    series of temporary TDY's. Went out to Khartoum for six or eight months. Went
                    from Khartoum to the South Pacific, a regional organization. The Regional
                    Development Organization for the South Pacific was located in Fiji and there
                    handled eight or nine other countries.</p>
                <p>I went back to Sudan and I worked on that job, which to this day the job
                    description is classified, Because during the two months I was out there, they
                    had a major flood where Khartoum got, I guess it was 24 inches in 12 hours and
                    the whole place was flooded. I never did the job I was supposed to do anyway,
                    which the job was bring food into Tigris and Eritrea in order to stop the
                    refugees coming into Eastern Sudan. The government of Sudan supported it, but
                    the Mission Director in Sudan felt that he should not handle it, because he was
                    working with the government on some new programs, so I was detailed to the
                    Embassy. Then, because of the flood you couldn't get any travel, roads washed
                    out, no food moved, anything. So, I wound up doing three months of counselor
                    work with political refugees. It was very interesting, but it was side
                    track.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you ever get involved in delivering food to the
                        refugees?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Well, it happened after I left, but during the period I was there it
                    didn't. I left there in July of '88 and went to the South Pacific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: South Pacific, that's quite a transition.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Washington still couldn't figure out what to do with me, so I continued
                    on my series of TDY's and went to the South Pacific to the Regional South
                    Pacific Office, which had a Regional Development Office in Fiji with no
                    bilateral aid to Fiji. But, Fiji was the islands that had the connections like
                    Barbados did. Fiji had the airplane connections to get in and out of all the 11
                    islands that were receiving aid from the U.S. I went out to South Pacific for
                    two months to do a strategic planning document with themes. There were certain
                    themes that would be carried on throughout the islands, but each island would
                    have its own bilateral laid program. And, the one theme of course, was
                    population and health. Another theme was environment; another theme was the
                    private sector initiative in fishing and some agricultural exporting ideas. I
                    wound up doing a strategic plan and the budget submission, which called for
                    increasing the level to the South Pacific from about five to six million a year
                    to 20 to 30 million a year. That was accepted in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your role in the South Pacific?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I was going to say, the South Pacific came through at that point with
                    the offer for a TDY and I took it. It was a very small office in terms of budget
                    and people. They had gotten approval from the Asian Bureau to use personal
                    service contracts for staffing in lieu of direct hire. So, they had OE funding
                    contractors and a green light from the Bureau.</p>
                <p>At that point, I'd worked with start up countries and regional programs enough to
                    where if they wanted someone with my background to take a look at, you know,
                    what would be a justification for increasing the program levels. If you
                    increased them, how would you staff yourself to carry them out and manage them
                    and what would you do, substantially. And, the justification of why we should do
                    more in the South Pacific was already agreed to. The AA for the Asia Bureau was
                    a former Peace Corp volunteer from one of the islands and the Assistant
                    Secretary, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State for Africa was a former Peace
                    Corps volunteer from one of the islands, and George H.W. Bush had been off in
                    the South Pacific. We were coming up on the 50th anniversary of World War II and
                    the fact that thousands of Americans lost their lives fighting over these
                    islands. Essentially, they had been ignored by us for the next 50s years. So, I
                    came back with a strategic plan for the area which argued that the Regional
                    Office should run each country as a separate development objective.</p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Each country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Each country, which I had a hard time selling, because you had countries
                    with a total populations of 2,000 people. You know, it was..., why do we want to
                    have a USAID program? Why can't we just have regional projects and then they
                    could get some of the regional benefits. I was backed up by John Woods who was a
                    Mission Director. The argument was, the Regional Office can back stop the
                    programs, but if you really want to have an impact on the countries, you have to
                    interact with their developing planning office, their Ministries of Health. You
                    can't just have a regional contractor who wanders in and out of all the
                    countries. In the real small islands it probably did make sense to only do a
                    training program, but you set a training program before them, rather than having
                    a regional training program that just drops scholarships here and there. And, in
                    terms of management, that they should keep the Regional Office in Fiji, which
                    was the old problem that you know about from Abidjan. Fiji was well enough off
                    to where they really didn't have a development program there. But, because it
                    was the nexus of all the airplanes and the traffic, if we have the USAID Office
                    there, then the Embassy would get upset that they had all these USAID people
                    wandering around and no USAID program in Fiji. Eventually the State Department
                    put ESF money in to Fiji and wound up having a small ESF program there that
                    worked primarily, as I recall, on a democracy project helping provide Xerox
                    machines, a parliamentary house and other thing like that.</p>
                <p>The program was strongly environmental. That became the major thrust to what we
                    did on each of the islands where we started a program, which got into private
                    sector marketing, private sector agricultural development and marketing, because
                    you had a fairly active private sector import-export group that did export
                    copper and (?) So, you had something of a nucleus there to work with.</p>
                <p>I started up a program in New Guinea which as far as I could figure out was like
                    20 years behind Africa. And, got pushed into doing some developmental activities
                    there, rather than doing institutional development, which is what I thought we
                    ought to do, but they wanted more presence, so they wanted USAID to do more
                    things. We wound up working on a big fishing project there that was pretty
                    successful. We were in fishing as our agriculture sector. It was a nice little
                    program and lasted about three years. No, it lasted longer than that, because
                    this was in '88 and Brian Atwood (USAID Administrator) saw the South Pacific as
                    one of the programs to be consolidated when he grouped the programs; the people
                    out there kept saying, but they shouldn't, this isn't fair. These programs and
                    the governments work. The host countries are doing what they ought to do. At
                    that time, we were cutting programs out in countries where the host government
                    wasn't carrying its share of the burden and etc. etc. etc. The implication was
                    that if you cut a country out that it was a wrong doer. And, the islands didn't
                    do much, but they weren't very big.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were we interested in the islands at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It was a combination of reasons. The major thrust was that then, the
                    Assistant Administrator for the Asia Bureau had been a Peace Core volunteer out
                    in the islands and one of the Deputy Assistant Secretaries of State for Africa
                    had been a Peace Core volunteer on the islands. The 50th anniversary of World
                    War II was coming up and it was the Guadalcanal, the Solomon Islands, Tarawa.
                    All the names that are familiar from World War II movies, if anything else and
                    the American shed blood for. A feeling that nothing had happened since World War
                    II, and that a number of the islands were essentially French colonies. We had
                    American Samoa, which was essentially a colony. The assistance to American Samoa
                    and to the northern islands, the Marianas, I forget who else was up there, were
                    all handled by the U.S. Department of Interior, which sent out a local rep and
                    tried to run aid programs and absolutely did not want any advice from USAID on
                    its experience in running aid programs. In most peoples opinion they were
                    running a disaster and so the idea was that USAID would become more involved in
                    the Southern Pacific; would show by example how you could help the islands that
                    maybe the Department of Interior would pick up on, and that the islands were, as
                    small as they were, they still were represented in the United Nations.
                    Therefore, the U.S. should remain on good terms with those islands and most of
                    them were supportive of the U.S. So, you had a combination of reasons. I think,
                    the case for increasing the aid levels was made before I did a paper. The paper
                    just served as the written paper trail, if you will.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Economic Supporting Assistance fund?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The Economic Supporting Assistance fund (ESF) and approximately at the
                    same time, they did approve a million dollars for ESF funds for Fiji, because
                    the Ambassador was so upset that there were no bilateral aid to Fiji and he had
                    his seven person USAID Office there.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>Also, extremely interesting, the U.S. had negotiated a fishing treaty, which
                    involved Japan, all the islands, and the American fishing fleet, as to what kind
                    of fish could be taken, and what time of year the tonnage and everything. Then,
                    at some point and I'm not really sure of the time period here, but I think it
                    was in 1985 or '86, one of the islands had seized an American fishing boat for
                    fishing illegally in their waters. It was like the mouse that roared kind of
                    thing. They had gone out at night and seized the boat while everybody was in
                    town at a tavern and then here was the U.S. threatening to send carriers and
                    airplanes to get the fishing boat back. Partially because there were feelings
                    for that and for other fishing kinds of conflicts and collisions, the U.S.
                    negotiated a fishing treaty, whereby the American Tuna Association, the American
                    Fisheries Association, or something, the equivalent America marketing group put
                    up ten million dollars to be available for fisheries, fishing development or
                    fishy problems, fishy related problems on the islands. And, USAID became the
                    administrator of that ten million dollars. It totally bypassed the USAID
                    structure and the congressional structure in Washington. It came through the
                    State Department and the private sector directly to the governments, which as
                    part of the agreement they'd written with the governments, the government had to
                    co-program with USAID on the use of the money. So, there was this chunk of money
                    which also in some cases involved the local currency that the USAID Office out
                    there programmed and most of it was for fishing, fishing development.Q: So, it
                    was tied to fishing?</p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It was very loosely tied. The USAID Mission did the tying more than the
                    actual agreement, because the agreement had enough loop holes to drive the
                    proverbial truck through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did they do with all that money; the fish money and
                        the 25 million dollars?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Like I said, you had rural health, primary health and family planning
                    activities. You had an HIV/AID's Program; you had an environmental program.
                    Again, on each island there would be a different type of environmental program,
                    so they did vary. But, the environment was a major theme of the whole program.
                    In fishing development we put in piers, outfitted boats to have long nets
                    instead of short nets. One of the Women in Development Program... the women do
                    the fishing in the coves where you walk out into the water and the water is
                    never higher than your waist. Men do the long haul fishing where they'll go out
                    in the boats and stay for two or three weeks and then come back. So, we worked
                    with the women to come up with ways where they could do the cove fishing and
                    create better conditions for them so they didn't wind up with so many related
                    problems and diseases from wading in the water up to their waist. There were
                    educational programs on how to not fish out certain coves, because the tendency
                    was to fish until the cove was completely non-responsive and then move to
                    another cove. So, we worked on some environmental programs with the women. We
                    worked with a lot of PVO's who were out there ....</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Local or international?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: International, but primarily U.S. related to Peace Core Volunteers who
                    had been in the islands and then had come home and had set up some sort of
                    continuing relationship, the Friends of the South Pacific. The Peace Core
                    program was very active throughout all the islands too. I'm trying to think of
                    what else. Environmentally we had a major issue with the Japanese; the Japanese
                    fishing approach was to catch everything in these huge nets and then dump
                    anything that wasn't commercial fish, which resulted in an enormous waste of
                    fishing resources. So, we had a couple of negotiations with the Japanese in
                    trying to work out joint fisheries programs with the Japanese.</p>
                <p>With the education program, which we had a scholarship program, having
                    scholarships for each island, which was a continual pain in the neck, because
                    the students had to go to Fiji to get an American Visa. They couldn't get one
                    out of the Embassy or the Counselor Officer on their own island.</p>
                <p>All of the visa applicants had to go to Fiji and USAID worked out a way of having
                    housing and food for them while they waited for their visas to come through and
                    then they would pay for their airport transportation to the States. We were
                    constantly missing deadlines in terms of the student has to be here by August
                    29th in order to start orientation. And, September 20th the student was still
                    sitting in Fiji waiting for his visa. A lot of just really strong feelings I
                    guess I came away from the South Pacific as to what is the Embassy role was. I
                    had a much easier time picking out a USAID role in the islands than I did the
                    Embassy role. The Embassy really was a meet and greet for American investors. It
                    was a place for them to go in and say hello, shake hands, get a briefing about
                    the local economy in the countries and then leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any Americans to worry about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Had a lot of tourists, major tourists, that if you are going to
                    Australia or New Zealand, Fiji is a connecting flight and has an enormous
                    investment from the Japanese on atoll development. It's a major tourist
                    attraction. The Fijian government actually worked it very nicely where they
                    built each hotel but didn't sell the beach front. The beach front was considered
                    needed land, but the hotels could get long term leases on the local area. But,
                    then they had to sit down with the local chiefs and figure out employment
                    opportunities for how the Fijians could actually get the work at the hotels. In
                    Fiji it was particularly difficult, because historically when the British came
                    and set up the colonies, they found that the Fijians were very quarrelsome, not
                    very productive as farm workers; they wanted to set up sugar plantations, so
                    they imported Indians from India who then worked the sugar factories and the
                    sugar plantations. As a consequence, they set up an incredible polarization of
                    society between the Indians and the Fijians. Indians had been there for four
                    generations and 200 years later are still considered Indians. And, if anything
                    happens the India Consular goes trotting down and tries to work it out. They all
                    carry Indian passports. They're the Fijians after 20 years.</p>

                <p>JOHNSON: Small, very small. I can't remember.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Definitely under a million. I remember some of the islands we worked
                    with were like 2,500 and 7,000. A big island was one that had over a hundred
                    thousand. Fiji is the most developed of all the islands, but I can't remember
                    what the figures are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they have any local capacity to carry out the
                        programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The Fijians had an enormous local capacity in trained Indians. You had
                    very few Fijians who really wanted to go to school. They didn't like school, so
                    they wouldn't go in it for advanced degrees and they wouldn't stick around to
                    get their degrees. The Fijians liked primarily to volunteer for the U.N.
                    military police. They're scattered all over the world with the U.N. security
                    arrangements, because that's an admiral and honorable way to see world and then
                    you go off and do some fighting. Historically, a very war liked people. It's
                    military arrangements are still admired and honored. Very few Fijians go into
                    business. A lot go into government, but they don't go into business. The Indians
                    tend to predominate in business and lawyers and doctors in professional fields.
                    You would have had a very high trained capacity of Fijians. Our problem is that,
                    because Fiji did have a high trained development capacity and they had a high
                    per capita income, we didn't do bilateral assistance with Fiji. We had the
                    Regional Officers, but they worked with the Solomon Islands, the Christmas
                    Islands, a couple of French Islands that are still under the French control, all
                    of which have extremely limited development capacity. They simply didn't have
                    functioning government structures in a lot of ways. Most of them, however, had
                    been taken over in some sort of adoption fashion. Like New Zealand had
                    particularly close relationship with two or three islands; Australia had close
                    relationships; the French had close relationships with different islands. So,
                    one of the things that USAID had carved out as an area that we would work on was
                    donor coordination in trying to get more donors into one set of islands, so you
                    didn't have one donor dominating the whole economy and the government. They were
                    trying to develop little mini-donor group discussions. There were half a dozen
                    interregional organizations. An interregional organization on shipping;
                    interregional organizational on health; interregional organization on airlines
                    and so on to get the islands to see themselves as working together through those
                    interregional groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Politically they would never be brought together?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: No, politically they had no interest; they had no background of history
                    of being associated with each other. Fiji and Tonga probably had a history of
                    fighting each other more than anything else and would use the long range canoes
                    almost like the Vikings did to wage war back and forth on each other. Beautiful,
                    beautiful part of the world though. I could see why people served as volunteers
                    or had anything to do with it, you know; they would have a feeling of continuing
                    commitment of trying to do something in that area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Most of our work was carried out through PVO's?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: PVO's and some contract groups. The USAID office essentially consisted
                    of about seven people, three of whom were OE funded private service contractors.
                    One was Australian; two, I think were New Zealand; and one was a New Zealander
                    married to a Carabaos girl. The argument was that they simply couldn't recruit
                    Americans to go out there when they'd have vacancies and they'd try to go
                    through the USAID Personnel System to fill the vacancies. They'd come up with
                    people who were willing to go out there for a year or two years</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many Americans did we have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I think there were only about four (USAID) Americans there. The problem
                    was that the South Pacific program had been perceived as a good place to go on
                    your last tour before you retired. There was very little activity there. Then,
                    they sent John Woods out who was a product of the Africa Bureau; he was very
                    activist and raring to go and by no means, mentally or physically ready to
                    retire. They sent him out because of the promise or the mandate, if you will,
                    that they were going to increase the program and he should start in motion all
                    of the steps it would take to increase the program.</p>

                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: The projects worked really well. Sharon Fee was in the Regional Office
                    in '96 and '97, ten years after I left; I talked to her about the projects and
                    they were all working. The same projects weren't still active, but the Mission
                    was still in the same general theme areas of working with beneficiaries on the
                    environment, working private sector, and health, population and HIV/AIDS. They
                    worked pretty well. Sharon said they got really good cooperation in health from
                    the governments, that the people that were assigned to the projects tended to be
                    good and tended to stay with the projects. There wasn't a lot of switching
                    around. She was very upset when the Atwood's (USAID Administrator) decision that
                    came down in '95, '96 to close down programs that weren't performing, which
                    became translated into close down programs without local (support ed?), because
                    she felt that it was the wrong program to close down. They pulled the USAID
                    Office out of Fiji; I think they do some general regional support types of
                    things out of the Philippines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to the projects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The projects were ended. Contractors were sent home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They just finished work and walked away?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: They walked away, yeah. Sharon's feeling was that the implication and
                    all of the public announcements were that we were closing down programs in
                    countries where the host governments hadn't held up their part of the bargain,
                    or for poor performance, or for various invidious kinds of reasons. And, the
                    South Pacific essentially got tired of that brush, when in fact, the programs
                    there worked very well and that they'd made good progress on all of the
                    individual type goals and in the general themes of health and environmental, but
                    simply because it was a small program. The political Godfathers, if you will, in
                    State and USAID who had supported the expansion were out because they were
                    Republicans, so essentially we closed them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think we had a substantial impact with that
                        program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: It's hard to say. And clearly, the U.S. had a substantial impact on the
                    islands in World War II. I mean, just absolute total impact on the islands to
                    where they developed, you may have heard of them, Cargo Cults, where the
                    airplanes flew in with all this cargo of specialty items and food and drinks
                    that no one in the islands had ever seen before. So, they developed religious
                    cults around the shipment of goods and services through these cargo planes. I
                    was told, to this day, you will have an isolated tribe that essentially worships
                    an icebox. They'll adorn the icebox with candles and wreaths and periodically
                    have services there, and periodically they'll open the doors to see if it's
                    filled up yet. Since the icebox is still empty, they'll close the door and say
                    they haven't prayed enough. And, they call them Cargo Cults and they're still
                    active throughout the South Pacific.</p>
                <p>At the same time you have absolute first rate air service, Fiji Airlines flown by
                    the Fijians; you have the Air Traffic Controllers, who all have moved into the
                    modern world and clearly handle communication equipment with no problems. You
                    have one of the more sophisticated inter-island shipping systems for export
                    goods that I think has ever been developed.</p>
                <p>It is much more difficult there than in the Caribbean, because in the Caribbean
                    the islands are closer to each other. Essentially to this day, you can sail from
                    one Caribbean island to another and not lay down or put your anchor out and stay
                    overnight and then go the next day during day light. In the South Pacific,
                    you're talking about weeks where you'll go before you see the sight of land
                    again. The South Pacific is a huge ocean. It is like one little finger tip on
                    your piggy; it would be the Caribbean compared to your whole body being the
                    South Pacific Ocean. So, you think about the Caribbean as being islands, and
                    they are, but not in the same sense of isolated, long distance, communication
                    kinds of things that you face with the South Pacific.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the impact of health and education
                        programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Health programs, from what I got back, had a hard time. Not because of
                    lack of personnel; it was just lack of priority. The South Pacific Islanders
                    tended to be very healthy. They didn't pressure the government for a lot of
                    health services, because they just didn't see a need for it. Some, who were
                    trying to work with the HIV/AIDs Program, were trying to break through, the myth
                    that the South Pacific Islanders don't get HIV/AIDs, you know, weren't
                    susceptible to them for some reason. The doctor that was out there said, that
                    part of the trouble was they had a very, very low rate and it was hard to figure
                    out that maybe there was some reason why. So, he was trying to get some AIDs
                    research done out there to see whether or not there was some natural immunity
                    going on. I think, even in terms of raising the awareness of people of critical
                    diseases and how vulnerable islands can be to a critical disease, really had an
                    impact. Again, I think people brought to the United States, trained in the
                    United States, returned to home, had the most lasting impact that we had.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good. Anymore on the islands? You were there how
                        long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: First trip out I was there for two months and later I went back for
                    another TDY and was there for about six months.</p>
                <p>Over a three year period I did a series of overseas TDY's that went from working
                    on the management assessment in Latin America, in Brazil, Peru and Mexico, to
                    doing the Sudan for refugees with the Embassy, to doing the strategic planning
                    for the South Pacific. At one point I asked Ray Love, who at that point was
                    Counselor to the Agency, how long was personnel going to let me keep doing this
                    floating around and charting my own individual TDY's. At that point, I reported
                    to no one, other than Ray who used to be my boss when I was in the Africa
                    Bureau. So, I asked Ray, how long was personnel going to let me keep on doing
                    this. I was enjoying it and I was getting a lot of overseas experience, but I
                    couldn't really see that the Agency structuring this program just for me. A lot
                    of people in Personnel were still mad at me, because I pulled off two years on
                    TDY to Cameroon. They were questioning whether what I was doing was serious or
                    was it just my own development program. Ray's response was, that as long as
                    there was a need, essentially the Agency had to send somebody. If it hadn't been
                    me, it would have been somebody else.</p>
                <p>For a while there I became a specialist on the islands, that was the other thing.
                    I worked in the Seychelles, Marianas, Comoros, Madagascar, Indian Oceans
                    Islands, and then I worked the South Pacific Islands, and then when I came back
                    from South Pacific I went over to Grenada and I worked in the Caribbean Islands.
                    Most governments functioned. The areas are small enough and their variables are
                    enough under control that the islands do okay. Much like Hong Kong or Singapore.
                    It's just a lot more feasible than if you're talking about Somalia that goes
                    from Maine to Florida and as far as Chicago. It has one road that goes to
                    Richmond. Islands were fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about Grenada, because it had an interesting
                        part of U.S. involvement. What was the situation when you got involved in
                        Grenada. You were assigned there, I guess for awhile.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: My perspective on Grenada was very much from an organizational
                    perspective. I was still wandering around and the Agency didn't know what to do
                    with me. They never offered me a permanent job, so I was taking all these TDY.
                    The feeling that the more experienced I got, the better officer I would be. And,
                    after the invasion of Grenada, the Caribbean had a Regional Development Office
                    in Barbados, which again was a situation where Barbados didn't receive any
                    direct bilateral aid, but had the airplane connections where you could get to
                    the other islands. In the RDO Caribbean program, they had a series of regional
                    projects in agriculture, health, shipping, democracy. The Mission would
                    establish an OYB (Operating Year Budget) for each country within the overall
                    Washington allocation. The individual countries and individual embassies hated
                    it. They felt that they should get their allocation directly from Congress. So,
                    for the two years I was down there was a period where the RDO was trying to keep
                    each of the countries happy with this regional approach. Meanwhile, the State
                    Department was agitating for a bilateral approach. State was getting ESF funds,
                    specifically directed to a country and for, an example, a project to build the
                    road in Antigua. We also ended up with congressional earmarks saying that you
                    will spend X amount of dollars in Y country.</p>
                <p>In the midst of all this, when Grenada was originally invaded, the first thing
                    they did after the shooting stopped was to set up a bilateral aid program, which
                    was to help the country. It was set up with an USAID bilateral office in
                    Grenada, St. Georges; it had its own bilateral projects; it had its own
                    allocation of funds from Congress. But, the Associate Director in Grenada
                    reported to the Regional Director in Barbados and for some of the technical
                    specialists would pull on staff out of the Regional Office.</p>
                <p>As I heard it after the fact, the Mission Director in Barbados had spent most of
                    his time on Grenada, figuring quite accurately that that was when he got the
                    8:30 call every morning from the National Security Council saying, what's
                    happened. His visibility rested much more on what happened on Grenada than
                    anywhere else. What was most controversial about it, is that the reasons we went
                    in with the invasion were threats to the life of the medical students, but also
                    because the Cubans were building this modern airport that they described as a
                    dagger pointed at the heart of the U.S. Well, in the first 18 months, we sent in
                    a report and said the most important economic thing to do was to finish the
                    airport. That the availability of direct links with the U.S. really controlled
                    any other thing they wanted to do in that country. As long as the only way to
                    get to Grenada was to go to Barbados overnight and take an island hopper, they
                    simply weren't going to get the kind of investment and development, etc. etc.
                    etc. So, we wound up finishing off the airport. By the time I got there, it was
                    like two or three years later, the emphasis in Grenada had—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what year was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: I was in Grenada from 1989 to 1990. By the time I came into the picture,
                    the emphasis that was on we have to show we made a difference in Grenada and
                    that the Cubans were bad guys and we were good guys had pretty much evaporated.
                    The RDO in Barbados was trying to reabsorb the island back in to the regional
                    infrastructure. The Ambassador on Grenada was trying to maintain a bilateral
                    staff and bilateral USAID program. The man who had been the Associate Director
                    had his new assignment somewhere in L.A. And, if you were headed down a path of
                    a eliminating the office, it didn't make sense to replace him, because you were
                    moving everything back to Barbados. On the other hand, if you were going to
                    maintain a separate office, then you needed to replace him. So, I was the
                    compromise candidate to go out on TDY. But, I had no dreams of being assigned to
                    that job, so that I wouldn't have any built in incentive to try and keep it on
                    the Ambassador's track.</p>
                <p>I knew the RDO Director in Barbados and he trusted me in that I would keep him
                    honestly informed as to what was going on. So, I spent a year in there,
                    (originally supposed to be a TDY of 60 days and they were going to make the
                    decision in 60 days.) A year later I was still out there, because they never
                    could make the decision. They would write briefing memos up through the USAID
                    structure, and from the USAID structure over to the State Department structure.
                    Meanwhile, the political desk officers on the State side were writing briefing
                    papers up to their guys and over to the other guys. Papers would go all the way
                    up to Secretary Eagleburger and we would get a cable saying, it's up in
                    Eagleburger's office, he'll decide in the next ten days and then two weeks later
                    we'd get a cable saying, Eagleburger had to go to Russia and he passed this down
                    to so and so who's going to have so and so take a look at it. It got nowhere. In
                    the meantime, Ford Cooper was the Ambassador, an excellent Ambassador. Despite
                    all of his pulling and tugging, the program gradually became a regional program.
                    The individual direct bilateral USAID projects began to phase out and in their
                    place were components of the regional effort so that you could tell the
                    Grenadians that the same amount of money was going to Grenada. The U.S.
                    government was not losing interest in Grenada and that USAID wasn't pulling out
                    and all the rest of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did we do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: It started out, like I say, the major effort was on the airport. Once
                    the airport was finished the major effort was to try and get American airlines
                    to fly direct so that you had a direct link between Grenada and the U.S. Ford
                    Cooper, the Ambassador, took a direct role in the negotiations where he would
                    call up the American airlines and say, OK. what do you need and they'd tell him,
                    well we need this amount of cargo space or this amount of radar control and a
                    tower or whatever. So, then he'd call up the Grenadian ministry and say, okay,
                    this is what you've got, now what are you planning on putting up there. Then he
                    called me and said, USAID put in a control tower. You know, he was the one who
                    was the spider, sort of at the center trying to pull everybody together to get a
                    functioning airport and he eventually did. The American airlines used Puerto
                    Rico as their hub for the entire Caribbean, so you couldn't get a flight
                    directly from New York to Grenada. You had to go to Puerto Rico and then to
                    Grenada; they felt that was better than having to go through Barbados. You also
                    ended up with American airlines essentially wanting a lot of guarantees and
                    concessions from the government, which in the initial years made it much more
                    profitable for American airline and less profitable for the government, in terms
                    of the government waiving its normal landing fee and whatever it was they
                    had.</p>
                <p>In addition to the airport, the major push was to try and get American investors
                    to come down and look at investing Grenada and so USAID organized a series of
                    hotel investors who came down and looked at the possibility of investing in
                    hotels. A couple of venture capitalists came down and looked at the possibility
                    of investing in anything. A couple of people came down who were actively
                    associated with cruise lines and wanted the government of Grenada to expand and
                    modernize the port at St. Georges so your bigger cruise ships could come
                    through. They had all the arguments about what a cruise ships with a growing
                    range for passenger traffic and a number of people, a number of visits, and this
                    was the way that Grenada should go in terms of the tourism.</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>Meantime, I was over in the corner causing trouble. First of all, I'm like the
                    cruise line investors and the guys who came down pushing that. I was telling the
                    government of Grenada to be careful, because, if they base their tourism on
                    cruise ships, essentially the cruise ship has no infrastructure requirements. If
                    you have a cruise ship, a cruise ship can go to any port and if there's a
                    problem with water facility to where your water tanks are contaminated in St.
                    Georges, you know, they just go to St. Lucia. There's another military coup or
                    political unrest in Grenada, you know. Why not go to Dominica. They have
                    absolutely no investment to stay there and work with the government. Hotel
                    investors, on the other hand do. They have an interest in putting up an
                    infrastructure; they've got a commitment; and they're going to stay with you for
                    the long haul. Plus, which may be less unpopular, so you look at Grenada,
                    there's something like four hundred thousand Grenadians on the island. There are
                    another four hundred thousand who were in Canada, Ballston, and the third place
                    in the Northeast. The Canadians outside the country were shipping funds into the
                    country so you had a major capital inflow coming from them where they would send
                    money for their uncle to start up a Bed and Breakfast, and their aunt to start a
                    little hamburger shop. And, for somebody else, this whole range of small scale
                    entrepreneur activity just growing like mad, being funded by the Grenadians
                    outside the country sending money home. This was far more in Grenada's interest
                    than being nice to Hilton Hotel and having a huge Hilton Hotel bill, which
                    wouldn't create the jobs; it wouldn't have the impact on the economy, and it
                    probably wasn't going to happen anyway, despite the fact that we kept seeing all
                    the hotel letters coming in. One of them actually was Doug Bennett, who had
                    moved to South Carolina and had some sort of intra capital program going and he
                    came down to Grenada on one of these investor tours. I think, in the USAID in
                    terms of organizing investment groups was really proactive and did more in
                    Grenada than any place else I've been, but I don't think the economic
                    climb-hanger in Grenada was right for the kind of things we were talking about
                    doing. Where we saw investments by Americans and these big scale things, just
                    didn't have the impact that all of the small scale investments of all the little
                    enterprises were having.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we doing any local projects?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: I had some training projects; I had an industrial project: what happened
                    was immediately after the invasion went in, they went for capital
                    infrastructure. So, they built an industrial warehouse park; they had built
                    roads all over the island; did community centers and schools, and it was the
                    Dixon Martyr (?ed) approach across the board. And, even continued that pretty
                    much. The preference of the investor self-help fund was for brick and mortar
                    activities. The classic example of the good and the bad, was that they talked
                    the Embassy into funding a two bedroom housing unit that would be adjacent to a
                    community health post. They couldn't convince the government to set up the
                    community health post, because the government didn't have a doctor to send
                    there, because there was no housing for a doctor when he got there. So, the
                    Ambassador talked to the investor on this self-help project of putting up this
                    two bedroom house and then they went on and started discussions with the
                    government to get a rural health post. And, once they got the rural health post
                    they started trying to get the doctor. Eventually, it wound up that it worked.
                    It all fit together, but it was not by any overall, up-front agreement, you
                    know, that if I do this, you do that or the idea is to put a fully staffed
                    health post here and we'll all work on our piece of it. It was local people
                    working on one piece at a time and it worked.</p>
                <p>One of the things when I was there that we were working on was to clear the
                    (USAID ed) warehouse out. So, we were doing donations to private volunteer
                    organizations, orphanages, and schools and clinics. One of the things that we
                    found in the warehouse were 20 signs, which were these big metal signs about the
                    size of this desk, which would be what, four by six, complete with the USAID
                    clasped hands and the red, white and blue insignia saying, welcome Ronald
                    Reagan, self -help project number 22 school. Or, self-help project 38 community
                    center. They were ordered and supposed to have been put up all over the island
                    before Reagan came down on his visit in '89, '88 and hadn't gotten there in
                    time. So, they had them all in the warehouse. So, I said, look you guys, it's a
                    shame they didn't get put up when Reagan came, but you spent the money and you
                    can't just leave them sitting in the warehouse, the auditors will kill us. We
                    have to show that we did something with them. So, Felix, our Health Advisor, you
                    know, why don't you start going around and making arrangements and we'll put
                    these up and if the communities wants to have a little ceremony we'll have the
                    Ambassador cut a ribbon or something. And Felix who had worked for USAID, but he
                    was then working for the Embassy, an extremely intelligent, talented young man
                    looked at me like I was crazy. He said, no. I said, what do you mean, no, we
                    have to put these up. Well, you wouldn't want to put them up. I said, why
                    wouldn't I want to put them up? He said, well all those places that we put up
                    that we were so proud of, they haven't been maintained, they need painting, they
                    need shingles put back on or shutters put back on. And, you couldn't have the
                    Ambassador go out and shake hands for this dilapidated project. You'd have to
                    put some more money into it before you could take it, you know, before it's a
                    good opportunity. I said, well think of something to do with these signs then.
                    So, what he decided to do with the signs, that since the self help program was
                    ongoing we'd use the signs for new programs where we'd put in a community
                    center, painted a school or something.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was welcoming Reagan on it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Do something with them. You couldn't hardly let them sit in the
                    warehouse. In the industrial park where we'd built the building and put it up
                    and put in the water works, we were also trying to set up within the industrial
                    site a child care center. We would also do baby wellness health activities. The
                    problem with that was that everybody agreed to do it, but nobody could find
                    appropriate funding, because you had the funds that were going into the
                    warehouse that were suppose to be for structural components; you had the funds
                    going in to the regional health projects which were suppose to provide
                    commodities, but they couldn't pay for salaries. I got involved in negotiating
                    with about three different people who were getting USAID funds for three
                    different reasons. How all three of them could work together to come out with
                    the child care center if everybody agreed was a good idea to do. It was probably
                    as illegal as hell, if an auditor ever came down and said, where did you put
                    this dollar, because we were meshing funds from all over the place.</p>
                <p>We also had a big push on trying to do eco-tourism. St. Georges itself is a
                    beautiful 17th century city built around a natural lagoon. It goes up the hill
                    to see just an incredible vista and there's a huge fort on one of the points of
                    the lagoon that had originally been built by the Spanish, conquered by the
                    French, conquered by the British, conquered by the French. You know, it sort of
                    changed hands two or three different times and was currently serving as the
                    headquarters for the national police. We began another project to clean it up,
                    reinforce the walls a couple of places, put in lighting, a electrical and
                    lighting system where it could be used for tourism. That was fun. It was
                    something that I don't think USAID would ever have done anywhere else. It was
                    actually being funded in Grenada under a regional project, where I don't know
                    that anybody else knew that we were even doing it until they came down there.
                    But, it was visually an extraordinary attractive site.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nothing in agriculture?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: A agriculturalist named Oleen Hess who is probably one of the world's
                    leading experts on cocoa was in Grenada working on a cocoa project as part of an
                    agriculture outreach effort working with farmers on the kinds of pesticides that
                    were best to use, and the things that he knew from working around the world in
                    cocoa projects, a different world. Cocoa made a lot of sense for an island
                    economy, because you didn't have refrigeration problems in terms of shipping and
                    exporting it. We were also working with a company known as “Island of Spices”,
                    because they produced so much cinnamon, vanilla, nutmeg, everything. One of the
                    things we brought down was McCormick's marketing expert. Got him to come down to
                    the country and take a trip around seeing all the different spices that could be
                    sold by McCormick and offer them easy relationships at a time when our existing
                    relationships in Madagascar were rocking. So, McCormick was interested in
                    developing other sources of supply, and they came down and reluctantly said they
                    just couldn't do it because it was a too small scale operation, in terms of
                    McCormick's bottling plant, grinding factory, etc. that Grenada just couldn't
                    ship enough every single month. So, that one fell through.</p>
                <p>But, then they had some Grenadians go to a spice, I don't know, for high tech
                    you'd call it a tech fair. I don't know what you call it for food and spices.
                    But, they basically had a booth at a food and spices thing where they wound up
                    making marketing arrangements with a couple of very small gourmet, organic food
                    types of restaurants and grocery stores. So, they were increasing their exports
                    in agriculture and in cocoa. We were working on the actual health practices and
                    harvesting mechanisms. On the other hand, we worked more on the terms of trying
                    to set up private sector contacts and to provide the government of Grenada with
                    what information we could about world prices, world marketing, what kind of
                    environment did they face when they were trying to market their products. I
                    thoroughly enjoyed it, because it was a solid year that I spent doing
                    implementation. We weren't talking about new projects, you weren't talking about
                    strategy, you weren't talking about where do we go from here. It was just making
                    sure that what's there works well and somebody figures out where you go in the
                    long run.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The projects worked. I think it was that Floyd Cooper just could not
                    convince his State Department colleagues to hold the line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were the last USAID person?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Last USAID person. I ended up closing out the USAID Office. We gave the
                    telephone equipment systems switchboard to Lacenia Jordon up in Guyana and gave
                    most of the office furniture to PVO's and other people around the island. I had
                    the pleasure of working with one of the best, most knowledgeable and trained
                    people I've ever worked with was the Executive Officer in Grenada. He had
                    started life with USAID when he was 16, straight out of high school in Guyana.
                    He worked his way up through the whole USAID hierarchical management system and
                    became the GSO and Exec Officer. He closed down Guyana; he was in Jonestown. He
                    was in charge of the evacuation of the bodies from the Jonestown crisis. He ends
                    up closing down USAID Guyana when we pulled out of Guyana; opened up a Grenada
                    office. In the midst of the Grenada assignment, he got pulled out to Panama to
                    close down the Panama Office, because the Mission Director knew Carl Cullus and
                    had full faith that Cullus could handle it, even though Cullus had no Spanish.
                    From everything I heard he did a superb job. He got rid of all the furniture;
                    closed down the office; found jobs for the employees. From Grenada he went over
                    to Barbados and was the GSO over Barbados and then later I heard that he went
                    back to Guyana when we opened up the USAID Office in Guyana. Anyway, he read
                    more books. He knew every single rule and regulation on the administrative
                    office side and what I could and couldn't do in terms of record keeping and all
                    the rest of it for closing out the projects and closing the office down. The
                    Grenadians were most unhappy. They saw closing the office as closing the USAID
                    program. No matter how much PR, we did about the amount of money, would change
                    their view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we keep going with our assistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The entire RDO Caribbean budget was getting cut, so less and less aid
                    was available, so there was less and less for Grenada. And then, RDO Caribbean
                    got caught in Brian Atwood closing down a small programs. So, essentially they
                    did see the writing on the wall. Their point was that when the U.S. came in...
                    the first time I was there, I got in a taxi from the airport and said something
                    about the invasion. The taxi cab driver stopped, pulled off the road, turned
                    around and gave me a lecture. It was not a U.S. invasion; it was a U.S. rescue
                    mission and the troops came down to rescue the Grenadians. And, as a side light
                    they helped out the medical students, but it was really like an antique what
                    those marines came to save, because they had been under a 24 hour curfew for a
                    week. The driver objected to me calling it an invasion. So, it sort of reflected
                    everybody in the country and the government. We always saw the U.S. as having
                    come down there to save them. And, as a corollary of that, they really thought
                    that when the U.S. left that Grenada should be like Puerto Rico and that was
                    their definition of success, to be like Puerto Rico. And, the USAID projects we
                    worked on worked, but there wasn't a turn around. It was not a massive program,
                    you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean we were not prepared to take it on as a
                        commonwealth country?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Perpetual client. We weren't prepared to adopt it as part of the
                    commonwealth. And, the Grenadians felt very much betrayed that we weren't
                    sticking to the course, that we weren't staying with it. So, I closed down the
                    USAID Office and left. They were not happy campers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It was in July of '90.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I'd never been any place where Americans were not more popular than
                    Grenada. They really and truly appreciated the fact that Ronald Reagan had sent
                    the troops down. They did not feel that it was an invasion. They felt that the
                    troops came to save them and they went out of their way to express appreciation
                    to any American, tourist, government official, or what have you. At the same
                    time, they were bitterly disappointed, because they felt that by coming down
                    there that America had more or less adopted the island and why didn't we turn it
                    in to another Puerto Rico and that Puerto Rico was their symbol for success in
                    the Caribbean.</p>

                <p>JOHNSON: Yeah, I was there then. I was there '88. So, it's been 10 years now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Have you been back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Never been back. I understand that American airlines no longer flies
                    directly to Grenada, because there weren't enough people to warrant their
                    trip.Again I was on temporary assignment to Grenada while the State Department
                    and USAID sorted out what they wanted to do about having a staff there.
                    Eventually, they pulled all the staff out of Grenada and centralized it in the
                    Regional Development Office. Essentially, the year that I was in Grenada, the
                    State Department and the USAID went back and forth with policy papers as to
                    whether you needed an independent USAID Office in the Grenada, or whether
                    everything could be handled efficiently and effectively out of the Regional
                    Office of Barbados.</p>
                <p>They sent memos back and forth and they'd get up to Eagleburger and he'd send
                    them back and say, work it out. Then, nobody could ever work it out. So, then
                    finally after I'd been there a year, it was clear that they weren't going to be
                    independent and so they phased out the USAID Office and I went back to
                    Washington;</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about some of these other assignments? You talked
                        about management assessments, what were those?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I forget now if it was under Woods or the subsequent USAID
                    Administrator, his name I can't even remember now, but they did a lot of
                    delegations to the field, in terms of increasing the responsibility and autonomy
                    of the field posts. There was an intellectual or logical feeling that if you
                    delegated the responsibility, there was a need to find some way to measure
                    accountability and that you needed to undertake some type of program as to how
                    well did the field use its delegation to authority. Different Bureaus handled it
                    different ways in terms of trying to do mission assessments. The overall general
                    thrust was that it was supposed to be a management tool so that your team
                    assessment would go only to the Assistant Administrator in the Bureau. It would
                    not become public if you will, for other people to pick on the programs. So, it
                    was seen as an internal report, and it was seen as something that worked.</p>
                <p>I guess I did management assessment in Somali with Ray Love heading up the team.
                    I did management assessments in the Latin America Bureau where we had three
                    countries and (?), I can't even think of his last name now, he was a Latin
                    America hand, head of the Latin America DP Office. He headed up the team, in
                    both places, in Samoa and in Latin America. We went in with open ended questions
                    for the Mission Director. What can we do that will help you? What problems do
                    you want to identify that you want to bring as a management issue? What problems
                    do you want to identify that we can take back and report to the AA, what have
                    you, you know, back at the fort? So, they tried to keep it from being a witch
                    hunt type of inspection program. It was seen as a collegial effort where you
                    recognized that an awful lot of the problems were long distance communications
                    and that these teams then served as a way of breaking up some of those
                    communication problems, being interactive and all of the rest of it. My only
                    experience with it was in Samoa and in Latin America, as that nothing was done
                    with the reports after they were done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the main issues raised?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Let me see if I can remember. In Somalia, it was internal management of
                    the USAID Office there. It had grown from a five to a seven person initial USAID
                    office to where you had over 30 Americans and probably over 50 to 80 local
                    hires; they had set up a compound. It turned into a big operation. The problem
                    was, that despite having such a big operation in everything actually, it didn't
                    work. So, if you wanted a message sent over to the UNDP Director you sent a car
                    and a driver with a message. That staffing and organizing the logistical support
                    needed to overcome the basic limits of the society, just pushed the Embassy and
                    most of the donors up to their limits and meant having large USAID support
                    staffs there when you really didn't have that large of an USAID Program. You had
                    primarily technical assistance, which the Somalis welcomed, but it wasn't what
                    they really wanted. What they really wanted was for us to come in and build
                    dams, build roads, put in the country infrastructure. The mission management
                    assessment was that the USAID office had essentially very low productivity,
                    simply because they were trying to operate in an environment which didn't
                    sustain any efforts. That was a conclusion; it wasn't a recommendation that you
                    could do much about, other than it offered some defense if later PPC and OMB
                    wanted to cut the numbers of people there and got into the perpetual game of how
                    come two people can deliver X million here and it takes 20 people to do Y
                    million there. What we came back with in the Management Assessment turned out to
                    be useful ammunition for why it takes more people in some places.</p>
                <p>The only substantive issue I can remember was the PL480 Program. The feeling was
                    that the PL480 Program should be cut way back. It had had too great an impact on
                    Somalia's life and was essentially being worked into the system where it was
                    common practice that as the men and young boys would take the herds out, the
                    women, old people, and children would go to the refugee camps and depend upon
                    the food provided by the donors. They were no longer refugee camps, they were
                    permanent settlements. That one was a hot political potato that nobody could do
                    anything with.</p>
                <p>In Peru, the Management Assessment had to deal with the practice at that time of
                    having a USAID Officer handle Uruguay and Peru. He was stationed in Peru and he
                    also handled Uruguay. It had all of the problems that I was familiar with from
                    having worked with the regional programs in Africa and South Pacific, that the
                    way they were set up was a universal constraint, you can't be in two countries
                    at the same time.</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>In Brazil, the USAID Office there was responsible for one of the largest programs
                    in the world in family planning, where the U.S. provided the contraceptives; it
                    was a commodity drop, like the old commodity import programs. However you want
                    to put it, we were putting large commodity assistance into Brazil. We had a
                    policy statement from USAID saying that we would not do commodity drops in
                    Brazil, because Brazil was an advanced development country and had foreign
                    exchange of its own. What we would provide should come from within a selected
                    list, a more limited list of technical assistance, trying to establish
                    connections with American Universities, scientific, blah, blah, blah. Our major
                    program was a commodity drop and no one was prepared to either acknowledge that
                    the policy needed to be changed. If you wanted to do the commodity drop and the
                    reasons for it in terms of family planning, world-wide issues were so
                    constrained, then go ahead and just change the policy and say that you're going
                    to do it. No one wanted that option, because they felt that it would open the
                    door to too many other countries that really wanted foreign exchange support.
                    Changing the policy for the family planning program was not considered a
                    desirable option, because Brazil was the largest country in the Southern
                    hemisphere, had major population problems; it was considered a leader in what it
                    would permit family planning organizations to do. So, our management assessment
                    team had absolutely no impact that I could ever tell on that particular issue of
                    policy going in one direction and practice going in another. The USAID family
                    planning office in Brazil was one American who had a local hired staff of about
                    three or four people and worked primarily through PVO's or the organizationally
                    equivalence of indigenous PVO's and indigenous equivalence of the Ford
                    Foundation where someone would set up a local foundation to handle X, Y or Z.
                    Primarily the program was family planning in conjunction with some health
                    activities and some public education activities, but mainly it was providing the
                    condoms.</p>
                <p>They were beginning to get active in democracy programs, primarily by sending
                    Brazilians to the States to attend seminars. They were trying to get involved in
                    environmental issues with the Amazon Rain Forest. The USAID Mission had no
                    support from the Embassy for getting involved in that area. It had very limited
                    support from Washington; i.e. environmental specialists, but nobody else in
                    program or policy area, and limited money that they could throw at the
                    issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did Management Assessments come up with the issues,
                        did you identify issues that you felt were real problems that hadn't been
                        raised that you felt needed attention?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No. The problems were already known. It was not in any sense a Sherlock
                    Homes investigation trip.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, sometimes Mission staff were not open on issues</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: To a little extent, not much. That happened in Somalia where people
                    wanted to come up and whisper in your ear and say, I can really tell you the
                    true story. But, for the most part, the issues were already really known. They
                    weren't surprised at either the USAID Office or the Embassy. More than anything
                    else, it was a chance to get the issue out in the open and on the table and a
                    document where presumably people would have to deal with it. Although, I found
                    that they had been working on dealing with it. It was something like, in Brazil
                    the USAID Officer had been trying to push for environmental participation,
                    because of the rain forest in the Amazon. He had simply been slapped down by
                    Washington, saying, you're in too many fields, you're trying to do too many
                    things, concentrate on your contraceptive program and don't worry about the
                    rest. I started feeling that the USAID Officer was somebody in country who
                    talked to people about development issues, then felt we should be willing to
                    participate in trying to work out an answer, even if that only amounted to call
                    on someone from Army Corp of Engineers, who was knew what happened in the
                    Western United States in terms of damming up rivers and setting up water control
                    programs and then 20 years later, what was the impact of having done that.
                    Getting people like that to come down and participate in working groups or
                    seminars with Brazilians who were facing those same kinds of issues.</p>
                <p>Again, in Somalia, Ray Love participated as a team leader. He was the Deputy
                    Assistant Administrator for Africa, and in Latin America, ? who was head of the
                    Policy and Planning Office participated. The Assessments served a really good
                    purpose, sensitizing Senior Bureau Personnel to what was going on in quote,
                    “better missions.” I think that was probably the most useful thing it did. In
                    most cases, it did not turn up surprises.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was anything done with the reports?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No. By practice and by policy a report was given to the Assistant
                    Administrator for that geographic area and then distributed throughout the
                    Bureau as he so determined. So, there was no automatic distribution. The Latin
                    America Bureau always had somebody from the geographic office on the team, so
                    the geographic back stop essentially had a copy and they knew what was being
                    argued. The African Bureau, I'm not sure, but I think that we had a policy that
                    we gave a copy of the report to the Mission Director and to the Office Director
                    for that geographic area. Other than that it went to the Assistant
                    Administrator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to the delegation of authority process?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Not much. I think the L.A. Bureau, probably being the most structured
                    Bureau, had a fairly elaborate system for how they were going to follow up on
                    the delegations of authority. I remember being told about it, but I don't know
                    that I ever saw one internal study that they did.. At that time, the field
                    offices were to send in proposed projects in the form of a document called a
                    PID. Then, Washington would approve the project concept, lay out a number of
                    areas that they wanted to make sure that the final project analysis covered, and
                    then the Mission Director would have final authority for the project.</p>
                <p>A LA Bureau study of 20 PIDs on how they related to the final project paper and
                    contract scope of work found no relationship in those 20 incidences; that the
                    project paper in terms of the PID would have a basic concept or an idea of what
                    area to get involved in. But, most of what they identified in the PID were the
                    avenues that they would work on, but when they did the project paper analysis.
                    they turned out to be either ineffective or low priority areas and you should
                    work somewhere else. So, the Project Paper would still work on the same problem,
                    but in other ways it would be very different from what was originally approved.
                    The process then of taking a project paper and turning it in to a scope of work
                    for a contract team, also then involved another generation of growth and change.
                    The contractors frequently had never seen the original project paper, much less
                    the PID. By the time the project had boiled down to capsules of paragraphs that
                    would go into a Congressional Presentation on what the project was about, by the
                    time you whittled a hundred page document down to two paragraphs, it read very
                    close to what the PID would read like. The project would have the same title and
                    the same name and functionally be in the same function area, but, at the same
                    time, it would also be very different. I think Congress frequently thought of it
                    as USAID not be trustworthy. They would go out on field trips and they would get
                    their briefings before they went and then they would look at the projects after
                    they got there. There was much variation in the normal evolution of a project
                    from the impact of the people involved would have on it. Your PID would be
                    written by one set of people; your Project Paper by another set of people, and
                    your contract team was a third set of people. The project mostly became how the
                    contractors thought it should be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your view of that process?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: You could never run a control say in a sense of having two projects and
                    one be the project that did what the PID said all the way through and the other
                    would be the project that normally evolved and then compare the end results with
                    a traditionally scientific method. It just wouldn't work. They were always
                    trying to figure out what if's and maybe's, the peer speculation on what would
                    have been different if we had done something different. I don't think there is a
                    way to assess the relative impact of what two different projects would have been
                    if they had been X, Y or Z. There are too many variables. Keith Sherper (from
                    the Africa Bureau and later Agency Councilor) use to argue that every project
                    that USAID did was a new project, because it was done in a different country
                    with a different set of host country characters, with a different set of USAID
                    Mission characters. So, it was the first time for everyone and held out little
                    hope for lessons learned or transferability of knowledge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you think about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: First, I thought it was simplicity to the point of being unreal. When I
                    thought about it, I thought well, he actually has a point that, okay, it's the
                    first time a project has ever been done in this country with this set of host
                    government characters and this set of American advisors. At the same time, the
                    American advisors were bringing to that project all the lessons that they've
                    learned, either from reading or participating in other similar efforts. So,
                    there is carryover in terms of having a professionally trained group of people
                    who work with host governments and probably where USAID made its worst mistake
                    was when it went from providing technical assistance directly to doing
                    contractor assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Your contractor assistance in many, many cases is excellent, but it is
                    not, as a rule provided by people who see that as a professional career. Nyles
                    Brady use to talk about it (he was head of the Science and Technology Bureau).
                    His view was that if you wanted to be an international expert on corn, you
                    didn't go work for USAID, you went to work for one of the international centers
                    that had research on corn. Then, if you needed him in any particular effort to
                    help the corn center in Bangladesh, you would hire him and he would come out and
                    he would help provide the corn assistance. The technical, scientific base
                    assistance is often the least important component in why our projects succeeded.
                    The most important thing as to whether our projects succeeded or failed was who
                    in the host government worked on it and what their agenda was. And, did their
                    agenda match the government's agenda in terms of what they thought they wanted
                    to accomplish. Then, the second variable that would be critical would be the
                    technical assistance team. It wasn't a case of us funding a corn team to go out
                    and do corn research, as much as our funding a team that would go out and help
                    that government build the capacity to adapt and utilize research that was coming
                    out of the corn centers, or coming out of other areas. And, that I think does
                    require the experience that comes from people doing that in three or four
                    different countries. We lost a lot of that when we stopped using direct hire. I
                    think in the last four or five years they've tried to recoup it by hiring back
                    into the Agency, people who had been effective, you know, those who had tried
                    it. They were affiliated with the university or something and they went out and
                    they did it and they liked it and USAID talked them into coming on board USAID
                    as a direct hire. Because, USAID's own internal hiring mechanisms were so
                    screwed up, frequently, the only way to bring somebody in was in the IDI
                    Program, which was the International Development Intern Program. When I came it
                    had an average age of 24 and the last average age I heard quoted was 42, where
                    essentially you weren't bringing in interns, even though they were newly hired
                    to the Agency, you were bringing in career people with solid technical
                    accomplishments. So, I think the Agency needed that group of people. It was
                    unfortunate that the only way then to tap into that resource was through another
                    program which also would have provided people for the Agency to use.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. It destroyed the IDI Program.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, destroyed the IDI Program. I think it resulted in a real
                    professional gap of about eight years, which was then a disaster. They did it by
                    the RIF in '97 (the Reduction in Force process, ed). I use to think when I was
                    an Office Director and I would talk to other Office Directors or Mission
                    Directors: I said, do you feel like the adults have all gone home and left the
                    children in charge of the play pens. Because, there were all these people that I
                    considered compatriots of mine that were still young and that all of the adults
                    had left and that we were in charge of the programs. But, then the (Assistant
                    Administrator for Management, ed) came along and wiped out what he considered to
                    be the old dinosaurs and now I go back in to USAID and I look at people who are
                    Officers and I feel ancient. It's not the group that was ten years behind me,
                    but it's the group that was 25 years behind me.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you think the capacity of the Agency has deteriorated
                        a lot?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The knowledge basis has deteriorated. The experience level that let's
                    you say, “look I know that got tried before in these three countries and it
                    didn't work for these five reasons. So, don't develop a project based exactly on
                    what failed over here unless you know for sure why it failed and why this is
                    going to be different.” I think that kind of perspective has been lost.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Along, with an attitude that they weren't really
                        interested in what happened before, others' experience, or did you find that
                        there was some interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Intellectually, you would talk to people and get some interest, but my
                    reaction is, I never felt that the people that came in with Clinton were serious
                    about development. That was my capsule that these are not serious people. And,
                    that in a 10 to 20 minute conversation, yeah, I think you get into really
                    interesting conversations about the need for history and perspective and all the
                    rest of it. Walk out the door and it walks with you. There was no follow up, if
                    you will. I felt very much, I guess it was the four years that Carter was in
                    that I felt that there was a collegial, a real sharing of professional goals
                    between overseas people, Washington people, and political appointees. They
                    didn't always agree. Fight their heads off tooth and nail, but there was a
                    community of interest as to what you wanted to accomplish.</p>
                <p>The eight years with Reagan and the four years with Bush, the Agency did better
                    in terms of money than it did anytime I was there, when Reagan set up the fire
                    wall between the military defense national security side of the budget and the
                    domestic side of the budget. USAID was by definition included in on national
                    security defense military. So, our budgets went up very well. McPherson was
                    probably the best Administrator that I worked for, just in terms of having a
                    logic or a thought process in back of what he wanted the Agency to be or become.
                    I think with the Republicans there was a strong bent that it took time before
                    that became reasonable. When they first came in, I would consider it irrational.
                    I remember the first time I ever met McPherson, I was East Africa Geographic
                    Office Director. We had disasters in Ethiopia; we had disasters in Tanzania; we
                    had disasters in Sudan, and so I went down in his office one Saturday.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It was me and McPherson and whoever at that time was the head of OFDA
                    who I don't remember, and Fred Schick was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From Latin America?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes. And, there were other hangers on. I don't remember who was there.
                    But, I remember Fred trying to explain to McPherson Company how USAID had
                    always, that when disasters happened, USAID helped, that we didn't really draw a
                    line between the Cold War boundaries, etc. etc. etc. and he said, we've always
                    helped in disasters. McPherson looked at him and said, that's before we were
                    here. And, took a very strong ideological viewpoint as to whether we should
                    provide assistance to communist leaning countries like Ethiopia. Eventually, the
                    publicity in Ethiopia just got so horrendous that the Agency, became a massive
                    donor.</p>
                <p>Back to what I was saying, that McPherson had a sense of what he wanted the
                    Agency to do in an organizational logic that went through it. I think the
                    subsequent years where Alan Woods was Administrator, but essentially was sick
                    most of the time and had very poor relations with his own deputy and so he
                    wouldn't really delegate to the deputy. He tried to delegate around the deputy
                    to the regional AA's and then Roskins who had basically had no interest in
                    anything other than taking photo opportunity trips as far as I could tell. But
                    Roskins saw delegations of authority as a way of getting things out of his
                    office where he didn't have to deal with them. So, you wound up with a lot of
                    things being delegated to the Regional Bureaus and to the Missions for a variety
                    of reasons. The idea of accountability that was built in the first delegation,
                    which I think was with McPherson, was McPherson wanted to make sure that people
                    still did what he wanted them to do. So, he wanted a feed bank system that would
                    tell you what's happening out there. Most of the other administrators and AA's
                    who wound up delegating things as the years went by talked about accountability,
                    but it was more in an accounting sense of making sure where the money went,
                    rather than, did people make the right development choices, did they push the
                    right sectors, etc. etc. I think out of 30 years with USAID, I've seen three
                    Mission Directors fired. And, all three of them were fired for things that were
                    considered misuse of operating expense money, you know, individual personally
                    life style issues. Nobody got fired from making the wrong development
                    choice.</p>
                <p>The idea was that Mission Assessments would be used as internal management tools
                    between the missions and the Bureaus, that they worked to improve communications
                    and people knew more about what someone was doing, but I never saw that one
                    really led to follow up actions that said something should change. Now,
                    admittedly in the L.A. Bureau, I didn't have a follow up role and in the Africa
                    Bureau I had more of a follow up role, because I was working there. At that time
                    when we did the Somalia Assessment, I had been Office Director of East Africa
                    and I was Office Director of Development Planning and I did not see that it
                    resulted in any follow up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. What else did you do besides Management
                        Assessment?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: I worked with John Koehring (Head of Development Resources, Africa
                    Bureau, ed) when he did a major evaluation to come to a recommendation on the
                    appropriate relationship or ratio between the size of the USAID Mission staffing
                    and the size of the country program and how that related to a delegation of
                    authority. It became known as the In-country Study and was supposed to take
                    three months and ended up taking nine months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did it take so long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Because there were so many variables involved and the original thrust
                    that this was going to be the study to end all studies. Previous studies of the
                    same kinds of problems on mission size and program size had been undertaken, but
                    no one had ever taken, undertaken a world-wide study using all the variables.
                    And, simply because it had been an issue for so long there were innumerably past
                    studies that had been done on individual countries or comparisons to Kenya and
                    Tanzania or comparison with Mexico, which was an advanced developing country and
                    now another Agency. There was a lot of material. It was a large team John
                    Koehring, Ed Hogan, who was Director of DP, the Dick Blue, who was at that time
                    at the Center for College Studies, and had previously run the PPC's assessment
                    office, Peter Askin (former USAID Director) was part of it, Rosemary Delp (later
                    head of Personnel) was part of it, Victor Moldrun (ph). Rosemary Delp at that
                    time was liaison, Vic Moldrun was head of the Policy from the PPC Bureau, ex
                    Mission Director, Byron Ball, ex Mission Director, Herb Miller, and me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a talented group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, it was talented, but it was way to big. For everybody in USAID, the
                    ultimate career success is being a Mission Director. When you are a Mission
                    Director it's frequently you're like a god, because you're trained in
                    everything, and if you want this, it happens, you know, it just works well.
                    Then, you have all these people who came back to Washington as ex-Mission
                    Directors and they have a real hard time learning how to be ex-gods. So, we had
                    a team proposal, a very bright, very talented people, all of whom had been
                    holding senior jobs for a fairly long time. And, all of them had their own ideas
                    of how you should run a mission program. Essentially, the study that was finally
                    produced was very well received by ?, who accounted it remarkable that USAID
                    produced such a critical study and was willing to admit in public to as many of
                    the things that would be insane about it, in terms of staffing and how decisions
                    were made and just how the whole system worked. It was fairly well received in
                    Congress, but it quickly became another study that went on a shelf that didn't
                    get very much use.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was its main conclusion about overseas missions?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: That overseas missions were critical to affecting development. You could
                    not do development at long distance, because you had to work with host
                    government officials to make it work and that your chances of having something
                    that was sustainable, which was a big issue at that time, your chance of having
                    something sustainable increased to the extent that you worked in-country and you
                    had a chance to meet and know and support key people in the host government.</p>
                <p>The major factor affecting size of mission should be the development competence
                    of the country that you're in. And in the analysis the only thing that really
                    related (staffing to program) was the length of time the mission had existed.
                    So, your bigger missions tended to be those who had been in place in stable
                    environments for a fairly long time. The Philippines is one example, and then
                    Latin America and Panama. As the years passed, new mission programs always
                    tended to have fewer staff. And, because of the nature of new programs, it
                    always looked on paper that if two people can move 20 million dollars here, why
                    does it take 20 people over there?</p>
                <p>The study did not find a way to really analyze the relationships and say that it
                    looks like small staffs can move large amounts of money in the early days of the
                    program, and then speculate on combined opinion why that was true, because
                    during the early days of the program were emergency assistance and commodity
                    assistance, as well as over time as the program became larger you got involved
                    in more complex issues. The New Directions was cited as one reason why there was
                    a need for more USAID people overseas in the field, you know, sort of a
                    potpourri. CDIE which had been a sponsor of the study did take it and put out
                    the conclusion as a general guideline of here's what to think about when you're
                    staffing a mission, but we recognized that individual circumstances may dictated
                    an answer and so everybody was pretty diverse what they wanted to for staffing
                    size.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There certainly should have been a relationship between
                        the requirements for staff and the complexity of the program, first in terms
                        of whether it was non-project assistance or project assistance and then
                        whether it was multi-sector or focused?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No sir.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: No, because what you had you see were people with different experiences
                    and different life experiences, if you will. They would argue that for a
                    Economic Support program, which would involve a lot of either budget support or
                    commodity import program, that if those were to have the impact that you wanted,
                    you still needed in-country staff economists; you had experts on exports,
                    tariffs, taxes who could help with a problem on occasion with that kind of
                    assistance. So you might wind up with tax specialists and legal reform and
                    tariff and customs specialists, whereas on a different kind of program you might
                    need agricultural advisors, health advisors and what have you. But, to have the
                    impact you wanted you needed the people. You couldn't relate different kinds of
                    assistance that well to staff size. We had some countries where we were putting
                    millions and millions and millions of dollars into a country with like two
                    people, Brazil, which essentially was a commodity drop, we were providing
                    condoms. And, you had some other examples in another geographic bureau.</p>
                <p>But, at that time, the early '90s when we did the study, essentially Koehring
                    came out with a recommendation that every Mission should have a Core Staff and
                    they identified what the types of the Core Staff would be. And, then you could
                    bring on other exports as needed, depending upon the task of the program, etc.
                    etc. The Program Office people like it, because the Program Officer was one of
                    the designated critical staff. The Project Officer people liked it, because the
                    Project Officer was one of the staff. The Controllers were also needed staff. I
                    forget about the Executive Officer whether or not, I think the Executive
                    Officers were core staff too.</p>
                <p>Although the study did not endorse nor did it say that everybody else could be
                    hired by contract, that's what people read it as saying. That your USAID
                    Officers became your generalists, your overhead management people and that
                    everybody else you could get on contract as needed, technical people, including
                    economists as technical people, which drove the economists crazy. To me, in 1961
                    a number of agencies were integrated that dealt with foreign assistance. I
                    showed up in 1967 and it was clear that there were separate streams of people.
                    The personnel system was treating each one as a separate category of people.
                    Each one had a career development scheme that was their own, had their own
                    mentors, if you will. And, essentially over 30 years, I didn't see that change
                    that drastically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was changed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: In your technical assistance, which went back to the old Point Four days
                    and the Truman era, you had TA project assistance, capital project assistance,
                    which went back to the Development Loan Fund. You had food assistance, which
                    went back to, I guess it's early days of the Marshall Plan in Europe, where it
                    was seen that the U.S. had surplus food and the world was hungry and this was
                    the mechanism for doing it. Then, you had a separate category of people, food
                    aid specialists, who worried about what was the legislative background, what
                    were the administrative rules, how did you move food aid. So, you had technical
                    assistance, capital assistance, food assistance, and then program assistance,
                    which essentially were economists who wanted to really moved capital associated
                    with large policy reforms that would get all the policies straight. Each of
                    those different groups had some career path of what you did, and how you got
                    trained, and what you were supposed to know and what you weren't supposed to
                    know. Over the last 30 years, more rather than less, it has become both a career
                    objective as well as a necessity for people to take tours in the other areas so
                    that a Program Officer would work in a combined program/project office where
                    your office director would be a program officer and your deputy officer would be
                    a project officer. And, the next time around, the project officer would be the
                    director and you have a program officer as deputy. People became more use to
                    working and understanding what the rules and regulations were for the other
                    kinds of assistance. Over time, the other kinds of assistance became subject to
                    the same rules and regulations. If Congress and lawyers tried to iron out
                    inconsistency so you, if you knew the rules and regulations on capital
                    assistance, you also pretty much knew technical assistance and program
                    assistance. There were some individual pieces of paper that you had to learn.
                    So, the combined program/project type of program, I think is pretty much still
                    evolving.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the application?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Again, the circumstances got filtered through everyone's own personal
                    experience. There were parts of the report that could be used to support a wide
                    variety of the different approaches. I think in hindsight, it was started wrong,
                    it was aimed wrong. I didn't really figure that out until I was in Madagascar
                    two years later. Mary Norris, who was then the Program Economist in Madagascar
                    got another cable from Washington saying, you know I wonder how come it takes 30
                    people in Madagascar to deliver blah, blah, blah. And starting all the questions
                    all over again about ratio, the program staff, the project size, the program
                    size, and so Mary Norris brought it in to me and she wanted me to help her with
                    it and I said sure, it's an issue that I'm familiar with. Then, she pointed out
                    something that I had never even thought about, but I think she hit it right on
                    the mark, is that in the whole context of managing inputs versus managing
                    outputs, that all of the controversy in all the years of study had always looked
                    at how you manage the inputs and can you relate the size of your staff to the
                    dollar magnitude of the inputs. And, no you can't, because it's the outputs,
                    that's what you're really looking to have. And, in a country like Madagascar
                    where you have seven people and then you have 20 million dollars, you're looking
                    for a different kind of impact and in Eritrea where you have one person and 50
                    million dollars. And, that all of the studies that had been done had really
                    focused on looking how you manage the dollar inputs which is the bean counter,
                    the green eyeshade view, all of that, where did the dollars go and what did they
                    buy. And, that in affect where USAID had, well the overseas concept of having
                    people overseas seems to have been bought by everyone. All of the literature out
                    right now, Atwood and all the policy statements, even the griping from Congress,
                    all agree that you need people overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And now the World Bank.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: And, the World Bank is now leaning that way too, so be it. I know when
                    we started the NIS Program (Newly Independent States-Eastern Europe ed.), the
                    question was whether or not since we were working with countries that were far
                    beyond the advanced country level they didn't need in-house people. Once again,
                    we needed in-house people. We don't hear really gripes about that anymore. I
                    think people still raise the question of why the staffing is so different in
                    different countries and try to correlate that with the program inputs, and that
                    what everybody use to do is take a big breath and step backward and try to
                    correlate with outputs. I don't know if Mary's kid will ever get anybody down
                    that line or not. That's one I push in terms of talking with people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A key factor that made that possible was confidence in the
                        government and therefore, its ability to affect the outputs, because you
                        could turn over the implementation (inputs) to a confident government— a
                        very decisive factor. Anyway, that's very interesting. So, what did you do
                        after that study?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: After that I'd been directed to work with the Eurasia Program. The Asia
                    Bureau didn't know what to call it, because calling it the Former Soviet Union
                    sounded like Florida State University (FSU). The State Department wanted to call
                    it the Soviet Independent States Program (SIS) in hopes that you would have a
                    consolidated type of federation with all of the Russian countries still staying
                    under one government. So, they were still insisting on having that reality show
                    up in the names we gave to our staff program and our project. This was '92, '93.
                    when I went to work in the Asia Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Let's get to that first then.JOHNSON: The
                        Development Planning Office in the Asia Bureau. They were reorganizing the
                        Asia Bureau to put Asia and Private Enterprise Bureau together. They had a
                        whole reorganization scheme to go with it. One of the functions with the DP
                        Office was supposed to be able to somehow make that a happy marriage, a
                        collaboration of interest. In fact, it was a tribute to the Assistant
                        Administrator for the Private Enterprise Bureau, who was an ineffective
                        lady. They wanted her to have a broader exposure to program content and
                        impact on the Asia Bureau and so she insisted that she bring her private
                        enterprise experts with her. There was also a lot of feeling that Asia was
                        an area in which private enterprise stood a better chance of moving out as a
                        major theme in some of the more advanced countries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your view of the Private Enterprise Bureau
                        function and what they were trying to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The AA never supported me, I would go with him to the big meeting and
                    everybody would talk about private sector initiatives and how we can be bold and
                    take risks and move out in this area, and I would be the person to say, look,
                    when you start talking about this, it sounds like you're talking about Mike
                    Milligan's Junk Bonds; every scam that's ever been run. You ought to be just a
                    lot more careful in terms of what you try and do and how you try and do it. The
                    thing was, I was the conservative one in the crowd of saying that the Agency had
                    a lot of experience with private enterprise programs. The Africa Bureau had an
                    Office of Private Enterprise back in the '60s. We had private enterprise
                    programs, and private initiatives, and a whole bag of history of involvement
                    with the private sector. People ought to be more familiar with the fact that it
                    existed, as well as be more sensitive to the fact that, there are things that
                    happen in the private sector that you ought to be able to know exists, even if
                    you don't want to face the total implications. Case and point.</p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>Large amounts of money were being generated for the private sector in the
                    Caribbean going into investments in hotels, in airports, training companies,
                    etc. There was a very strong feeling that most of the money was generated by the
                    drug traffic and was being laundered for investment in the private sector. And
                    USAID was being associated with the drug traffic. There's just a whole range of
                    scams and possibilities for corruption that you get involved in when you hit the
                    private sector. The normal course of business doesn't happen in government
                    transactions. Or, if they do have any government transactions, they are clearly
                    illegal and you can trace it to somebody and they get fired or in prison or
                    whatever. The private sector is a very tricky place in which to work. I also
                    helped start the U.S. presidential initiative on the environmental for Asia,
                    which was, based on what I'd seen the people do in the South Pacific on
                    environmental issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did this integration work or what happened or did the
                        Private Enterprise Bureau fade away in the process? What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It lasted for about two years until the elections and then with that
                    coming in it just began to fade away. The remnants of the Private Enterprise
                    Bureau got moved to the Global Bureau and still exists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What should be USAID's role in the private sector, private
                        investment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It should focus on creating an environment in terms of looking at the
                    rules and regulations, at the road blocks that inhibit indigenous private sector
                    efforts. The Reagan/Bush people, who wandered around the Andes, got very
                    frustrated with USAID; it was sort of like turning an ocean tanker's direction;
                    it was willing to change and did change in looking at indigenous enterprise and
                    what rules and regulations needed to be changed with that. These guys would go
                    jumping up and down the hallways, what about America enterprise? How about
                    sending a trade mission? How about funding some commodity purchases so we could
                    buy tractors and help out John Deere? They saw private sector as being an
                    American investment overseas and I don't think professionally that USAID ever
                    saw it that way. USAID was more or less under duress and heavy pressure so that
                    it got incorporated into some programs. But, I think for the most part, USAID
                    saw American investment overseas as being something that was the legitimate
                    province of the Commerce Department, the Export-Import Bank, the OPIC (Overseas
                    Private Investment Corporation), a variety of other places with the investment
                    instruments and a mandate for that. USAID was neither an appropriate institution
                    nor did it have any real skilled people who were interested in doing that. I had
                    a couple of people get grafted on to the Agency who had skills and talent in
                    that area, and they'd get very frustrated because they couldn't penetrate the
                    USAID bureaucracy They couldn't get people to do anything</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I recall, they wanted to make direct investments. They
                        wanted to promote a particular enterprise and make an investment in this
                        particular enterprise or that enterprise.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes. They would find it, for some reason the tourist industry seemed to
                    be very active, but they'd found somebody in the tourist industry who wanted to
                    make a direct investment to put a hotel in a country and the hotel company would
                    buy the land, which in affect meant that the host government would contribute
                    the land. Then, they would put up the hotel, but they wanted USAID to pay it for
                    the roads that would be required to get from the airport to the hotel; for USAID
                    to pay for the training programs; for people who could run the hotel; and/or
                    become a minority owner of the hotel. And, they saw no conflict of interest.
                    They saw no government ethical problem and essentially being the front man for
                    particular institutions.</p>
                <p>AA for the Asia Bureau, who I think very highly of, was extremely talented and
                    ran a very good program, but I remember one meeting in which she was saying that
                    a USAID Mission Director should be willing to go into the host government and
                    promote a particular private sector American investor. My reaction was that I
                    couldn't think of a Mission Director worth a ... who would do that. It was just
                    a totally inappropriate role. She and I probably talked 30 minutes going over
                    that. She saw it as something that is very common in the private sector where
                    she had worked. That if somebody worked for you, performed a good job, that you
                    very much would go in and recommend him to somebody else and say, this man's a
                    good man, he can perform the job. But, it did depend upon getting a kickback
                    from that guy, you know, it was just wrong. I said that for me, for a USAID
                    institution, for a USAID Mission Director to go into some government official's
                    office and vouch for a private enterprise, you know, implied that U.S.
                    governments stood in back of that guy. It was a U.S. government guarantee,
                    because the USAID Director was the U.S. government employee. Otherwise, the
                    government wouldn't listen to him. It would be an interesting recommendation,
                    other than the fact that it sounded like the U.S. government was promoting it
                    and would stand in back of it, and if it, say, should fold, we would make it
                    right. The Mission Directors couldn't make it right. There was a limit as to
                    what they could do and so they shouldn't go in and promote individual projects.
                    And, she didn't understand my viewpoint. I mean, she honestly could not see why
                    that would be a problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Interesting. What were the other initiatives in the
                        Asia Bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The environmental initiative.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: The AA wanted to have a Presidential Initiative and so she wanted DP to
                    think of some potential initiatives. So, I came up with environmental initiative
                    as being something that meshed with President Bush and his policy statements on
                    environment, that it is something that you could probably get the President
                    attached to it as a hook, because Bush had served in the South Pacific in World
                    War II. The whole story of World War II was still surrounded with all these
                    names like Solomon Islands and Tarawa and all the rest. There was something that
                    also fit with the fact that the U.S. actually did produce some of the better
                    environmental equipment that was on the market internationally and so in good
                    conscious we could promote other governments into buying that equipment for
                    cleaning the air or water or what have you. So, it was seen as promoting
                    American exports, as well as working on environmental policy issues with people
                    and governments in the Asia area. Also, bringing in PVOs. That was one of the
                    things that I wanted to make sure happened. That when we defined the private
                    sector, initially the private sector people defined it as helping U.S. exporters
                    and so I worked to make that again to include both the PVO groups who might
                    participate, as well as an indigenous private sector entrepreneurs, rather than
                    just the single focus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I don't really know subsequently what happened to it. I worked on it a
                    very short time, in the Asia Bureau, a very short time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did she have a sense that the Asian Bureau was trying to
                        find a role for itself on a new initiative and that it had out lived its
                        earlier development role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: You got some of that among the career Asia people. And, offhand I don't
                    think the AA had that as a motive. She was a political appointee. She saw it
                    more as an evolution of the program to where you had more contacts with the
                    advanced and open countries, fewer contracts and with the totally undeveloped.
                    But, I don't think that she saw the initiative. She did not see the
                    environmental initiative as a way to try out a new ground, as much as she saw it
                    as a new type of mechanism that could be used in relationships back and forth. I
                    think the career Asian people really did wonder what was happening in terms of
                    their life long interest and involvement in various Asian countries. And, as
                    those Asian countries grow and develop, what should be a USAID relationship or
                    would there be a USAID relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Does that take care of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. You said your next assignment was to work on the
                        Task Force for the development program for Russia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Right. The United Soviet States of Russia had collapsed, the USSR. Out
                    of that, no one was quite sure what would develop. The State Department saw some
                    type of federal relationship and they tried at first very hard to shape and
                    direct the USAID program into supporting some of the regional initiatives. Most
                    other analysts in the academic community, as well as fairly high level analysts
                    coming out of NATO and the U.S. Defense Department, saw absolutely no hope for
                    the federation existing and saw no reason why it would be to the U.S. benefit if
                    such a relation did exist and very much promoted working with the 11, 12
                    different countries that were becoming independent states. The initial USAID
                    work on this was given to Richard Bissell. (I forget at that point whether he
                    was head of Science and Technology Bureau or head of PPC. It had been rearranged
                    so often.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: S and T.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: But, he asked Barbara Turner who had been with the Agency and had left
                    to go work with a foundation and was coming back to the Agency to head up the
                    Task Force. So, Barbara started building a Task Force that initially was like
                    seven people, then it was 17 people, and then it was 27 people, and then it was
                    70 people, and it just sort of grew like topsy. As an evolution despite the fact
                    that I stood there and stamped my feet and waved my hands and told people that
                    based upon what I'd seen in the Sahel and East Africa, that you could not run a
                    program with seven people, that it would grow to be larger, that you should
                    start from the beginning on planning for a larger team, but you should start
                    from the basic fundamentals of having enough office space, enough computers,
                    yellow legal pads. You know, I mean you shouldn't start with seven, then eight,
                    then nine, then ten, and eleven. If you just inched your way along you will
                    always be behind the eight ball. You'll never be properly office housed, because
                    you told someone that you only needed eight offices and the next thing you tell
                    them you need 28, then you tell them you need 80. So, as a result they finally
                    came up with the 80 offices, but they were scattered on five different floors
                    and different wings of the State Department. Internal communications on the Task
                    Force were made more difficult, rather than eased, in sort of arrangement.</p>
                <p>What is the saying: “people who don't learn from history are doomed to the
                    repeated it.” Well, that's the same thing here. The State Department couldn't
                    understand why we needed a large staff force, that we could do it with a small
                    group of people. In this case the people who are working within State had never
                    served in LDCs. They considered themselves the cream of the State Department,
                    because they worked on Russia and Eastern European countries; they were the best
                    of the best. They didn't see anything that was coming around the corner that
                    they couldn't handle, much better than those people already in USAID who were
                    use to working in those little poor third world countries. You know, we not
                    working with nuclear powers.</p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>I made the argument and tried to work on them over time. What USAID did was to
                    manage the introduction of change. How much change can you push for; how much is
                    a reasonable degree of change you can ask somebody to make in X number of years;
                    what's the rate of change; how do try to be sensitive to unanticipated affects,
                    even if it was a good idea to begin with, you know, so the consequences aren't
                    working out too hot. And, if the State Department would think of us that way
                    they would understand why it would be really effective for the people and
                    country, because you really only get that kind of country, host government
                    knowledge about competence of personnel and that dynamic that says, yeah, but a
                    country is simply not making adequate progress on...; it's a shell game. Or, yes
                    the country is really trying to implement the program but they're handicapped,
                    because Joe Blow was killed in a car wreck and you know, just all of those
                    things that go into knowing truly what happened in the host government.</p>
                <p>But, I have to admit it was fun. It was just incredible to watch the Soviet Union
                    dissolve and the independent states take their place in trying to figure out how
                    much we knew about those states, and what was going on in them, and who would be
                    the American experts that we could tap into, and what kind of programs made
                    sense. As usual again, it was the same and it wasn't because I was associated
                    with it. They followed the same pattern as the Sahel and in East Africa. They
                    started out with the emergency assistance program where we sent in disaster
                    teams that would go with particular air cargo loads of assistance to get some
                    assurance that it got to the people, rather than being diverted to the military
                    base and being used for the military. I worked with terms of reference for the
                    first emergency team that went out and I had a whole section on things that they
                    could find out for us that would be useful for later that it would not take a
                    lot of time. It was clear their major purpose in staff time was to the emergency
                    shipment in trying to make sure that those got to somebody that needed them.</p>
                <p>But, in the meantime, if you walk around town and just talk to a few people; you
                    could find out how many people in that area use a bank. What kind of banking
                    arrangements are there. The State Department said they still don't have banks,
                    you don't understand, they never had banks. My reaction was, there probably
                    isn't a branch of the Soviet banking system, but I am 99.1 percent sure too that
                    they have got local traders in that area who send money to their relatives who
                    go somewhere else and that money transfer is represented by a piece of paper and
                    it's not represented by people walking, you know, money cash metal across the
                    border.</p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>I thought the basic lesson from all the emergency stuff that I had worked with in
                    Africa was that there are ways to do emergency aid so that you begin to lay a
                    foundation and can lead to other kinds of activities and that your emergency
                    assistance doesn't have to be disruptive in a sense of interfering and
                    destroying the local agricultural markets. You can handle it so that it is
                    supportive of longer term solutions. And, the first teams that went in, which
                    were these disaster assistance teams, they were going all over the place, could
                    come back with some information on how the local economies worked, not at the
                    official level, because you could go to a piece of paper from the Embassy and
                    read about the official level. But, at the unofficial level, I was just talking
                    to people, well how to you get something to so and so who lives in so and so;
                    how do you send mail; is there a telephone locally; how many people in this town
                    have a telephone. You know, only two people have a telephone, but ten people had
                    cellular telephones.</p>
                <p>It is long range information and the State Department said it would look too much
                    like spying that if we had all this emergency team going in and asking these
                    kind of questions, that it would be disruptive and that the USAID people on
                    these teams should limit themselves to making sure you knew where the food went.
                    USAID decided that it was premature to start asking those questions, because the
                    decision had not yet been made about putting in a USAID staff in those
                    countries. So, despite my best efforts, we wound up starting a day late and a
                    dollar short trying to catch up with their people, so this is why I am a little
                    skeptical about experience, lessons learned. No one ever really wants to learn a
                    lesson except the person who learned it to begin with.</p>
                <p>But, we finally did reach an agreement. James Baker, who was Secretary of State,
                    did what was in effect was supposed to be a courtesy call on each of the
                    governments that were becoming independent. Up until then, the State Department
                    had been holding a line that they were going to have a Regional Embassy in
                    Moscow handle all of these countries. Baker came back and he gave the staff the
                    instructions, there will be an American Embassy there, you will raise the
                    American flag. And so, the State Department went into a scramble of its own as
                    to how to put in 13 Embassies, the Embassy Staff and logistics and the
                    delegation of authorities and who reports to whom. The Moscow Embassy was just
                    furious, because this whole area that had been under their umbrella was suddenly
                    going to be 13 Ambassadors who reported directly to Baker and the Ambassador
                    Strauss in Moscow. But, actually Strauss did an extraordinary good job.
                    Everything that he worked on personally turned out well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Strauss, who was Ambassador to Russia, who has a leading the role in the
                    Democratic Party; he was appointed as Ambassador to the Philippines; he came
                    back and he is now in a law firm here in Washington. He was superb. Everything I
                    ever heard about him, all the meetings that he chaired and what happened in
                    terms of the State Department growth, and the USAID growth, you know, from my
                    point of view were sensible; very common sense. You know, let's do it, we'll
                    worry about some of those other things you're concerned about later. But, his
                    staff was really trying to hold on to power in a sense that they had previously
                    been responsible for the entire USSR and 60s percent of it was being taken away.
                    There was a real question as to whether Russia, which is a federation of States
                    itself, whether that would hold together and that one still periodically
                    surfaces as to whether that will hold together or not. But, once a decision was
                    made, then we would have Embassies in the individual countries and then the
                    decision was made that we would have a USAID Office. Initially, because of our
                    own staffing problems and logistical problems of moving people around, we would
                    have a Regional Officer in Armenia who would handle the Caucus area, and a
                    Regional Office in Kazakhstan to handle Kyrgyzstan, Uzbekistan, Tajikistan,
                    Turkmenistan. Then, we had a Regional Office in Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a huge responsibility?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Enormous responsibilities and we sent them out with a wing and a
                    prayer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What could they do, or what did they do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: First of all, I managed to get some very senior experienced USAID people
                    interested. Unlike earlier programs that I worked with where you recruited
                    someone who was fairly new but very promising and essentially you talked them
                    into taking a chance, because they were young enough in their careers to try
                    this. We managed to recruit very senior personnel from USAID who just found the
                    whole context fascinating. We had Craig Buck go to the STAN countries, Pakistan,
                    Tajikistan, Kyrgyzstan. I can't remember now who the other ones were. The
                    Mission Director in the Philippines, I cannot think of his name, was being
                    transferred from Indonesia to the Philippines and we caught him while he was in
                    mid-flight and talked him in to going to Russia and then we spent the next year
                    and a half trying to get his household affects to him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was Jim Norris?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, Jim Norris. His household affects had already been shipped from
                    Indonesia to the Philippines and we were trying to get them to ship them onward
                    to Russia and the Philippines couldn't ship, because they didn't have any codes.
                    But the way bureaucracies work, they function when you have the sign language or
                    sign codes that says, go to A, go to B, go directly to jail and don't pass go.
                    Wherever your rule was you need to have it written down somewhere so people can
                    find it. In this office, we didn't. There was simply no time, things were moving
                    too fast and USAID felt that they had to follow the State Department's guidance
                    and the State Department was geared to a much quicker turnaround time, that if
                    you decide this today and you change your mind on Thursday, then you can make
                    that decision. And, we had in the USAID a pipeline of how you move people, how
                    you get things going is much longer than that. So, you have to tell me now so I
                    can have three people next September. So, I've got six months time to recruit
                    them, to get them there, to get their household effects there, to lease the
                    house, to lease the office, and all the rest of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do these people do when they first arrive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Jack of all trades. They started with the emergency and the emergency
                    follow up. You know, getting assistance sent to the right places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Such as?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Whether it was food, whether it was non-fat dry milk, whether it was
                    cheese, Red Cross bandages, sterile hypodermics, what have you, that we pulled
                    heavily off of USAID's OFDA (Office of Foreign Disaster Relief) funds until the
                    Congress gave us special funds for Russia and then we started pulling off of the
                    Russia fund. So, part of that time we were really handicapped in how much we
                    could do, because you didn't know what was coming down the pipe. Luckily,
                    Barbara Turner had the sense to when the initial discussions on the Hill were
                    going on, to slip in that all the funds, the pragmatic funds, for administrative
                    expenses, so we didn't have to worry about USAID having enough operating money
                    to support us; we could use the program money for it. I think that really saved
                    us in the long run.</p>
                <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                <p>You also had really talented people like Jim Norris who's a professional senior
                    guy fully, practiced by the background in dealing with host government officials
                    and embassies and explaining economics and explaining relationships for aid
                    agreements, and for World Bank agreements and what USAID can and can't do. At
                    the same time, there was no support staff. They had no GSOs; they had no Exec
                    Officers; they had no Contract Officers. Basically, they were carrying the
                    entire load themselves where as much assistance as we could get by pulling the
                    people in TDY and sending people out on TDY for support. But, if you don't have
                    the staff, then you don't do the paperwork; you know, it just doesn't get done.
                    If you don't have the staff, you still have to lease the building and if you
                    don't have the Exec Officer to handle some things than whoever's the ranking
                    USAID officer does it. The work of wiring offices, ordering telephones and
                    getting telephones installed, making sure that stuff isn't stuck in customs, you
                    know, that doesn't go away, somebody's got to do it. If you don't have an Exec
                    Officer or a junior officer to do it, then your senior officer goes and does it.
                    That's the way it was in Moscow. So, a large part of what the first guys did was
                    essentially housekeeping of setting up the support base. They could handle other
                    kinds of activities and people. Pretty much the areas in which we would be
                    involved grew out of a series of seminars (not really the right word), but
                    basically what Barbara organized. Back in the first days when the Task Force was
                    just being set up, they had a series of seminars, three-day workshops, where
                    representatives would be invited from Russia and various parts of Russia. You
                    would have donors who are already active in Russia and you'd have U.S. experts
                    in those areas and they would organize technical lines so you'd have an energy
                    working group, you had an environment working group, you had a nuclear working
                    group, you had health working groups. And, pretty much the areas in which we did
                    things were set up and flowed out of the original selection of different working
                    groups, and that was pretty much done by the donors, the U.S., World Bank,
                    Germany. They had e-mail and phone conversations at fairly senior levels and
                    sort of carved out these big chunks of areas.</p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>Some of them directly related to things that we were interested in like how
                    nuclear energy was processed and handled, and the security of nuclear energy,
                    where military war heads were a major national security issue for U.S. So, we
                    had one group of people who just worried about that, and worried about Chernobyl
                    and how the Chernobyl Nuclear Factory had been designed and the fact that the
                    Nuclear Facility in Romania had exactly the same design as Chernobyl and could
                    easily blow up like Chernobyl did. That led to the donors and the U.S. talking
                    to the government of Romania and trying to get the government of Romania to
                    close down the nuclear facility. And, the Romanians responded very sensibly that
                    they lived in a very cold country where cold was a factor two months out of the
                    year and that the Nuclear Power Plant was their most reliable source of warmth.
                    That made it more difficult, because the Uzbekistan border had been closed and
                    the Romanians and the Uzbekistanis were actually fighting at that point, and
                    they'd put an absolute blanket embargo on any fuel oil being shipped in to
                    Romania. The only other way that fuel oil could get into Romania was through
                    Turkey and Turkey was a continual historical opponent, so the Romanians were a
                    landlocked country with no access to any other source of fuel, so they wanted to
                    keep the nuclear power Plant running or they wanted the donors to guarantee that
                    their fuel could come in. You had very special particular interests like that
                    scattered all over the area.</p>
                <p>The interesting thing from my view point was that (for at that point the 25 years
                    I'd been with USAID), the push had been on doing better planning, of more
                    effective planning, more successful planning, of being able to have plans so
                    then you could see what your progress was, you could go back and evaluate. At
                    one point I understand, we'd insisted that the governments have a national plan
                    before the donors would help them. In the case of the Soviet Union, the USAID
                    organization had moved from a Task Force through several subsequent stages to
                    where eventually we became a Bureau, independent and all to ourselves.</p>
                <p>When the Bureau was set up I was going to be the Office Director for the
                    Development Planning Office and the State Department had an absolute tizzy that
                    we couldn't call it a Planning Office, because that had too many overtones of
                    Russian state planning. What we wanted to do was convince the Russians to do
                    entrepreneur, pre-market capitalism, so they didn't want an office called
                    planning. They didn't want an office called development, because that implied
                    that we were being materialistic: Russia was a country equal to our own and that
                    we could do development in all the other countries, but this was a major
                    European ally and we couldn't do development there. So, we came up with Office
                    of Policy and Program Coordination, so that we didn't have any other buzz words
                    that State disliked.</p>
                <p>But, at that point, no one wanted to do any planning. The State Department was
                    absolute adamant that we had to do entrepreneurs and capitalism. Almost all the
                    people in USAID wanted some kind of a sector plan, an economic plan, you got to
                    have some kind of strategy that's based on what's the host government's plans
                    are. And, the answer was no. We will do things on target of opportunity basis.
                    In my opinion, the State Department took far too great a control of the budget.
                    It is a tribute to every bit of diplomacy that Malcolm Butler (head of the
                    program in Washington) had or that Barbara Turner had that you had any kind of
                    decent program at all, because they spent 90 percent of their time fighting
                    fires on bright ideas that some junior officer in State had had about what would
                    be good to do. Frankly, there was nothing particularly wrong with their ideas.
                    There's was one guy wandering around who wanted money from USAID to set up a
                    modern supermarket grocery store, which could show the Russians how you could go
                    into one store and buy your fruits, your vegetables, your meats, your sundries
                    and then go to the checkout and checkout with everything, as opposed to the
                    Russian current scheme of you go to a store that only handled bread. Then, you
                    go up to the window and you get a voucher for bread; then you go over and you
                    show your voucher for bread to the attendant who gives you a loaf of bread, then
                    you take your loaf of bread back and stand in line to pay for your loaf of
                    bread. And, that we should do this grand supermarket scheme. My reactions was,
                    that's nice. If he's got money and he wants to do it, fine, but it's not
                    something that USAID should do. There are European countries this day which
                    don't have multi-department grocery stores. The French get along just fine,
                    buying bread in one store and cheese in another store. You know, let the Soviets
                    do it however they want to, it's not something that had a high priority for
                    something we could do. The State Department was furious, because they thought
                    that it had to be high priority, it was highly visible, you know you see what
                    blah, blah, blah. In all due respect that's actually what they're after, they
                    saw it as targets of opportunity and so we could have impact within six months
                    and they could have a program. I just got more and more tired of dealing with
                    them and I had nothing but admiration for the fact that Barbara Turner managed
                    to keep the program 90s percent the same. But, it is interesting as a lot of
                    these programs for USAID are ones in which people were encouraged to do targets
                    of opportunity. That if you found an institution that you could work with that
                    had a continuing connection with American Universities that had somehow been
                    maintained through the Cold War, find it. Just anything that looked like they
                    could have a continuing link with an American institution, or a PVO or ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they (PVOs) there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yeah, they were there. Incredibly enough they were there. Land O'Lakes
                    Dairy Cooperatives had been there for years, working very low key and hiding
                    under a bush, but they were there. What essentially we did was we funneled
                    money. Any American institution that had some kind of contact or link with
                    someone in the former Soviet Union that could be related to the original working
                    groups that were set up by the donors that started the whole process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, you did have a framework for the different programs
                        from the seminars. That was a degree of planning.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Right, you had that kind of framework and those groups from the very
                    beginning in cooperation with people who had made life histories of knowing
                    about or learning about the Soviet area. They weren't neophytes in any sense.
                    They knew the Soviet Union; they knew the system; they could speak Russian;
                    others had been there many times. But, there was no attempt to use those groups
                    as planning groups in any structured sense of having, you know, here are goals;
                    here's our baseline data; you can see how far we've moved. They worked; they got
                    together; they came up with things that were pretty sensible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And go to the person in the field with these categories
                        and look for opportunities within those categories.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Pretty much. We probably gave out our briefing books to everybody we
                    sent out, and so the massive quantities of what had happened in the working
                    groups, various policy statements by Secretary of State Baker, as to what the
                    policies were, everything like that, and told people to draw an oath that that
                    was as much guidance as we could give them. That operationally was the guidance;
                    we will try and build a staff under you, but recognize at first you will be out
                    there by yourself. So, for at least the first generation of projects, you know,
                    go with things that are already in place. If there's an American PVO that for
                    years has had some type of relationship with the local Community of Christ
                    Church Outreach Day Camp Center, go for it. Fund the Day Camp Center. Build into
                    your curriculum how great capitalism is. But, basically the chance to spread the
                    money to have visible impact in as broad a section as possible and that our
                    operational method of doing that was to lean on pre-existing links with someone
                    in the American system. Be it PVO; be it academic...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't that lead to these mega projects with the U.S.
                        institutions?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: It left a lot of proposals like that. It probably would have happened,
                    except that was a side growth to what initially was pure technical assistance to
                    what a strong IMF program and the World Bank supported doing. Putting Supporting
                    Assistance funds (ESF) into the Ukraine. It was our own dumbness, I guess is how
                    you put it, that we mentally envisioned the Ukraine and Romania and Kazakhstan
                    stretched out on one belt. And, they were all very different countries. Like
                    Ukraine, had one of the first banks; it's the largest country in Europe. It is
                    much larger than Germany or France. The program in Ukraine we started was a very
                    small technical assistance program primarily worried about Chernobyl, you know,
                    quickly became to the point where we were a major actor in the internal reforms
                    in providing Supporting Assistance (ESF) in conjunction with the IMF. So, the
                    big chunks of money started going for the economic reform policies and programs
                    as opposed to—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Import kind of things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yeah. And, some just budget support, rather than the technical
                    assistance taking off on the big multi-mega umpteen billion university
                    initiatives and on like that. What was also a problem was on the Hill in the
                    House or the Senate. In order to get a bill passed for support to Russia, we had
                    every living President write and support it and every past Secretary of State
                    write and support it. But, then the Congressmen and Senators would give their
                    vote only if their pet initiative got included in the bill. So, there were
                    hundreds of earmarks in the bill for assistance. In the conference meeting
                    between the House and the Senate, most of those got dropped, but they were kept,
                    quote as “soft earmarks”, which our legislative office, and more importantly the
                    State's legislative office, felt that we had to honor, because otherwise you
                    wouldn't get the guys vote the next time around. You had really small scale
                    projects written into a soft earmark.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: That we should provide assistance to the airplane links between Russia
                    and the Far East of the Soviet Union; that we should promote better trade back
                    and forth, and that should be done through airlines that had existing passenger
                    service prior to June 10 of 1985 what. It took one year to set that up. It was
                    under Ted Stevenson from Alaska who for years wanted us to build the airports
                    and runways in Alaska and in Vladivostok or whatever it was. We had one earmark
                    that encouraged us to experiment with long distance education using television
                    as a means of reaching across under-populated areas, based on the model of
                    telecommunications used by school district 22 in Portland, Oregon. It was little
                    things like that up to big things like to get ladies support we wound up with 20
                    million dollars earmarked for Vermont dairy products.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To buy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: We used money to buy the dairy products and then ship the dairy products
                    out and distribute them to various people, various groups. I mean, everybody
                    wanted a piece of that action and everybody on the Hill had a different idea:
                    did you trust the Russians? Did you use this as an opportunity to further
                    embarrass and humiliate old leaders, did you use this as an opportunity to train
                    the youth of Russia? There were specific instructions that we bring, I think it
                    was 500 teenagers in on youth education in our high schools. You know,
                    Cooperative Extension Program that we had had for years, I think. But, it was
                    extremely difficult, because that program had so many ties that were pulling in
                    different directions and the basic coordination was being done by State, which
                    was, I don't know whether it was better or worse than USAID would have done, but
                    it was different. It was another complicating layer that we had to deal with in
                    terms of making any decisions about the budget, about the staff, anything. At
                    that point when I was ready to pull my hair out, Clinton won the election and
                    set up transition teams to work with each of the cabinet little agencies and
                    Golar Butcher (former AA for Africa) was picked as the transition leader for
                    USAID.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we go into the transition period, how do you size
                        up your experience with the NIS countries and how long were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I was there for about a year and a half and then broke into the
                    transition team work and then came back for about a half a year before I
                    retired. I was Director of the Office of Program and Policy Coordination and
                    then I went to the transition position. When I came back I was a Senior Advisor.
                    I think they concocted some sort of title of Senior Policy Advisor, but it was
                    being a special assistant to Barbara Turner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was the Deputy then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: At that point she was the Senior Deputy Administrator working with
                    Malcolm Butler. The AA and then later when Malcolm left and Tom Dyan came in.
                    What Barbara wanted was somebody who worked with her, but who was senior enough
                    to where when she had conflicting meetings she could delegate me to go to one of
                    the meetings and speak for her as a substitute DAA. It was a great job. You
                    couldn't have asked for a better job, but by the time that came along I was so
                    burned out that I just wanted to retire. I was very cynical about the entire
                    process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0178" n="Page0178"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: The NIS process: I think it was so micro-managed by the State Department
                    and it looked like the future of the Agency just evolved more and more, no
                    consultation or coordination or State Department setting foreign policy
                    objectives or anything in that role, but it was more that they micro-managed the
                    day-to-day operational level and had no feel that development was a professional
                    technique that you learned. That it was something that anybody could do. It was
                    mainly a process of processing money. They saw USAID as being useful to keep
                    around, because USAID had certain operational talents that they didn't have in
                    terms of being able to handle money transfers and commodity transfers. But no
                    respect for USAID professionally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know there was no effort at the higher levels to try to
                        separate these functions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Interestingly enough, Malcolm Butler did some of it, probably more
                    effectively than anybody else did. When the program first started, and he was
                    the senior coordinator in charge of it and then later as it kept growing the
                    internal fight was whether or not it joined the Eastern European Bureau or
                    became a Bureau of its own. The decision was made that it would be a Bureau of
                    its own under Malcolm Butler and that Butler wound up working, I would, say 95
                    percent of his time trying to keep State under control.</p>
                <p>USAID would periodically show up in a form of one of the senior PPC people or
                    somebody in the Administrator's Office. They would shake their heads at what we
                    were doing or what we were not doing and it would go away again. Malcolm had no
                    backup or support for cover from the Administrator, from General Counsel, from
                    PPC, from any of them. They were perfectly prepared to tell Malcolm what they
                    thought Malcolm should do, but they were not prepared to go meet with State and
                    tell State, yeah, nay, this is it, this isn't it. So, Malcolm had to make the
                    best deals that he could to keep the program going.</p>
                <p>The main problem with that in what I saw much more in the Eastern European effort
                    than in the INS effort is, that the whole staff in the Eastern European effort
                    knew that essentially whatever State wanted State would get. And, if they had a
                    fight with State and they tried to buck it up the channels on USAID's side that
                    no one in USAID would support them. So, everybody started cutting the best deal
                    they could. You wound up with it being done at the Assistant Desk Officer level
                    and the junior control level, because they'd just cut the best deal that they
                    could get, because they didn't see any help in getting a better deal or pushing
                    it further up the ladder. In the INS, I think people did see grounds for hope,
                    that Barbara and Malcolm would go to bat for them and had more success than
                    failure in terms of saying like, this is the way USAID works and this is why
                    USAID works this way and we're going to keep working this way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the primary factors guiding State, what they
                        were pushing for or what they wanted that we disagreed with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: From the original staff of these working groups, the State Department
                    had designated State people who were supposed to follow up on each working
                    group. So, they had an education expert who was a Junior State Department
                    Officer who had worked, I think in Canada before; they had a housing officer;
                    they had somebody comparable to each of these staffs, but they were very Junior
                    State Department Foreign Service Officers. Because, internally inside of State,
                    instead of it being run by the Bureau for European Operations, which would be
                    more equivalent to our Bureau structure, the State Department set up a separate
                    Task Force that would handle all of the key issues of Eastern European and INS
                    to where, I think, at one point on USAID budget decisions, we had five different
                    points in State to clear with, which involved their Task Force, their Regional
                    Bureau, who otherwise wasn't involved with the program, their legislative office
                    who never told our legislative office what they were doing. To the point, I kid
                    you not, at one point the State Legislative Office had set up a Senate briefing
                    where they wanted to brief the Senate on the budget breakdown of what the U.S.
                    Executive Branch would be asking for. They set it up, had it all ready to go,
                    the Senate staffers called USAID and said, State is coming up here this
                    afternoon, don't you think you ought to come too? So, Marianne Sullivan (USAID
                    Legislative Affairs) grabbed me and we went up and we got the briefing on what
                    our budget was going to be like from State as they gave it to the Hill. It was
                    the most round about coordination, communication that I've ever heard of and
                    then they went ballistic over no changes were allowed in the budget that this is
                    what they said in the budget and this is what they're going to do.</p>
                <p>USAID finagles budgets all the time, you know, you go up, you go down, your
                    percentages shift. So, half our time was spent trying to fit what we were going
                    to do anyway into one of their statements as to what they said they were going
                    to do. Housing was a big issue with them, because the Soviet Union was pulling
                    back all of their military from Eastern Europe and there were no military
                    barracks to put the military people in. There was a fairly great fear on the
                    Soviet's side that if they didn't have something, preferably they'd like some
                    employment for these people, but in the meantime until they could get the
                    employment generation going they needed housing for them, definitely. So, we
                    entered in to an emergency housing program. It was rational, but it was very
                    much a commodity drop. It didn't lead to any other reforms in the housing
                    system, changes in their rules and regulations which related to why it takes 20
                    years to build your house. It didn't do anything about the underline problems;
                    it was just a band aid, a patch. And, in that particular case, State loved us,
                    because the Housing Office got the funds and they moved fast. They were happy
                    with it and their response and actions were such that State was very happy with
                    it. On the side lines, you know, I was sitting there gripping it up, it's a band
                    aid, it's a patch, it didn't do anything about the underline problems. And, the
                    State Department didn't care. It's not that they didn't believe me, it is they
                    didn't care about the underline problems; the problems that would come up in ten
                    years or 20 years.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just a quick short term effort?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Very quick, very short term, keep the lid on it, make sure it doesn't
                    fall apart</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very superficial, in some sense, you know, a quick
                        response is sometimes needed, but you have to do more than that. Well, okay.
                        You can add more on this is you want with it. But, you helped out with the
                        transition and what was that job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: To back up a couple of years when I was wandering around foot loose and
                    fancy free, I was working with PPC on trying to translate the In-country Study
                    Report into a meaningful internal guidance and not getting very far with it,
                    because everybody wanted to make a footnote for why they should be different
                    under certain circumstances. Mark Edelman was the Deputy Administrator who had
                    previously been my boss in the Africa Bureau. So, Mark decided that there's
                    been, well the Agency had just gone through a major reorganization sponsored by
                    Roskins. A consulting team came in and they came up with different
                    organizational boxes that they moved around all over the place. Mark wanted to
                    do another reorganization study, but not in a sense of moving organizational
                    boxes around. He wanted to look at what would be the change in policy given that
                    the Cold War had come to an end and assuming that USAID would continue to have a
                    role in post-Cold War world, what would that role be. So, he formed something
                    called the “No Name Study Group—the “No Name Task Force.” Because he didn't want
                    a lot of rumors going around the Bureaus and the agency that we were going to
                    have another reorganization or getting people upset, because there had already
                    been so much action. And, it was Mark Edelman, who was Deputy Administrator, Ray
                    Love who was Counselor, Senior Foreign Service Officer, the man at that time who
                    was running General Counsel as acting DC, Larry Saiers from the Africa Bureau. I
                    think there were one or two people that I can't remember, with me being the
                    Secretariat, or the drafter, or the articulator, and coming up with drafts about
                    what I thought about the Agency, did the role of the Agency change because the
                    Cold War had stopped. If it had changed, was there something different we should
                    be doing that we weren't doing. That took about, I guess we worked on it for
                    about six months and it was called the “No Name Task Force.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you produce?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Produced a paper, as usual and presented it to Roskins and Roskins
                    thought it was excellent, very good. This was like six months, finished probably
                    in August or September before G.H.W. Bush and Roskins and then they were out the
                    door and the new Administration was coming in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the particular message from this paper?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: To recreate the argument: there's a fairly active body of opinion
                    intellectually, academically, and throughout the government, that with the Cold
                    War ending and East/West issues no longer predominately shaping policy and
                    programs, you would move to North/South issues and that would become, the agenda
                    for the next decade. I argued that that was wrong and managed to sustain that
                    through the Task Force and on to Roskins.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were they wrong?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Merely because the countries, the developing world, had during the Cold
                    War taken on client status with one or other of the super powers. As a side line
                    there was a lot of discussion that what the real North/South issues were between
                    the developed countries and the undeveloped countries and the major focus
                    attention should be the U.N. The U.N, working through a Myers-Briggs Personality
                    type of test: developed, undeveloped, less developed, relatively developed,
                    whatever way to characterize it . I argued that it wasn't going to happen.</p>
                <p>Primarily it wasn't going to happen because the third world south countries
                    really did not have a community of interest and a common agenda that they wanted
                    to pursue their interests in an international forum like the U.N. or the IBRD.
                    They liked being able to hit up individual donors; they had different agendas
                    one from each other. If you will, the operating tactics that they had used
                    during the Cold War of trying to play one side off another side would probably
                    go away since they now had one superpower to deal with. But, they still
                    maintained that in terms of their negotiating positions they would find
                    different actors within that system to try and play off. And the North/South
                    agenda simply would never be adopted as a common agenda, either by the host
                    undeveloped countries or by the developed countries and that we were probably in
                    for a period of more commercial mercantilism, you know, rivalry, than we had
                    previously been in. So, that there would be more discord rather than more
                    commonality and that from USAID's point of view, the need for donor coordination
                    would be greater than ever. Our ability to do coordination would really depend
                    much more on the White House and the State Department than on what USAID could
                    do. They were going to have to set the lead and we could work at the fringes, if
                    you will. The World Bank Consultative Groups or the U.N. Round Table mechanism.
                    But, the overall donor coordination would have to be through State and the White
                    House. That was my major issue, so I guess that's the one I remember.</p>
                <p>The other issues that I dealt with were the health question and private sector
                    activity, had the Agency gone far enough or did they need to go farther. A large
                    part of the vocal ideas that were thrown around were again the tension between
                    USAID wanting to do local entrepreneur capitalism, versus doing promotion of
                    U.S. exports and capital investment. The paper came down primarily on the USAID
                    being an activist in creating the environment and promoting local
                    entrepreneurism while being a briefing agent for interested American private
                    sectors, that certainly we could brief them about local rules and regulations,
                    but providing much more of a facilitating role for American investment and a
                    direct supportive role for local entrepreneurs.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the paper include anything about the major areas of
                        program activity, like environment or democracy or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It talked a little bit about again it, but, I guess, it was pretty much
                    the Larry Saiers' argument. We need to move away from the functional categories
                    that Congress funds; that we needed to have a broader array of rules, if you
                    will, that we needed to take a much more aggressive role with Congress and fight
                    both the use of actual earmarks, as well as soft earmarks. Otherwise, we were
                    going to wind up being the Agency of parks and condoms as Larry described it.
                    And that the next immediate country was the window in which we could have an
                    influence on the Hill, and change it, etc. etc. etc. There was some attention
                    given to what would we do if the functional earmarks went away. How would we
                    program our funds, what would be different about what we'd do. I can't claim
                    that that was particularly insightful. It said, you know, give us more
                    flexibility in terms of looking at how fast projects could be implemented and
                    making professional judgments about priorities. But, I didn't get a strong feel
                    from anybody that there was a major, untapped, untouched problem, that if we had
                    functional flexibilities we would go do them. Part of that was because we did a
                    little bit of everything. We were scattered into so many sectors, ideas,
                    functions, that one of our major problems was that we needed to pare that down.
                    We needed to do fewer things and do them better. I can't recall anything that
                    came up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you prepared that and then we had a change of
                        Administration. Did anything happen with that paper?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Nope, not that I ever heard. We did do the presentation to Roskins and
                    he said all sorts of nice things about the good sounding paper, but it went on a
                    shelf. All of my papers that never went anywhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, election came and Clinton came into office, what
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0183" n="Page0183"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: The “No Name Task Force Study” was done and over with and then I went to
                    work on the NIS and did the Soviet Union bit for a year and a half. Then,
                    Clinton got elected and Golar Butcher, who had been my boss in the Africa
                    Bureau, under Ambassador Korry in the '70s was selected to head up the
                    transition team for USAID. She called me up and said, I believe it was Sandy
                    Burger who was the head of the overall international team had recruited Golar to
                    do the USAID part. Golar told him that her health was not up to doing it,
                    because she had had a couple of strokes and that she just didn't feel that her
                    health was strong enough to do it. Burger said, look pick any staff you want,
                    whatever resources you need we'll get them. So, Golar said she would do it. She
                    called me up and asked me if I was interested in working with her and I said,
                    “Yes, ma'am.” And, she got in touch with Gayleatha (Brown, ed?), who had been
                    her special assistant and who was currently working in the State Department as a
                    desk officer, I think. They had another black woman who was active in politics,
                    Bob Lester from USAID who was a lawyer, who's worked with every USAID
                    organizational scheme for the last 20 years, I think. And, the Chief of Staff,
                    also his name I have forgotten, were the transition team. The basic mandate of
                    the team was to task USAID to do vision papers for the new administration, which
                    would highlight things that would have to be decided the first six weeks, first
                    six months in office, others that could be delayed until later. But, essentially
                    USAID was tasked to do the basic briefing papers. Then, the overall Task Force
                    would read what USAID did and decide whether it was acceptable or ship it back
                    to USAID and saying, what about this, or what about this or that. The guy from
                    the Hill, I cannot remember his name, he was a Senior Foreign Policy
                    Staffer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dick McCall.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No, Dick McCall was working with the transition team, but he wasn't
                    working specifically with USAID. But, McCall was the one that most of the time
                    when we did briefings over at the big team, if you will, it was the only one at
                    State, USAID, USIA, all of the Foreign Affairs Agency, Dick McCall was our
                    contact person. Anyway, the guy from State did a basic draft of what he saw
                    where Clinton would take the USAID Agency in terms of changes or revisions or
                    major issues and then Lester and I reworked what he did, put it into an overall
                    paper and Golar would sign off on it and transmit it to Sandy Burger and then we
                    redid it. We had a short piece on stuff that USAID put together in terms of
                    ranking priorities and a transmittal note sending back to Sandy Burger and Dick
                    McCall. Golar worked with a woman from the private sector, who did personnel
                    decisions or personnel recommendations, recommending things that should be
                    done.</p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>That process went from November through December (1993) and then the transition
                    team broke up and everybody went back to their home office, except I went on
                    Christmas Eve vacation and when I came back it was a comedy of clowns type of
                    operation where it seemed like on January 20th, somebody on the Clinton team
                    realized that come Monday morning after Clinton was sworn in, he was going to
                    have all these agencies that had no representation from Clinton. And, come
                    Monday morning you're responsible, you're in charge. So, the major effort in the
                    two or three days before the inauguration, they brought in Clinton's supporters
                    who would serve as eyes and ears, or acting outposts, or acting administrators,
                    or somehow liaison representative of the White House to the different agencies.
                    At that point, Warren Christopher was already semi-designated to take over as
                    Secretary of State. Basically, he told the Clinton people that he would be the
                    Clinton representative who looked after foreign affairs that he didn't need any
                    of these political appointees. And so, USAID and USIA and Peace Core and OPIC,
                    no not OPIC, were basically listed as reporting to Warren Christopher and that
                    he would handle all policy issues until permanent heads of agencies were
                    established.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, because of the old Carter International Development Cooperation
                    Act (IDCA), USAID was under something called the Overseas Operations or
                    something that included the Commerce Department and OPIC was over in the
                    Commerce, OPIC and Export-Import Bank by the Commerce Department. USAID was
                    lumped together with all these agencies that were seen as domestic agencies with
                    an export promotion priority. So, come Monday morning, (name?) and (name ?)
                    Office said, we're here from the White House. And (name?) said, I beg your
                    pardon. So, absolutely nobody had told USAID that they were coming; nobody had
                    told State they were coming. State had already told them, don't show up at any
                    of the foreign affairs agencies, because Warren Christopher is in charge. And,
                    these guys, one had been the advance man for Clinton in Arizona and the other
                    was a California businessman who had been active in democratic politics since
                    the days of McGovern. He had gotten on a plane in California and taken the red
                    eye special overnight and gone directly from the airport to the White House and
                    had been given a briefing on his responsibilities as the Clinton Liaison Officer
                    and then went to (name?) office, who said who in the hell are you and where did
                    you come from and what are you talking about. So, evidently that first week was
                    just total confusion. With, of course, nobody really willing and able to say, go
                    away. He didn't know Christopher had told everybody to go away and State was
                    upset with us for having somebody. USAID had another transition team, Clark and
                    Phillips, who were the two guys sent over from the White House.</p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>Actually, I got a call in Texas while I was on Christmas vacation, telling me
                    that Jim Michael (USAID DA) and Sherper (USAID Councilor) wanted me to stay on
                    the transition team so there would be somebody from USAID working with Score(?)
                    and Phillips. Then, I got back to town and Score called me and said how much he
                    wanted me to stay on the transition team, meaning in-house and all, etc. etc.
                    etc. So, then I went to talk to Malcolm Butler and said, hey, the deal was I was
                    released from the NIS Task Force for six weeks, the original deal. And, this
                    time the deal would be that I would stay up on the transition until we got a
                    permanent Administrator, which nobody knew when that would be. It could be a
                    month, it could be six months, it could be a year.</p>
                <p>So, I went down and talked to Malcolm Butler about what was going on, etc. etc.
                    And, Malcolm's advice was that it was really something that I couldn't turn
                    down. They had both, Michael and Score had asked me to stick around, but I
                    really shouldn't stick around. It probably wasn't going to be any fun at all,
                    but his past experience that anything got tied up in reorganizational,
                    organizational staffing, new policies, etc. etc., that whoever did the briefing
                    became a defender of the status quo. That no matter how you tried to word
                    something, that when you explained how something worked, it always sounded like
                    you were defending it, even if the reality was that it was something that you
                    had originally opposed and didn't want to see done, but you lost and let the
                    program do it that way, and so you explain it to somebody else that this is how
                    we do it. Anyway, they probably would catch all of the flack from being a
                    defender of the status quo and he really couldn't release me from the Task Force
                    and not somehow replace me. They needed somebody; they were short, desperate,
                    etc. So, I finally worked out with Carlos and with Michael that I would go ahead
                    and stay with the transition team and that Carlos(?), my Deputy would be
                    promoted up as Acting Director and be the Director, even though on paper I was
                    still on the job, but he would be in the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the NIS?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: In NIS. So, I stayed with the Transition Task Force until August or
                    September of that year; they went through a whole series of people that might or
                    may not be interested in it, who might or may not fit certain criteria, you
                    know, that the White House personnel group had, and we started constantly doing
                    briefings for people sent over from the White House who were potential
                    candidates for Administrator or potential candidates for something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was your main function?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: That was our main direct function. The secondary function was briefing
                    Score. Score was absolutely tremendous.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0186" n="Page0186"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was this, Score?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Dick Score. He was nominated to be the White House eyes and ears. He had
                    no official delegation of authority. Jim Michael had all of that. But,
                    everything they did they checked with Score to see if that fit what the current
                    White House line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within USAID?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yeah. And, Score supposedly had the contacts with the White House to
                    where he could see if it passed the sniff test or if it needed to go to the
                    White House or further checking. Score's an engineer by training, was an
                    extraordinarily competent man who got very frustrated every time he got into the
                    internal workings of USAID, you know, absolutely bureaucratic and red tape, and
                    that how on earth do we ever get anything done when we had that many different
                    bases to touch. In later life, he wound up being the President's special envoy
                    to Bosnia to try and do an emergency rehab roads and water supplies program
                    there. He became very sympathetic to what it means to be operational. I
                    understand he did a fairly good job. He spent his first three months stomping
                    his feet and throwing temper tantrums, because the system wouldn't produce what
                    he felt it ought to be able to produce with a 24 hour turnaround.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any substantive function there in that role in
                        terms of new directions for the Agency or anything of that sort?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No. Only extremely peripheral. You know, talking people through why,
                    what does the Agency do now, what are their issues, especially for Score and for
                    some of the other political appointees as they gradually arrived. But, not
                    really developing the kind of creditability, I think that the new people would
                    turn to me for ideas on what do you do next. They very much saw me as a hold
                    over from the last regime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, there was no new thinking or no attempt to view the
                        world differently and how we responded to it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0187" n="Page0187"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: I don't know of anything. A couple of us that started work with the new
                    crowd came to the conclusion that they were, their viewpoint of USAID was a
                    reflection of the early '70s and New Directions and that USAID had moved into
                    private enterprise and capitalism to the detriment of all the New Direction
                    ideals of working with the rural majority and the poor, etc. The things that
                    they talked about, the things that they wanted briefings on were like echoes
                    from the '70s. There was an unwillingness or an inability to recognize what the
                    Agency had learned in the last 15 years, and more importantly, that host
                    governments in the LDC world had learned. And, that the LDC attempts to
                    dismantle some of the economic rules and regulations and change the rules of the
                    game, which came out of the Berg (Elliot Berg report on Africa, ed) report and
                    all the work done through the '80s on getting the government out of things and
                    allow local entrepreneurs to have a chance. They were very suspicious of, but
                    somehow the 12 years under Republican Administration had tainted everybody. We
                    were really all greedy capitalists trying to manipulate these countries into a
                    position where they could never develop. Whereas, what we ought to be doing is
                    putting money directly to work in rural areas and direct action programs, which
                    would make a difference in the quality of life—a tendency to see everybody who
                    had been there through Reagan and Bush as somehow tainted and the need to get
                    rid of those people and bring in fresh people and an unwillingness, in my
                    opinion, an unwillingness to recognize that the 12 years had happened, that the
                    world went on without Carter, the world went on without their political
                    appointees, and that not only had USAID changed, but the world had changed. Even
                    more importantly from what we did, that the LDC world had changed and that not
                    only were we active in the LDC world, we were also active in Eastern Europe and
                    the NIS and in Russia. And, this was a whole new ball game and each
                    Administration gets a set of dumb priorities, but you ought to recognize that
                    some progress was made in the last 12 years and the world was not the same world
                    it was as when you left in the early '70s. That was probably the most
                    substantive role I played.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you carried that on to August and September of
                        '93?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes, that carried up until August or September of '93. Then I went back
                    to the NIS as a special assistant to Barbara Turner on the NIS Program, Former
                    Soviet Union Program. I essentially came to the decision that I wanted to retire
                    probably around March or April and we worked out that I'd retire end of
                    September, 1994. So, the last period was with the NIS. It was an extraordinary
                    job and because Barbara had full faith in me, she just let me do anything that I
                    wanted to do, so the problem, I think was on my side. I was just burned out by
                    that point and I was tired of dealing with the State Department and I was tired
                    of dealing with the new group that had come in at USAID, who in my final
                    conclusion were not serious people. Atwood had come over as the Administrator
                    and he constantly built up expectations and then destroyed them, because he
                    would send out policy statements and policy papers, and make statements to the
                    troops, and have open forum meetings where he would say absolutely everything
                    that people wanted him to say.</p>
                <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                <p>He was very articulate, very dynamic, you know, USAID is positive, we've got a
                    great blah, blah, blah, blah. Then, he'd turn around and go back to this office
                    and let Larry Burns (AA for Management) make all of the decisions, who was his
                    new chief operating officer who knew absolutely nothing about development. He
                    thought USAID could be run primarily out of Washington and that you could run it
                    through a computerized system which he was going to develop called the New
                    Management System where you would put in performance factors and they'd get
                    multiplied by other factors and at the end of it the computer would rank all of
                    the countries as to who should receive budgetary funds, allocation of funds, and
                    that you really didn't need people overseas. He quickly worked himself into the
                    most hated man at USAID, simply because he really saw it as a mechanical kind of
                    activity and I saw no point of sticking around. I didn't have any fun any more
                    and I'd always said that I'd stay with USAID as long as it was fun. And, it was
                    not fun, it was painful every day. You felt like you were constantly fighting
                    fires to try and keep something from going off the tracks. But, while you were
                    working on one railroad, another railroad completely went off the deep end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. You retired after your last assignment with the NIS
                        countries and when did you retire?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: In August of 1994.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. And, when you were in retirement did you have any
                        special assignments of interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: In '95, I retired in '94 and before I retired the people in Science and
                    Technology had asked if I was available to participate in an evaluation. They
                    wanted me to go in August and I told them that I was retiring in August. They
                    said, well we'll get back to you. And, it turned out that the evaluation wasn't
                    until February and March of '95. I went with the Management Service Science,
                    Inc. and was doing evaluations for S and T, which became the Global Bureau and
                    participated in that and did—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The evaluations of what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0189" n="Page0189"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: The Global Science and Technology Bureau had a program which supported
                    linkages between American Universities and overseas universities. They had been
                    through three years of this linkage program and were starting into the next
                    round of award of grants. There was a fair amount of controversy as to whether
                    they were working or not working, or what exactly were they doing. So, the
                    Global Bureau sponsored an evaluation that looked at three linkage programs in
                    Africa, two in Mexico, and two in India. There was a six person team and we
                    divided up in to two people each and took a continent. I went to Africa along
                    with a lady from Tuskegee University. We did two linkages that were in Uganda
                    and one in Mozambique. Out of those, one in Uganda was totally off from its
                    original target, which was human rights linkages between the University of
                    Uganda Law School and Florida University. It had gone off into seven or eight
                    different avenues, none of which were in its original proposal. Then, there was
                    Uganda School of Medicine linked with Cleveland, Ohio, Western Reserve Medical
                    School and that one was just doing extraordinary well. It fulfilled every hope
                    in the original contract or the grant, which had University Specialists coming
                    out from Cleveland to Uganda working with the people in the Medical School,
                    primarily on epidemiological studies with a side specialty in HIV/AIDS, which
                    was a major issue. People from the University going to the United States for
                    short term seminars and training in specialized programs set up for them by the
                    University. They were linked, they had e-mail communications that were linked
                    back and forth and just very active, very alive, a very collegial kind of
                    relationship. Then, we went to Mozambique, which was a disaster for a totally
                    different reason, which was the Harvard International School. I can't remember
                    if it was IIS or just International. I think it was Harvard International
                    Institute of Studies or Science. It received a grant to work with the Mexico
                    Medical School.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Mozambique?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: No. Harvard received a grant to work with Mexico on medical issues. Part
                    of the grant was the idea of strengthening ties between third world countries.
                    So, Mexico did a link with the Mozambique Medical School. And, the people in
                    Harvard were advisors who over time got called into Mozambique. But, the people
                    in Mozambique never understood that theirs was a secondary grant to Mexico. They
                    were just totally confused. They felt that the contract with Harvard had been
                    technically abused, and in terms of strengthening or institutional contact, or
                    any of these linkages that were supposed to be happening, none had happened.
                    And, no one had linkages with Mexico. In the meantime, the weight of the grant,
                    anyone who knows an overseas underdeveloped institution, knows how precious
                    funds are. The situation in Mozambique had gotten so bad that the head of the
                    Medical School in Mozambique refused to sign the agreement with Harvard that
                    would free up his local currency. Because, Harvard would not give him an
                    accounting of where all the money in their grant was going. And, he felt that
                    there was too much chance of the grant funds being misused and that he would
                    then get blamed for it, but he had signed the local agreement, so he refused to
                    sign the local agreement. I think that the whole concept of the Mexico and
                    Mozambique relationships may have worked if they had been differently
                    programmed, because Mozambique was not that far from its independence. It was
                    very feisty and it had a chip on its shoulder about, we can do it, we don't need
                    outsiders help. And, the Mexican Medical School was fairly leftist and also, you
                    don't need outside help, you can do it all. So, emotionally there were some
                    problems. They just never understood the grant and they couldn't figure out how
                    come they never got any money in to the grant, or if they got any money in the
                    grant why Harvard wouldn't explain to them where the rest of the money was
                    going. And, the Mission had been unaware of this whole program, because it was a
                    Global S and T Bureau program initiative, which went to Harvard and Harvard had
                    contacts with Mexico.</p>
                <p>At the same time, the Mission was in the process of developing a fairly large
                    health sector plan, but they were a year and a half to two years away from it.
                    If the S and T grant had been done differently, it could have been a great
                    initiative in that whole sector, which would not have taken Mission money or
                    bilateral money. We could have given them a whole series of contacts and could
                    have developed a base of knowledge at Harvard that they could pull on. However,
                    it never happened.</p>
                <p>So, we came back from Africa and reported that two out of three links were
                    disasters and one was going well. Then, we found out that the team that went to
                    India felt those were going superbly, the team that went to Mexico, felt those
                    were going superbly, and so the final evaluation that was written up for USAID
                    said that they were working. I said, what do you mean they're working, there's
                    two out of the three that worked. They said, well, that it was Africa. These are
                    our advanced sophisticated grants which may not be appropriate for Africa. I
                    said, “No, no.” The problems involving the grants were not on the African side,
                    they were on the American side. I found out that the consulting agencies have
                    never really understood the order of clearances. So, when the team report gets
                    turned into a consulting company, you know, they're free to rewrite it however
                    they want to. I decided that I did not, I felt liked it so I'd retired.</p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>The evaluations would be a good way to use whatever knowledge I'd developed over
                    the years. And, after that exposure, I thought nope, evaluations are not the way
                    to go. One, because I was very frustrated at not participating and fixing what I
                    found wrong. That I wanted to go talk to people in USAID, the Mission about all
                    the things that I thought they should have done, which clearly was inappropriate
                    for a contractor to do. Secondly, because I felt that a report got written that
                    had my name on it over which I had very little editorial control. So, I decided
                    that my work with USAID had been interesting and for the most part,
                    extraordinarily challenging, but it was just time for me to walk away from it
                    and get on with my life. So, I didn't do anything more with USAID, and I really
                    didn't intend to do anything more with USAID.Q: On this University linkage
                    business, this wasn't linkage based on prior relationships between American and
                    developing countries institutions? What it sounds like is a new relationships
                    that hadn't existed before, is that right?</p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It varied. Each University had to write a proposal to USAID as to what
                    they would do. In some cases they did have a pre-existing link with the country.
                    Even in some cases they had callings at the school, but it really varied
                    tremendously. The grants to Florida State University were to work with Uganda,
                    human rights efforts under the law school. It was backed up by the fact that
                    Florida State University had been active in Uganda for many years. They had an
                    African studies program at Florida. They had recruited several Ugandans who
                    served on the school faculty, plus there was an extraordinary Ugandan who had
                    served as the patriarch of the school in Uganda. The human rights division in
                    the School of Law was a new division. The University of Florida's original
                    proposal was to work in environment. They were going to work through the
                    University Environmental School and work in environmental areas. When they
                    talked to the University in Uganda, they said that they'd really much rather
                    them help them develop a human rights division in the School of Law. So, Florida
                    said, fine, it's all to the good that this is your initiative and they set up
                    the arrangement. The arrangement was between the Florida and area of studies and
                    the Law School. Then, Florida pulled in some people from Florida Law School and
                    human rights activists. I am trying to think how to summarize their problems,
                    because most of the problems were in the terms of the grant on the American side
                    where essentially they were charged with writing quarterly reports to USAID
                    saying what they'd done and then reporting on how they'd used the budget.
                    Technically, those reports told the truth, except they didn't tell..... Once
                    you'd been in country and started talking to the Ugandans and then reread the
                    reports, you could see what they had glossed over and in between the lines what
                    they'd left out. So, the reporting mechanism was one of the main problems that
                    Florida was simply glossing over its problems in reporting to USAID. Secondly,
                    they had a lot of trouble convincing American professors to go to Uganda. So,
                    they came up with the idea of taking all the money that would have otherwise
                    been programmed for per diem expenses for staying a hotel. At that point, hotels
                    were not in good shape in Uganda, but they took the per diem money and built a
                    house and called it the Florida House. It was set aside for TDY visitors coming
                    from the U.S. and if anybody from the U.S. was there it could be used for
                    others. Meanwhile, the grants specifically prohibited any construction under the
                    grant and taking what would have been the per diem to pay for house sort of
                    stretched the interpretations really way off.</p>
                <p>The original purpose of the grant was more towards getting the Ugandan University
                    Law School involved with government in trying to establish a human rights record
                    of what was within the law in general terms. And, instead the main emphasis had
                    gone to developing an East Africa Law School and Publications on Human Rights.
                    Academically, the people in Florida thought that it was great, but it really
                    wasn't within the original terms of the grant. I thought it was far more
                    academic than intended. If their major effort was supposed to be working with
                    the government, it was going to be an extremely long range hands off point of
                    view. The original man who was heading it up; who was in the law school and
                    headed up the human rights division had quit and gone to London. The second
                    person who had headed up the rights division had come to the United States on a
                    scholarship. The man that...when we got there first of all, we could not
                    identify who we should talk to before we left the United States. I sent faxes,
                    e-mails and telephone calls, but nobody got back to us. We finally got one call
                    from the guy at Florida State University who suggested that we skip going to the
                    Uganda at all and just come down to Florida. So, we arrived and wondered whether
                    we would find a project there or not. We were immediately met in the grandest
                    tradition; we met two different groups of the Ugandans and that were fighting it
                    out in factions at the Law School for different faculty reasons. One met us at
                    the airport and took us to the hotel, and another showed up at the hotel later
                    that night, and both were eager to tell us the true story of what was going on.
                    What had happened is that the Law Schools or Universities or Institutions and
                    their bureaucracies had gotten all involved in bureaucratic in fighting on the
                    Uganda side as to who was going to get the status of having the degree and who
                    was going to be able to pass out scholarships. And, the publisher perish
                    syndrome had taken hold.</p>

                        anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: As I recall, I'm probably no longer accurate on my numbers, but there
                    were something like 13 colleges, universities, vocational schools that had
                    gotten grants under the first two year go around. And, there were another 13 who
                    had gotten them the second year. This was for the 26 grants outstanding and this
                    was in the third and fourth year at the time of the evaluation. The decision was
                    made not to evaluate the second group of 13, because they hadn't been active
                    long enough for it to work, but they did a desk audit of the first 13 and then
                    six of those had overseas evaluation. Essentially, the conclusion was that it
                    was too soon to tell whether or not they'd have any sustain ability. For the
                    most part, the universities had had prior contacts with the country, if not the
                    particular institution. There was a strong feeling that a link had been
                    established that would be sustained over time, but it was simply too early to
                    tell that the major issue of any sustainability over a long time was going to be
                    financed. And, the universities and host country institutions had worked to
                    create linkages on all other fronts, but neither side had figured out how they
                    would do the financing once the program finished. There was a fairly strong
                    recommendation in the report, as I recall that USAID should reconsider the two
                    year limit to the grant; that they simply wouldn't be long enough and that USAID
                    should provide more funds to assist it over a long term. They also felt that
                    this was an appropriate tool that could be extremely useful in countries which
                    were graduating or had graduated and for the advanced developed countries that
                    no longer received bilateral assistance from USAID. That this represented a way
                    to have U.S. involvement in the world to both help the country and bring back
                    from the country the perspectives of what was going on throughout the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think the program had support within USAID?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0193" n="Page0193"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: I think the program was basically unknown within USAID. As a large
                    institution, the different grants were mainly the concern of the different
                    Bureaus that gave the grants and in this case it was S and T or Global. It was
                    in a timeframe when Global was reorganizing and going through transition, and
                    pulling people in and pulling people out. As I understand it, under the old
                    organization there was a center that worked with colleges, a University Center,
                    under which this particular grant was monitored. That University Center was
                    combined with several other activities and ultimately Global set up a Center for
                    Human Resource Development. As I understand it, the University Center was sort
                    of an appendage that no one paid much attention to and its funding is fairly
                    small and that's about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big were these grants, roughly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I think they were all under a million. They varied, but I would say
                    anywhere from five hundred thousand dollars to a million. So, in terms of
                    USAID's overall funding, they are very small. Like in Mozambique, I could see
                    where this kind of a grant would have provided just an extraordinary insight in
                    resources for the Mission in developing its own bilateral major health sector
                    plan. Rather than providing funding for temporary assignments, project design
                    teams, the grant could have been given that linked Harvard and the local
                    university, etc. etc. etc. Wouldn't have counted as bilateral money, wouldn't
                    have committed the Mission to anything in terms of following up, it could have
                    been very useful. But, because it was laid out in isolation it was
                    irrelevant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, it wouldn't have required a lot of the programming
                        work over the long time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: No. From the American University's point of view, it wasn't peripheral.
                    It was the exactly what they wanted to do. So, I don't think that they were the
                    ones at fault. I think it was USAID who simply didn't give it enough thought to
                    how this could be used.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about other assignments?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: After I finished the evaluation, I stayed away and said no whenever
                    anybody talked to me. But, in early '97, Gary Nelson gave me a call who was a
                    friend of mine in USAID who had also retired and he'd been doing some consulting
                    work. He had to go to Madagascar for six months and he didn't want to take that
                    long, but he said he'd try and find somebody to help him and so he called me.
                    I'd said I'd try it, because the job was going to one place and staying there
                    long enough to have some impact on what happened. Secondly, because it was one
                    of the few countries in Africa that I'd never made it to; and third because part
                    of the trouble with evaluations for me anyway, was working at this third hand
                    distance. Working for a contractor who had a contract with USAID. And, in the
                    case of the Madagascar job, it would be a Personal Services Contract directly
                    between me and the Agency. So, I said yes and he worked out the details and I
                    went out to Madagascar from June to November of '97.</p>
                <p>The basic problem was that the Deputy Mission Director was moving up to the
                    Mission Director. At the same time the U.S. mission support team had been cut to
                    seven. Of the seven full time positions, five were vacant. Either because people
                    hadn't arrived at post yet, or people at post were taking home leave, and so it
                    was just the Mission Director and an International Development Intern (IDI),
                    there over the summer. Although some people stayed and some people left, it was
                    eventually a two person operation over the summer. They wanted somebody who
                    could come out and be jack of all trades, do whatever came up that needed doing,
                    as well as work with the economists to come up with a new strategy for their
                    program development process. When it was approved, it had four strategic
                    objectives under the new terminology. Overtime, the Agency put the squeeze on
                    the missions; if your country didn't qualify as a development case, you couldn't
                    have four objectives; you could only have two, etc. etc. Madagascar had had a
                    fairly good reform program in place with the IMF, but it had a series of
                    elections and internal political issues. They hadn't been meeting their IMF
                    requirements, so the Mission had put them on a watch list and then subsequently
                    USAID in Washington had said, well since they're on the watch list, you know, we
                    have to cut the staff, which is why it went from 14 to seven and their
                    objectives went from four to two.</p>
                <p>So, I went out there and found that I just thoroughly enjoyed it. It was highly
                    operational. It turned out that I really didn't get involved that deeply in the
                    strategy, in of writing the strategy. I was just a resource back-up person for
                    the economist, which I felt was good, because I think USAID made a mistake when
                    they turned strategy writing over to outsiders. At that point, I was an
                    outsider.</p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>The Mission's program was either being phased out or trying to move from four
                    objectives to two. They were trying to take things that they hadn't been doing
                    or had planned to do under some of the objectives and consolidate them. And,
                    they were winding up with two objectives; one in environmental programming and
                    one in health and population programming. Their agricultural activities they
                    were reworking to phase into the environmental side so that you would have a
                    combined environmental agricultural approach. And, their economic support
                    program that they had, I think to support the IMF reforms, was up in the air.
                    They didn't know what to do about it. For the first three months all I did was
                    provide support. I found that there were extraordinarily talented people
                    (Madagascans) out there and they really didn't need me, other than they needed
                    an American to say, yes that's fine. Then, when the American staff started
                    coming back, they were also very talented and very strong. The head of the
                    environmental/agricultural unit came back and I started working with her. I felt
                    their basic thrust on the environment was that as long as you did pure
                    environmental work, it simply would not be sustainable. People invaded the
                    protective lands, because they needed to for economic reasons. They needed to
                    chop down the wood for firewood, either to heat their own home or sell to the
                    Charcoal Company. They needed to eat the animals; they needed the space for
                    planting corn, which the animals would eat if they didn't kill the animals. It
                    was just all sorts of economic reasons as to why the hope to preserve some of
                    the protective areas was in trouble. You had preceded along the lines of trying
                    to find economic ways that were of use to local farmers in protecting the
                    habitats; Madagascar is the home of, I think about 400 species of plant and
                    animal life that don't exist anywhere else. So, there were major U.S. Private
                    Voluntary Organization initiatives there. I was trying to work with the Born
                    Free effort, which was pure environmental conservation and preservation.</p>
                <p>I worked with the government, which was primarily concerned about economic growth
                    and development but was beginning to see that there could be some advantages
                    from ecotourism. But it but felt that they needed to do something about the
                    farmers who lived in these areas and generate alternative employment for them.
                    It had the understanding of all the different active groups that were partially
                    concerned about what happened. Unfortunately, I thought their major mistake was
                    that they were repeating some of the things that happened in the Integrated
                    Rural Development programs, where certain areas were set aside for development.
                    In the Sahel and Africa, otherwise self contained, political units, were picked.
                    Agriculturally, you could help that group reach, move more quickly on the
                    development of these activities, but providing an insulation around it. So, that
                    it usually had special funding and special rights and special privileges under
                    the local government. I thought that the only significant weakness in Madagascar
                    was that they were setting up units to work on intermixing the economic activity
                    and environmental conservation activities, which in effect were being set up as
                    Integrated Rural Development programs. They weren't called that, but they had
                    the potential of having the same vulnerabilities. The other part of the
                    agriculture program that they were trying to mesh dealt with exports, working
                    with the different groups in Madagascar to promote exports.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: They're working on it is all I can say at this point. It was just too
                    new. They had gotten to the stage of setting up separate governing authorities.
                    They were having a series of public relations, public education meetings where
                    they were pulling together the local farmers and the environmental groups; they
                    had a link with some of the community development groups. And, then because the
                    agriculture program included work on export promotion, they had links to the
                    business community; they had representatives show up, but it was far too early
                    in the program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the health population initiative? Was that

                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The health population initiative was going great guns. I had very
                    talented local government folks to work with. While I was there some of them
                    were gearing up to get ready for a polio vaccination campaign. They had polio
                    vaccine and getting it around to all the different districts and then doing a
                    big public relations campaign with banners all over the streets. It seemed to be
                    going quite well. They were working with the Administrator of Health on various
                    outreach programs, and this particular one was polio vaccination. They had had
                    other outreach programs; they had a PL480 Title II Program that was run by the
                    Health Office where they tried to a blend school feeding program into other
                    health activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they have a centralized health system, primary health
                        system, district officers and all that ?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0197" n="Page0197"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: They did; they had the rhetoric or the philosophy of why the system
                    worked. My guess could be because it was an island. It was misleading. The
                    Minister of Health made (you know, and all countries probably should do it.)
                    made regular inspections and calls on different health units. In Madagascar,
                    although Madagascar rates as one of the poorest countries in the world. For a
                    good 25 to 50 year period, it was a major colonial capital. The country had all
                    of the initial investments. They had roads that go all over the place, they had
                    good schools buildings, they had all of the capital bricks and mortar
                    institutions in place. And, they had excellent ports and harbor facilities; they
                    had good airplanes, a good airport facility; a telephone system that ran all
                    over the country. And, they became one of the original laboratory areas for
                    USAID's initiatives on computers and the Internet access that was named for
                    Mickey Leland for the Leland Advisory. Actually, they had hired a Leland
                    coordinator for the Mission who was working on setting up a government unit and
                    a government telecommunication law. They had previously nationalized the
                    telephone service and they were moving to privatize the telephone service. The
                    Leland Advisory was working with them on that initiative; they had cyber cafes
                    and hotels to an extraordinary extent for a country that is nominally, in terms
                    of GNP one of the poorest in the world. They had a ten year stretch where
                    essentially the government wasted itself in to bankruptcy, and now it's trying
                    to work through its debt. The Ministry of Health is decentralized and in the
                    pattern of the government, they had decentralized many of their activities. But,
                    because it was an island it didn't have, I think the kind of impact it would
                    have in Botswana or Tanzania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were those the major programs, and family planning was
                        really well accepted?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Those were the major programs. Family planning was really well accepted.
                    The access to family planning, as I recall was not a controversial area. The
                    Mission was funding a campaign on AIDS, a public awareness of AIDS and safe sex.
                    I know they had a big PL480 nutrition activity going on.</p>
                <p>Because Madagascar is in the path of hurricanes and cyclones, they had almost
                    perpetual disaster relief going on for the eastern end of the island. I felt
                    they were doing really well in terms of setting up the disaster assistance that
                    led into some of the longer term programs, especially in the health area, which
                    I think happened, because health was the organizational unit that had the
                    management responsibilities for disasters. They were very creative in ways of
                    linking the disaster assistance to the ongoing health programs, both as
                    epidemiological studies and gaining knowledge about the general health and
                    nutrition of the area, as well as operationally strengthening Ministry of Health
                    in terms of what they provided to the area. They were beginning to work with the
                    agricultural people in finding ways to link the agricultural people to the
                    disaster service so that you could have longer term development effects.</p>

                    away from the politicians. The politicians would frustrate you. All they were
                    interested in was the relative political strength, but again, they had a really
                    strong technocrat level of government that wanted development to happen and were
                    trying to make development happen. The morale among the Madagascar USAID staff;
                    I have never been any place where the morale's as high. And, they all felt that
                    they made a difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I gather by the time you were there that the economic
                        reform process had broken down and the government was not following through
                        on its commitments.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Policy had broken down. The government has not followed the IMF reform
                    measures. The U.S. and other donors, six to eight months before I got there, had
                    a major demarche with the government, saying that their ability to help support
                    Madagascar would decline. So, for about six months the government had gone
                    through all of the initial stages of denying the IMF reforms that were needed
                    and it had come to the point of saying, well yeah they are needed and we will do
                    them, but we just can't do them as fast as you want them. So, during the six
                    months that I was there it was a question of trying to monitor the steps the
                    government was taking, trying to find out from other donors exactly how much
                    movement was occurring and, if any was occurring. In general, it was looking
                    pretty good.</p>
                <p>Ones tendency to hope that everything will work out, so I think there was a bias
                    on the hopeful side. There's always the point that they've taken a few steps.
                    The problem the Mission was having at the end was trying to convince Washington
                    that steps were being taken, because, at that point, Washington had already
                    phased down the staff support from 14 to seven. They had cut the budget and had
                    pretty much told the Mission to stay with the general theme of parks and
                    condoms, staying with the environment and population.. One of the funny
                    problems, ironically funny, is that because Congress felt very strongly that we
                    should be getting more involved in environmental issues and had for a long time
                    had very strong population and family healthy, you know, the lobby on health.
                    Nobody really wanted to cut the budget for Madagascar; the way in which the
                    African Bureau made its earmarks in two of the really tough categories. Nobody
                    wanted to move Economic Support Funds for economic growth into a democracy fund,
                    which is more earmarked or more broadly interpreted than are earmarks, and so
                    become very competitive in terms of countries trying to get them. And, that's
                    what the Mission was fighting with Washington about; that they needed to
                    continue to receive Economic Support Funds to work on the major economic issues
                    and some of the political issues. Like I said, I found, we were into
                    implementation and it was very much into implementation of some of the reforms
                    that Atwood and his crew had been talking about. I found myself just totally
                    with the wrong vocabulary. I asked for a copy of the projects and there was no
                    longer a list of activities by projects. You had lists of activities under
                    various supporting sector objectives and they were getting ready to do a
                    contract and go out for bids on the contract and I asked for the project paper
                    and they said, there is no project paper. And, I said, wait a minute, wait a
                    minute, wait a minute. How do you know what you're doing. Well, it's all written
                    into the contract.</p>
                <p>From a small point of view, they had major, major delegations of authority for
                    the entire program. The Mission had practically no delegation of authority on
                    the Operating .Expense side. Massive changes in all of the program documentation
                    in terms of how you identified for Washington what you wanted to work on and
                    then the field almost totally in charge of figuring out how to do it. But, out
                    of practically no delegation of authority. So, everybody else was trying to
                    manage for results and manage the outcome and keeping all of their paperwork on
                    that level. The Controller had to have paperwork on how much money did you get
                    and what was it spent for on the input side. The New Management System had just
                    totally collapsed, the computerized program which was supposed to bridge to the
                    country had totally collapsed. It was like being present at the evolution type
                    of thing. You could see the changes, changes were happening and they were moving
                    things much faster. I found myself being the conservative old type. Are you
                    really sure about what we have been doing?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you characterize the new programming system? What
                        are the basic concepts behind that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0199" n="Page0199"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Its purpose was in managing for results to set up the program so that
                    your eye is always on the outcome that this is where you want to end up five
                    years from now. I think I characterized it earlier that some of what the New
                    Directions did. This put more emphasis on results, and the purpose of the
                    project, for example, is to strengthen the Ministry of Agriculture. And, under
                    the New Directions policy, the purpose of the project is to strengthen the
                    Ministry of Agriculture so that it can provide Extension Services for small
                    farmers — the outward orientation in the management for results. It's taken that
                    the next logical step, which is the purpose of the project, is to strengthen the
                    Ministry of Agricultures so that it can provide extension outreach services for
                    the farmers so that they can grow more corn, or more sorghum, or more rice. And,
                    that your project is successful if more rice is grown, more corn is grown,
                    rather than being judged as a success because the Ministry of Agriculture has a
                    higher budget.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't we have those kinds of objectives in the projects
                        before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Sometimes they were there, but I think it's a question of flushing them
                    out and putting more emphasis and higher priority on them and making them more
                    conscious in terms of your talking to the contractors, talking to the
                    government. It becomes the subject and you work your way backward from, okay,
                    extension needs to grow more corn, how can that happen. Well, first of all we
                    could try and do a land reform or then we could do this. And, you work your way
                    from the statement of the problem back to what kinds of things you can do about
                    it. In many ways you still do the same things. You have a contract with the
                    University of Idaho that says, strengthen the Ministry of Agriculture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you have in the lieu of a project paper?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: You have the scope of work in the contract, which then becomes your
                    working document between you and whoever you hired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you know how much to fund it for?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I've never figured that out. In terms of figuring out how much money its
                    going to take to grow more corn, which is where the system ideally leads you,
                    they're not there yet. In terms of, (I'd been involved in other projects in
                    other countries) in other times you'd sit down with the contract team and the
                    contract team would tell you they'd never seen the project paper. That was an
                    internal lead document. And, what they were working off was the scope work in
                    the contract. There were some lawyers I know, and some controllers who have felt
                    very strongly that project papers are internal documents and they have tried to
                    say, it is illegal to show these to a contractor.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0200" n="Page0200"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly the budget.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: So, I think that this system makes for more open communications with the
                    people who write the implementation edge of your projects. I don't think they
                    have every issue solved. There is a huge gap between managing for results and
                    looking at your activities from our point of view, which now has a parallel
                    system of looking at your inputs and how much they cost, so that everybody is
                    really doing double duty. We have yet to convince Congress, but they have tried
                    to report to Congress on the basis of the sector objectives and the development
                    results and Congress said, how much money are you giving to the country. So, now
                    they do a country write up as an annex of appendix E or something. There's more
                    confusion with the Hill on what is the Agency trying to do and how many
                    countries is it working with, and is it really substituting geo-political issues
                    in the allocation of funds for development issues. And, on that one, I think
                    they are probably right. We need the geo-political; we look at the weighted
                    system as to how projects are supposed to be prioritized, you know, how they've
                    been built it into foreign policy objectives. And, that in itself, to me,
                    distorts the system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They always have.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Congress was always being suspicious of that particular element.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is it just a choice of where a program is concentrated as
                        a top dollar or a bottom buck or a mixture process? In the old days, people
                        thought that the priorities should be set by the Mission in the host country
                        that senses what the priority should be and where the focus should be based
                        on what the situation is in the country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I'd say it is still a mixture; partially influenced and warped in the
                    large big part by the Hill by what earmarks and language the Hill puts into the
                    legislation. It's also influenced and warped by the State Department in terms of
                    what they perceive or identify as our political interest. And, it is also
                    influenced by things that the USAID headquarters office does in terms of
                    staffing cuts, Operating Expense availability; what skills are on-call within
                    the Agency as opposed to outside the Agency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does the Agency then select a certain area that it wants
                        to concentrate on, program areas, like population health and
                        environment?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0201" n="Page0201"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: USAID has been for so long on the kick of consolidation that it's hard
                    to really tell what's different now from what was 20 years ago. The rhetoric is
                    pretty much the same that you want to focus, you want to concentrate, you want
                    to cut back on the numbers, the types of problems that the Agency works on. In
                    an effort to do that, for example, part of the reorganization of the Global
                    Bureau was to set up five Centers of Excellence, which would incorporate or
                    represent the five areas that the Agency was going to concentrate on. Due to
                    public outrage and political push, they added the sixth, which was Education and
                    Human Resources. They had originally put education development inside another
                    center, but they broke it out as a separate activity so that it could be tracked
                    better as to what we were doing in education development. So, the Global Bureau
                    wound up with six Centers and one special area of development: education and
                    human resources.</p>
                <p>The six Centers: I mean there is a 1) Center for Economic Growth and Development,
                    which they had incorporated with the agriculture area. And, there is a 2) Center
                    for Population, Health and Nutrition; there is a 3) Center for Environmental
                    issues; there is a 4) Center for Energy issues; there is a 5) Center for
                    Democracy (and Governance, ed) and 6) Education and Human resources. So, the
                    general themes are not that different. They didn't try and graft on a new area
                    that the Agency hadn't been working with already. The various initiatives that
                    people promote: either State Department wants us to do or somebody on the Hill
                    wants us to do, or that the Administrators decided that we should do it. They're
                    still both fairly broad; they're all over the map.</p>
                <p>You wind up, if you're a small program like Madagascar, doing the traditional,
                    volunteering to be the guinea pig for all the initiatives, so they got the
                    Leland coordinator. They volunteered to be one of the test sites for the
                    partnership arrangements between USAID and contractors; they volunteered to be a
                    lab for the new organizational arrangements. They wound up being eligible for a
                    whole variety of activities just because they were willing to volunteer. You
                    still wind up with a bilateral country program, which is described in some sort
                    of planning document, plus initiatives which were extraordinary and outside the
                    program, or which have been added to be part of the program, but only exist,
                    because there was a special category of funding. If you go back to the logic of
                    special initiatives with special funding, it is to promote and get started a
                    program that otherwise would have met a lot of resistance; an array of issues,
                    which the Agency still faces.</p>
                <pb facs="0202" n="Page0202"/>
                <p>It is the same problem that when McPherson came in, McPherson got a lot of good
                    publicity from the Republicans and a lot of creditability with the Republicans
                    on the Hill by a public relations stunt of taking back funds from countries that
                    had not been expended. And, wrapping those all up into, I think, 16 million
                    dollars; he had this huge check made up. It was like ten feet long and four feet
                    wide, and there was a picture of him at the White House presenting the check
                    back to the Treasury in front of President Reagan. Everybody within the Agency
                    regarded it as a stunt. In many cases, the projects still needed that money. It
                    didn't make sense to take it away, and others, yeah the money was available and
                    would ordinarily be deobligated over time, you know, why make a manpower
                    headache out of it by pushing to have it all done by a certain day. But,
                    McPherson got a lot of personal creditability from the Republican side of the
                    Hill and from the President in the White House.</p>
                <p>I think Atwood did the same thing in terms of a much valued initiative of closing
                    down missions, of cutting back on the number of overseas missions and wound up
                    closing thirty some posts. I think because of that he got a lot of creditability
                    with the Democrats and the Republicans, that this was a new tough management and
                    that he was really going to concentrate and straighten out problems. I don't
                    think it's worked. I think in most of those countries where we officially closed
                    out a mission and pulled the staff back, we wound up scrambling to find other
                    kinds of initiatives that could be done through the Global Bureau, like the
                    university linkages program, (cited above, ed.) So, one of the big issues in the
                    Global Bureau was who's responsible for countries after we cut bilateral
                    relations and what criteria do we use in deciding what the relationships would
                    be. That actually is one of the issues that's in my current contract with the
                    Global Bureau to be worked on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other things that you worked on before we wind
                        up; after Madagascar?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: After Madagascar, I came back to the States. I was energized, you know,
                    on working with USAID and doing something. Barbara Turner called me up and asked
                    me if I would be interested in working in the Global Bureau. She was moving over
                    to the Global Bureau as the new DAA and was very interested in my in doing some
                    work for it, and I said, yes I definitely would. So, all of my earlier ambitions
                    about not wanting to work directly for the Agency; that it would be better if I
                    worked through a third party, turned out to be wrong, and that it's much better
                    to just go back and work directly with the Agency. There is a point at which you
                    have to tell yourself that you're a contractor. You are not a program employee
                    and you have to be willing to step back in some areas and let people who are
                    junior officers learn, the way I learned when I was a junior officer. You can't
                    take over from people just because you've done it ten times and you can do it
                    again; it's no big deal. For them it's a big deal and it's exciting and they
                    want to do it. I think as a contractor you have to keep reigning yourself in on
                    those kinds of areas. But, right now I have done two short-term jobs for the
                    Global Bureau and they're talking about doing some more and I would be more than
                    interested in doing something.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Various ad hoc subjects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: They are ad hoc subjects; they're almost all with USAID's internal
                    organization and applications; I wanted to take advantage of things I had done
                    through the 30 years. I found that one way to do that was on these short term
                    jobs by just talking with people. To some extent, it is like getting two guys
                    together and they tell old war stories. And, at the same time, there's
                    information channeled that you pass on. There are some things that I use to do
                    that I'm very good at, like strategic planning. I don't think it's appropriate
                    for an outsider to do. They're to come in and write a paper and leave is not
                    what the strategic plan is all about. And, no strategic plan, that works it's
                    because you spent a lot of time talking people into agreeing that that's where
                    you want to grow the program.</p>
                <p>I spent a lot of time and energy on the implementation and support of that
                    particular approach. So, in my opinion, I think I'm the best strategic planner
                    that the Agency turned out. I don't think that I'm terribly creative, but I
                    think I'm a hell of a sensitizer or I can spot patterns and say, that's true
                    over there, and this is true over here, then if we did this here, you know, type
                    of relationship. It's fun, I like doing it. It's like putting crossword puzzles
                    together. But, I don't think that is as useful a talent for an outsider to bring
                    the bear. For some of the areas I can just historically say, these are the
                    different things that USAID had tried and these seem to have these problems and
                    those seem to have that problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That opens up an opportunity to look back over your
                        career. What are the lessons over the 30 years or so of your work that you
                        feel stand out as universal lessons or conclusions that still guide you when
                        you approach development issues and approaches and new programming? It's a
                        broad subject, but maybe there are certain things that stand out, mostly at
                        the project level, but also at the level of strategies on which you've done
                        a lot of work,?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The major one, the lesson that I would pull out of it, that I would
                    reemphasize anytime you go back into it is: you have to pay attention to what
                    the host country wants. It is far too easy to get ahead of the country and then
                    you get to the point where you're more invested in the success or failure of the
                    program or the project of the country.</p>
                <p>That lesson, I think, actually started in Ghana 30 years ago. We had a program
                    analysts at U.S. Office of Management Budget (OMB) who was absolutely certain of
                    the fact the U.S. shouldn't provide more than 50 percent of all donor assistance
                    to any country. They use to make us go through these endless exercises in Ghana
                    of trying to figure out how much assistance the U.S. was providing, versus
                    somebody else providing and always keeping the U.S. at 49 or 50 percent. And,
                    given the fact that donors differ in terms of obligation accounting, expenditure
                    accounting or pledging, it's just in many ways a paperwork exercise.</p>
                <pb facs="0204" n="Page0204"/>
                <p>But, in other ways, in looking back I think he was right that the U.S. makes a
                    mistake when it becomes a major donor. It's like the old song about, if I owe
                    you six hundred dollars I've got a problem, if I owe you six million dollars,
                    you've got a problem. We wound up that we had so much investment in Vietnam that
                    we couldn't control the Vietnam government, because they knew that we weren't
                    going to pull out, because of our major investment. The easiest mistake to make
                    is that because the U.S. cared about something so much or that we think it's so
                    important to achieve, that we wind up with our investment being, either
                    financial investment or emotional investment, greater than that of the host
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about in program areas like population where the
                        country is not aware of a problem or for whatever reason is unwilling to
                        address it or didn't want to get involved or accept advice on the program
                        area and yet it's something that you knew was important. How do you deal
                        with this gap between what our understandings are and what we think is
                        important and we know it's going to be a big issue and what the country's
                        view is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Population and family planning probably represents the best example of
                    the USAID's efforts to change the situation; introducing and accelerating a
                    change that we saw as beneficial and positive. If you look back at it, I think
                    the population and family planning people made some initial mistakes in terms of
                    going faster than the host country really wanted to go. Ghana was one of the
                    first countries in Africa that had government support for family planning. And,
                    the U.S. funded contraceptives for the country. I remember Burt Gould (USAID
                    Mission Program Officer in the 70s,ed) telling me about a trip he made up to
                    Northern Ghana where everybody in the Mission was on standing orders whenever
                    they went out on TDY's to various places in Ghana to check and see what was
                    happening with contraceptives, because they'd had a major breakthrough of
                    letting drugstores sell contraceptives. And, so everybody was supposed to go
                    into a drugstore and find out where the contraceptives are. Were they on the
                    shelf, available or were they underneath in a closet, you know, how easily were
                    they accessible. So, Burt told the story, it's a long involved story, but the
                    punch line was, the pharmacist had foam contraceptives which he was selling as a
                    form of shaving lotion, an instant greasy matter that you could put on your face
                    that would let you shave more easily. I think that happened throughout the
                    family planning, nutrition, health period where a lot of it was spent on public
                    education or educating policy makers in getting policy makers to see what was
                    happening and then moving into the logistics of implementing it. I remember the
                    population people use to have a Rapid Assessment program that they did. They
                    would go around to various countries and show to the decision makers that if
                    your population growth rate continued at a certain level, these were the number
                    of schools that you had to build in order to educate them. These were the number
                    of teachers that you had to train in order to staff the schools. Just portraying
                    the implications of demographic growth and letting people see what the results
                    were. It was not necessarily carrying a message of, you have to do this, but a
                    message of, look this is a problem. You can work on the problem anyway you want
                    to, but the problem is this and family planning is one way to address it and
                    increase training of teachers is another way to do it.</p>
                <pb facs="0205" n="Page0205"/>
                <p>The Agency made public discussion of family issues and population growth
                    legitimate development issues in terms of having the studies, e.g. in the Uganda
                    and the information so that you could talk about it. In many cases, the U.S.
                    government's tendency is to throw money a problem. And, people put more money
                    into the population programs than they could really use for public education,
                    demonstration. Then a lot of that money wound up going for funding
                    contraceptives that went in the back of closets and never got used or the
                    classic one that showed up in all the studies, like in Egypt where the condoms
                    got used as balloons for birthday parties.</p>
                <p>There are rates at which you can move and pour more money into a problem, but it
                    doesn't necessarily accelerate the rate of acceptance. You can be creative and
                    you can use the money in a lot of different ways to attack the problem and set
                    it up as an experimental situation where you expect eight out of ten to fail and
                    then push on the two that were successes. The Agency has never been in a good
                    position to talk with Congress. We were the experimental agency, but we've never
                    really sold that to the funding agencies. So if we try ten different things then
                    we better have a pretty good understanding or reason that all ten will work.
                    And, if eight fail then somebody in USAID failed. And so there's that problem in
                    introducing change.</p>
                <p>One of the things about population and family planning that we did in the Africa
                    Bureau, was it was to introduce it along with a health module, if you will,
                    where it was doctors talking to doctors; it was talking about the health
                    implications for mothers; it was talking about family spacing as opposed to
                    family planning. Just an arrangement so that family planning and health became
                    synonymous. The staff that did health did family planning. The bureaucratic
                    group that was responsible for one was responsible for the other. There's a lot
                    of evidence that show that there were other avenues that could be used.
                    Education of women. Show the clear correlation to desired family size and actual
                    family size. I was trying to think of another good example now besides the
                    education. In general, I think the USAID was; it was intellectually a lovely
                    place to work, because you had bright people who were concerned about issues and
                    who tried to figure out ways to work on those issues. In some cases, like
                    population of family planning, it became a force in of itself in changing the
                    opinion on the Hill, changing legislation, as well as changing how the issues in
                    development were framed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you have any other area?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0206" n="Page0206"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: I think the environment is beginning to be one of those areas. I don't
                    think it has happened yet, and I think initially the whole push for environment
                    was much more of a Hill initiative, but after the Hill pushed it, the USAID
                    started hiring people in that area and they became an internal lobby for it, as
                    well as an education lobby of showing how environmental issues were relevant to
                    success in other fields. Much like population did with the Rapid Assessment
                    Projections. The environmental people had done with pushing natural resources.
                    If forests keep being cut down at the rate they're being cut down, you know, it
                    will be X number of years before they are exhausted. And doing the basic
                    statistical analysis helped create public education and awareness.</p>
                <p>I think in energy that we have the people who are talented enough to do that, but
                    it has not become a main line issue. For example, the Mission Director in
                    Tanzania, Vern Johnson, was worried about agriculture. That as long as people
                    are limited in what they could plant, harvest, take care of by the within the
                    limits of their own physical energy, you were never going to get basic reform in
                    the agriculture sector. Trying to introduce animal energy into the equation or
                    trying to introduce tractors into the equation; finding ways to attack that
                    energy limitation. I think we were on the right track. I think the energy people
                    ought to be much stronger within the Agency than they currently are. The
                    agricultural people wound up being the ones who fended off bad ideas. That their
                    overseas experience became the barrier at the gate that helped kill crazy ideas,
                    in terms of being practical people who had a feel for what would or wouldn't
                    work. So, I think they've kept the Agency on numerous occasions from going down
                    the wrong trail. I don't know other than, the massive publicity that went to the
                    Green Revolution in Asia, that the agricultural staff had, as a group, an impact
                    on host country ways of thinking and doing business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about other areas of lessons and conclusions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: The Agency should continue to be primarily a country focused overseas
                    mission focused Agency. I think that's the unique talent and skill that we can
                    all add to the equation. I think, in recognition that 30 years ago, you were the
                    only game in town; that's not true any more. There are a number of other
                    American institutions and groups functioning overseas, ranging from private
                    sector, private volunteer organizations, individual entrepreneurs, universities,
                    immigrant sponsored groups. There's just a lot of links, if you will, between
                    the U.S. and the rest of the world and that USAID probably will continue. I
                    don't see any alternative; I think the merger of USAID with State came as close
                    during this last couple of years as it has ever been and the fact that it stayed
                    an independent Agency, it will pretty much stay an independent Agency. I fear
                    growing interference from State, but I think that will be less and less
                    important, because I think USAID will continue to be the important funding
                    source, as well as an operational source. But, I really see it being a smaller
                    player in interacting relationships.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's just talk a little bit about the relationship of
                        both State and USAID which is essentially the relationship of
                        political/security interests and the development interest. Do you feel that
                        they are in conflict and that the political security interest priority
                        undermines the efforts to deal with development issues or do they complement
                        each other? What's the relationship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I think the political/security interest in geopolitics warps USAID, in
                    terms of people being assigned to work on certain problems, in terms of funding
                    available for the staff, the priorities. It warps the funding for the staff, and
                    it warps program funding, because I don't think large amounts of program money
                    are really that critical. I think the tendency of Americans is to throw money at
                    problems; so when you have big geopolitical problems, you immediately want to
                    put a lot of money on that problem, to the detriment of the development
                    activities which could use the money for the development programs, but you still
                    do the other activities. You do them at a lower rate, you try and finagle other
                    donors, etc. etc. But, I think the main problem is that the geopolitical
                    problems are a category where we care more than the host government does. We
                    have to save Somali. No amount of money we put in; no Marines landing on the
                    beach. To save Somali at that particular point and time when Somali was tearing
                    itself apart. You can do emergency assistance which helps ameliorate some of the
                    agony that the innocent stand-byers suffer, but in effect when you do that you
                    are also lowering the pressure on the local groups to find a solution, to the
                    extent that they care about their people at all. If they don't care about their
                    people, you probably wind up with them stealing the supplies, which then enables
                    them to continue hiding them as opposed to running out of food and drink.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: This reminds me of a college freshman course I took. I can remember the
                    professor doing a very dramatic theatrical type of thing, other than being a dry
                    lecture. He was talking about the big debate in the Hill and Congress: who lost
                    China, who was to blame for losing China. And, the witch hunt that went on with
                    the State Department and the Hill and various other places. His question was,
                    China was never ours to lose. Why ask the question?</p>
                <p>It was a very similar situation in Somalia. Somalia wasn't ours to lose and it
                    really wasn't ours to save. I think for all of the immediate public sympathy
                    that goes to the pictures of the starving people that went to Biafra during the
                    Nigerian Civil War. It really doesn't help.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean we shouldn't be providing humanitarian
                        assistance?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0208" n="Page0208"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: I don't see anyway that we could step aside from it very honestly. I
                    think it's a characteristic of the American culture and one that in most cases,
                    you know, I think it's a positive attribute that we have of wanting to go in and
                    help. We need to be more realistic about what we can help with. I think there is
                    a growing body of people who actually have worked in enough emergencies to where
                    they can take the concern that is generated by the emergency and move it for
                    programs which have a more lasting impact or beginning to set up a foundation
                    for a lasting impact. Emergency feeding programs that don't interfere with local
                    growth and pricing of products. If the U.S. was more flexible, which it has
                    gotten over the years in terms of a crop failure in Zimbabwe resulted in U.S.
                    shipping our excess commodities to Zimbabwe. We got better at seeing
                    inter-reactions in programming when we got approval to buy corn in Tanzania,
                    which was having a surplus year. Sell the Tanzania corn to the Zimbabweans As we
                    begin to figure out those relationships, I think we've gotten better at what we
                    do. Although there's been a lot of loosening of the purse strings, if you will,
                    there's still a large feeling that if we do something to help others in a short
                    term, it ought to help the rest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that how our objectives get mixed up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes. I remember one discussion I had, there is one type of policy put
                    into the legislation or into USAID internally, that you will buy 50 million
                    dollars worth of John Deere equipment, and then we look for places overseas
                    where we can peddle the John Deere equipment. But, that's a totally different
                    approach from working with the host government and deciding that U.S. tractors
                    are appropriate due to the soil situation and rainfall situation, and tractors
                    from John Deere are competitive and so you wind up buying tractors from John
                    Deere. In both cases, you wind up with the same product, but for very different
                    reasons and analysis. Again, USAID is a promoter of American enterprise and
                    investment as opposed to USAID as a promoter of establishing an environment that
                    is conducive to investment. You know, I think one works better than the other,
                    but it is successful and ends up at the same place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is the interaction of the political/security and the
                        development interests? Any other aspects of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I don't see that they ever fade or go away. I think USAID compounds the
                    problem frequently by saying that we can do both. We can respond to the
                    geopolitical imperative and actually also achieve development objectives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you find that there is a difference of perspective in
                        terms of time frame in which one wants to see results between the State
                        Department's political/security interests and USAID's development
                        interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0209" n="Page0209"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Very much so. I think I've commented on it before, as the State
                    Department looks for immediate impact. Some of which has a publicity, a photo
                    opportunity. They're intelligent, they're super intelligent in some ways. They
                    will not argue whether or not the problem that you're raising is a real problem
                    or not. Frequently, they just take the tact, we'll worry about that six months
                    down the road; we'll worry about that two years from now. They really do define
                    their goals and objectives in a very short operational timeframe, We are blessed
                    with people like Harriman or Marshall, who in the early days of the Marshall
                    Plan had a longer term view. But, for the most part, State's internal pressures
                    and reward system goes for keeping the problem under control, not solving
                    problems. Honestly, they talk about USAID and the State merging. Their two
                    corporate cultures are different. If they merged, I think the USAID approach
                    would go elsewhere. It would find its voice or its avenue in the various
                    universities or the lobby groups on the Hill. I don't see the State Department
                    changing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Another dimension of your experience that you would
                        like to comment on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I think the other thing on the geopolitical side: I would say that the
                    Eastern Europe and Russia and the Newly Independent States program is probably
                    the best expression of geopolitical needs driving fund allocations. I think that
                    the Agency and the U.S. were extraordinary lucky in having talented people from
                    USAID who worked on that. And, whether they were in Russia, or Malcolm Butler
                    here in the States, and certainly Barbara Turner. I think they did a lot to
                    speed up USAID methods of working to try and meet the State Department's
                    repeated, to me, obsession about results. After working on that program, I will
                    admit that if left to itself, USAID could happily fund studies, study after
                    study, after study. A classic example being OMVS, the Senegal River
                    Organizational involving Senegal, Mali and Mauritania, all three of which had
                    interests in putting up a dam on the major river that flowed through all three
                    countries, and which resulted in, Dr. Adams' expression of office buildings
                    being built in order to hold studies (by various donors and the OMVS, ed.) that
                    were done.</p>
                <p>The State Department does provide a good emphasis, that you should do something
                    now, don't just study the problem. USAID in many ways has been shell shocked by
                    having tried things that failed or tried good things and had unintended bad
                    results. There is very much the reaction of once burned, twice shy. Some of that
                    shyness is valid, you should learn from lessons in the past, and some of it is
                    just they don't want to go through the chaos of congressional queries and audits
                    and everybody jumping up and down and second guessing on the sideline. So, if
                    somebody is likely to second guess, they do a study about it before hand.</p>
                <pb facs="0210" n="Page0210"/>
                <p>One of my bosses, (who was actually a very, very good boss) used to say that if
                    you wanted to know how to get to Chicago, and he was the most imaginative and
                    creative person I knew in figuring it out: you could go by train, you could go
                    by canal boat, you could go by airplane, and figuring out all the ways in which
                    you could get there and what the various costs and draw backs and time would be.
                    If you asked about going to Houston, he would give you a range of the problems
                    involved and how you could get there. If you asked him whether you should go to
                    Chicago or go to Houston, he'd go back and do more studies on the how, rather
                    than the why. And, that you'd get to a point where you have to pick Chicago or
                    Houston, and the study itself wouldn't tell you which one to pick. I think the
                    State Department provides a good approach that pushes USAID to go ahead and take
                    some action. As much as I criticized them in their short term time frame, I
                    would also criticize USAID for having the ultimate long range term plan of not
                    wanting to do anything until they'd studied it to death.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, as you say, the studies have grown out of the
                        experience that some things might or might not work or you didn't know
                        enough about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yeah. You want to raise the income of people in Calarn so you want to do
                    a project that will generate jobs. The result is that they will then leave
                    agricultural farming, come into a city and take a job that will raise incomes,
                    which looks like a desirable thing to do. The unintended consequence of it is
                    that it leaves behind women and children who become a single family head of
                    household type of problem, that the income that is generated in the city is used
                    by the men to drink and gamble and does not flow back to the farm and the women
                    and children. Studies have shown, in many cases, that, if you generate jobs for
                    women, the money that they earn is much more likely to be invested in the family
                    for better health, more education. No one in their right mind would do a project
                    with the goal of the project to raise money for men to increase taverns and such
                    places.</p>
                <pb facs="0211" n="Page0211"/>
                <p>There are unintended consequences of some of the projects we did. We had an
                    organization with associated jobs; we've pulled men in to the city, but didn't
                    offer families any place, you know, that's what happened, an unintended
                    consequence. Part of that USAID has learned to cope with more comprehensive
                    studies to begin with. They learned to cope by putting in the project papers
                    funds that could be used to cope with some of those unintended consequences as
                    they show up; and by more effective monitoring what the results of the projects
                    were as opposed to monitoring did the money that was supposed to go to equipment
                    actually go to equipment; and by monitoring the impact of who got the equipment,
                    how was it used, and what were the environmental consequences. USAID has gotten
                    smarter and more sophisticated through experience and has ways to try and cope
                    with some of the problems that I had identified as coming from State
                    Department's rush to move fast. I don't think we have a good methodology of
                    teaching USAID staff all the knowledge that's been gained. It mainly is
                    transmitted by personal experience and then by word of mouth, and by calling on
                    colleagues' work, if you will, hey, I know Tom used to work in the Philippines,
                    and he worked on a problem like that, talk to Tom; where you do it all
                    informally. I know Al Hoban who was anthropology professor from Boston
                    University, he said USAID used up its own human capital faster than any Agency
                    he had ever seen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does that mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: They were hiring a person because he was technically competent, well
                    trained at the edge of his field. They would send him for six years into the
                    boondocks where he becomes six years out of date in his field and three years
                    later retiring him, but never investing anything in bringing his knowledge back
                    up to where it was when they really hired him. He would use the example that in
                    the military services the statistics show that 30 percent of your time — if you
                    have 20 years in the military—that 30 percent of your time is spent in actual
                    formal course work, going to the defense institute, going to the navy
                    intelligence institute, going to Harvard University. That another third of your
                    time is spent in more informal learning situations. In USAID you don't get
                    either, you don't get the formal; you don't get the informal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: USAID did have a development studies program and they did
                        have people sent off for training, I guess. But, I guess that's fairly
                        small?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: In 30 years with USAID and I had six months at the Foreign Service
                    Institute on economics; I had two weeks at the Senior Management Course on how
                    to be a good manager, and I probably had a total of three months training under
                    the Senior Executive Service Training Program that's where you go down to the
                    Federal Executive Institute in Charlotte or up to the Kings Point Civil Service
                    Institute. So, I spent ten percent of my time.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0212" n="Page0212"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel that there are many people that come in who
                        are interested in what's happened before and learn about what's worked or
                        not worked or do you find it hard to get people interested in past
                        experience ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I really can't decide. In working on the transition with the Clinton
                    people, I presumed there would be a lot of interest in not talking about the
                    history and what happened when and why and what some of the issues were. There
                    was an equally strong feeling of, like to get rid of the old dinosaurs, the ones
                    who prevent new thinking. I think political appointees showed an unwillingness
                    to listen, you know, to what they thought was a great new idea and find it had
                    already been tried before. At the same time they had a lot of curiosity about,
                    what's gone on in the past; how come countries aren't developed. I think some of
                    that does exist. There was a point in time within USAID when people thought they
                    had the answer to development and, more recently, so did the economists. They
                    thought if you put the economic policies in place, everything else flows, it
                    works; very true. Except in the Somalia, the IMF guy say, it really doesn't
                    matter what policy they adopt, because they don't have the institutions to carry
                    it out. You have a strong push for democracy and the rule of law, contract
                    rights, land titles, so that, if you get that system set up, the country will
                    then work out its own problems and development will happen. People keep looking
                    for the silver bullet (I don't go as far as Ken Sherper in saying that
                    everything that USAID does is new and that it is new to this country and to this
                    set of people). But, I think, there is a lot of what works in one country is
                    different from what works in another. You take what you can from what you can
                    learn and you use that and figure out what else you need to know. Much more, you
                    get pragmatic. I don't think that your economic policy or democracy policy
                    represent the ultimate answers. If I had to pick an ultimate answer, I'd pick
                    education. If you could only do one thing, I'd do education and primarily
                    starting off with bringing people to the United States for graduate studies and
                    then if you had enough money and you could do it, work your way down to
                    universities and then work your way into the host country on educational policy
                    of trying to promote policies that would have an impact.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You found that the case?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0213" n="Page0213"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes. That's partially based on going to Somalia, Sudan and Uganda and
                    finding that the lasting remnant of what we used to do there were the people who
                    had somehow had had contact with the U.S. under the old program. They'd trained
                    at Idaho; they'd trained at Salt Lake City, what have you. And, partially it is
                    due to educational institutions by their own internal cultures and mandates are
                    more open to keeping records about what's happened and looking at it and seeing:
                    are there any lessons you can learn and being self-analytical. I think those are
                    valuable skills that anyone who comes to the States for any kind of technical
                    education, picks up that general approach to a problem. I think that kind of
                    problem-solving approach is in many ways what differs us from the French or from
                    the Scandinavian countries. There has been a lot of discussion that third
                    country education is more efficient and it's less costly and it's much better to
                    send someone for veterinary training to the University in Senegal where the
                    conditions are closer to what they are in Cameroon, and they speak French, so
                    the guy gets his training in French, and he comes back and he does have a
                    technical base that he didn't have before. But, he's missed the whole exposure
                    to an education in problem-solving —an educational approach based upon
                    establishing your baseline data and look at what happens, so then you can tell
                    what you should have been doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's turn to another direction Do you think over the 30
                        years that you've been involved and looking back on the overall Foreign
                        Assistance Program, has it made a difference in the world of development or
                        in developing countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It's been like a roller coaster ride. Sometimes you are really up high
                    and you're having a lot of impact, and then sometimes you're headed straight
                    downwards. And, you're watching what you worked on so hard and find it working
                    and then wiped out. I think of the Rwanda: there were development efforts by the
                    donors as well as USAID that had really worked in Rwanda and had in many ways
                    had had an impact upon the country; a promising future. It was graded as one of
                    the countries in Africa that could really make it and then it went straight down
                    into hell on earth as the internal tribal fights broke out.</p>
                <pb facs="0214" n="Page0214"/>
                <p>One of the things in Madagascar that made just an incredible impression on me was
                    the high morale of the local hire staff and how they were really convinced that
                    they were making a difference in Madagascar. I think that USAID succeeds when it
                    has local nationals, who, because of USAID backing or because of USAID funds,
                    really feel that they've had an impact on their country. I think the ultimate
                    test of whether USAID should continue, or matters enough to where you want to
                    keep it going, really comes from the host countries to the extent that they feel
                    that what we do is beneficial or that the people that we have had impact on over
                    the years feel that we can help solve a problem, and really make a difference.
                    And, as the economist at Yale, who worked a lot on development use to say, our
                    money didn't get our viewpoint accepted, our money got us a seat at the table so
                    that we could then present our viewpoint. I think USAID made a difference in
                    what got discussed at various tables, both in the formal governments and
                    informal institutions. I think they made a difference in what topics were
                    discussed, what solutions were discussed or how much attention was paid to a
                    problem that we perceived as being critical that other people didn't think was
                    that important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Such as?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Population was the very best example. I've used it before, but it was
                    something that we felt was important and that we didn't have to convince other
                    people it was important. I think Elliott Berg and the whole push to private
                    sector, entrepreneurship of getting the government out of certain things and
                    having the government regulations changed is another excellent example of where
                    we've put something on the table. In this particular case, it was an Elliot
                    Berg's study on Africa for the World Bank. So, in the end, it wasn't us who made
                    the light shine in midst of darkness, but we, as a donor and as a country,
                    really saw to it that what Berg was getting out and the issues that he raised
                    were the subject of discussion in more places, and had more impact than the
                    World Bank would have had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about other areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Human Rights. I think Carter, when he tried to make human rights part of
                    our overall foreign policy projections and relationships, made a major
                    difference in the State Department and the diplomatic interchange. Although the
                    State Department tried to keep human rights as something that it had; it wanted
                    to program human rights money. Inevitably, as long as it was a foreign policy
                    concern we started incorporating it in our dialogues and I think that's made a
                    difference. Again, initially in the places where you can show USAID made a
                    difference in what was talked about and what was on the table.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about in Africa and the Sahel; one of the things you
                        worked on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0215" n="Page0215"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: I think it made a difference in terms of institutional capacity to
                    handle droughts and emergency disasters. I think we made a contribution in terms
                    of increased training of the manpower base of who, in those countries is still
                    there, can worry about the problem. We didn't make a difference, e.g. in that
                    Niger remains a very poor country sitting in the middle of the Sahel Desert and
                    on the border of the Sahel Desert. Unfortunately, it will never be a Nigeria. It
                    just does not have the natural resources. I think because we were there the
                    people have a better chance of making use of their resources, but whether that
                    glass is half full and sustainable or like Rwanda development work vanishes
                    overnight. No bets.</p>
                <p>There is nothing inevitable with the U.S. assistance. I think at one point in our
                    history, we saw development almost as evolutionary, that you move from this
                    stage to that stage, from that stage to that stage and that development was an
                    absolute good that would occur even though the intermediate stages were painful.
                    I don't think that's true, I don't believe that anymore. I think that
                    development is not something that will automatically, at some point, happen. We
                    still have the pockets in Appalachian, Texas, California. Lord knows there's
                    been enough publicity about the educational issues inside the United States and
                    what's happening. You don't find permanent solutions in major problem areas.
                    What you're looking for, if you're lucky, are is people who are willing to make
                    a commitment to work on an issue and then you let a thousand flowers boom. You
                    tried as many different ways as you could figure out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this leads us to your thoughts on how you size up
                        your experience in foreign assistance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It has been extraordinary. I worked for a number of very good bosses. I
                    worked on a range of interesting problems and that at an age of 28 or 30 years
                    old, the Agency had a lot of faith in me and put a lot of responsibility on me.
                    As I look back at it, I can't think of doing anything else. There's absolutely
                    no sense of here's another career that I wish I'd done and I'm sorry that I
                    didn't do it and now I'll go do it. I can't identify anything I would have
                    rather spent my life working on. There are a range of problems that you spend 30
                    years knocking your head against the wall trying to figure out solutions and at
                    the end of that you're going to have a headache and that's all you can show for
                    it. But, as a significant problem, you're having a 30 year headache. I can't
                    think of a problem like the developing countries and the range of pain and agony
                    and starvation that still is rampant. There are sections of Cameroon where you
                    still have human slavery; there are section of Sudan where the U.S. tried to
                    start a major initiative to help orphans and we kept sending these cables back
                    to Washington explaining that the orphanage that they wanted to give a grant to
                    had black southern Sudanese who were adopted by northern Arabic Sudanese as a
                    form of slavery. It was not an adoption in any sense that the Americans
                    recognized it; but it was a problem to work on.</p>
                <pb facs="0216" n="Page0216"/>
                <p>Okay. It would have been fun to have been a millionaire. It would have been fun
                    to have all the money in the world, spend it on anything you wanted to do, but I
                    can't imagine spending 30 years watching the stock market go up and down or
                    trying to figure out the difference between the junk bond and a triple A bond. I
                    couldn't spend 30 years worrying about that, and so I have no second thoughts,
                    no regrets whatsoever about spending time on the issues that I did, working for
                    USAID. When I retired for a couple years after that, yeah I said I enjoyed it;
                    but I wouldn't recommend it to anybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was my last question: given your experience and
                        career, would you recommend to a young man, young woman who has just come
                        out of school to go into this international development business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: Yes. When I first retired my answer would have been no, because I would
                    have seen that as: do you recommend somebody making a career out of USAID. The
                    way you phrase it, make a career in the business of international development,
                    definitely I'd say yes. But, I think what's happened is, there are many more
                    ways to do that now. Where USAID was the only game in town in many senses; there
                    are other organizations in development on the outside. But you know, USAID was
                    the major actor. I don't think USAID will continue to be the major actor in most
                    areas, most functional fields, most countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who will? Who's going to take the lead?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0217" n="Page0217"/>
                <p>JOHNSON: Don't know, don't know. There are a number of NGOs, non governmental
                    organizations in the world. Some of them are operational and they run programs
                    overseas. Some are lobby groups and they just try to have legislation passed
                    that have certain elements. But, as a group they're much more active overseas
                    than they were 30 years ago. They have developed and trained their own staffs to
                    where they do have a professional cadre now that they use; the universities and
                    colleges are looking for ways to be active overseas. They face funding problems.
                    But, the interest and the desire to work on development kinds of problems are
                    very much in the university community. I think the international arena is more
                    substantive than it use to be. For a long time, the World Bank and the IMF both
                    were regarded as the professionals and regarded themselves as the only
                    professionals. You have other international avenues opening up. As a product of
                    my own experience with them, I have a bias against regional organizations and I
                    just tend to think that they do very little and they siphon off trained people
                    that could be used bilaterally. But, I also bite my tongue and say some of those
                    are doing a lot more than I thought they could. Starting from such simple areas
                    as weather prediction, where you have inter-regional weather studies to
                    telecommunications and looking at telecommunications on a broader basis. The
                    World Trade Organization and how it tries to establish the rules of the game.
                    You've got a lot of regional institutions which were becoming more important and
                    are taking more of a role. In some way, I think the World Bank will probably
                    remain the overall senior advisor, if the government wants a senior advisor.
                    They probably won't turn to USAID. They may turn to USAID in certain sectors or
                    on some problem areas. And, part of that is because the U.S. will always have
                    more money than other people have. But the senior across the board development
                    experts at The World Bank will probably wind up with that kind of knowledge.
                    And, for someone interested in economic development across the board, I'd
                    recommend that they try and get a job at the World Bank. If they're interested
                    in international development, then USAID is perfectly a good avenue. But,
                    there's also other avenues, even CARE., if they want to get more involved in the
                    humanitarian and emergency side of things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any last thoughts you want to add at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: I'd recall a Joan Crawford movie where it has her going up the stairs
                    and she turns back and looks at the people in the lobby and says, hang on, it's
                    going to be a hell of a ride. That's sort of the way I feel about the past 30
                    years. It's been extraordinarily interesting, challenging, all the positives you
                    want to say about it. I think the one area that I would really, if I could
                    change something in the USAID, would be the divide between Foreign Service and
                    Civil Service, which I think is a leftover of past organizations, but has
                    resulted in damaging people. I think I am extraordinary lucky as a Civil Servant
                    to wind up with the jobs that I held. I can also say I never felt discriminated
                    against in USAID, because I was a woman. I never felt discriminated against in
                    other sections because of being a young person. I always felt that there was a
                    bias against me because I was Civil Service and that the Foreign Service people
                    said, well what do you know about it, you've never been there. I think that is
                    so strong throughout the Agency.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JOHNSON: It also convinced me that in the Foreign Service, it's different when
                    you're overseas. And, like I said before, overseas, and the Missions, the
                    ultimate career objective is to be a Mission Director and in many ways Mission
                    Directors are gods. And, you come back to Washington and there you are, an
                    ex-god and they don't pay any attention to you. So, overall an A+.</p>
