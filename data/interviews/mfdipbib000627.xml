                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: June 16, 1987</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Over the years of 1955 to 1977, I have indirectly worked
                        for Miss Knight as consular officer at American embassies and consulates
                        abroad, issuing and renewing passports, and looking to her office for
                        general supervision.I wonder if you could describe a bit about your general
                        background, where you were born, where you grew up, and your education
                        before you came to Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Well, I was born in Newport, Rhode Island, where my parents spent the
                    summers, and I enjoyed it there very much, because it's a beautiful state, and
                    it was sort of our home away from home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was your home?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: We lived for many, many years in New York. We only had, I think, as I
                    recall now, two and a half residences in New York, and my parents were very
                    active in many things. My mother was very active in teaching people how to dress
                    and how to sew. She was really quite brilliant about looking a person over and
                    suggesting what would make that person feel important in the way of dress, in
                    the way of taking care of their appearance. She was very good at teaching old
                    people how to dress. As you probably know—I think we all do—that some of the
                    clothes that were available—well, and still are—are not particularly flattering
                    to people. People make mistakes in buying certain types of clothing that don't
                    do them any good. It doesn't do them any harm, but it doesn't help them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It doesn't bring out their best.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Right. So she was good at that sort of thing, and she liked to work with
                    young people. I went through Hunter. To start back, the entry school, the
                    grammar school, the high school, and the college, so I had gone through all that
                    in New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I noticed your biography mentions you went to schools in
                        France, Czechoslovakia, and Monaco.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Yes, yes. But these were short term.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up languages at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Well, my mother was Czechoslovakian. That was my first language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: And my mother and father spoke German most of the time and my mother
                    taught me to speak French, so I actually spoke French and German before I spoke
                    English because of all our traveling, they were really much more accustomed at
                    home to speaking foreign languages, and I picked it up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of business was your father in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: He had what, I guess you would call a tourist bureau. Of course, in those
                    days, there was very little of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know. You had Cook's Travel Office, and that was about
                        it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: That was it. You had Cook's. You either had that or you didn't go. But my
                    father was very good on traveling as he knew so many people. He was an
                    Englishman and very well known in England. He was in the Royal Air Force. That
                    man with the wonderful voice in the early part of the war broadcast that
                    “England expects every man to do his duty” or the like. And that was the day my
                    father went into the Royal Air Force to fight World War I.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess you must have been very proud of him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Hunter College while it was part of Columbia
                        University?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>KNIGHT: Yes but, I never graduated from Hunter; in those days, college,
                    university were like an open book. You would go in and out and in and out. If it
                    was necessary for the family to go to Europe, well, we'd go to Europe instead of
                    taking courses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was an excellent education for your later work with
                        the State Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What brought you to Washington to work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Well, that was back in '34, '35. Of course, if you recall, there was so
                    much in the papers about the Roosevelt Administration, the big changes happening
                    in Washington. And my husband, Wayne Parrish, who was, widely known for his
                    tremendous interest in aviation, and the result of that was that he wanted to
                    come to Washington to make his mark in the aviation business. Q: You were
                    married in New York. What year were you married?</p>
                <p>KNIGHT: That's a horrible request of you, because I never remember. I never have
                    remembered, and my husband said, “Honestly, I don't know how the hell you don't
                    remember your wedding date.” (Laughs)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No problem there. You came to Washington in 1934, so
                        obviously you were married before that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Yes. He was a reporter, and an excellent writer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of work did you initially do when you came to
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Well, when I came to Washington, Wayne followed me to Washington. I
                    decided to come because of the Roosevelt Administration. I was very curious
                    about it. It had a tremendous amount of publicity, because it was very new and
                    different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it was a feeling of activism and change.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: So the first thing I did was to go to the Civil Service Commission and
                    ask whether they had any openings. And they did. I took a battery of aptitude
                    tests, 11 altogether. It's a whole listing that they give you, and you have to
                    check it off as to type of work it would be.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: But you see, that was the Thirties. And under the Roosevelt
                    Administration, there were so many changes, and a lot of jobs opened up, because
                    things became bigger and bigger. I happened to run into some friends from New
                    York who said, “Oh, we know a senator in Washington. Why don't you go to see
                    him?”I said, “Well, I don't know any senators.” I didn't know any congressmen.
                    So this friend, who really was a friend of my mother's, wrote to one of the
                    senators and said, “I have a friend that's coming to Washington. I don't know
                    how long she'll be there, but please be good to her,” and gave me his address. I
                    went up to the Hill, and I visited not only that one person, but several others
                    on the Hill, and I found myself saying, “Well, you know, it's sort of fun to be
                    up here on the Hill and talking to all these very, very important people.” Of
                    course, the longer I stayed in Washington, the less entranced I got. People were
                    nice and fine, but I found that there was an awful lot of muddling in those
                    days. Today I can understand it. That early administration from Franklin D.
                    Roosevelt was a tough one, very, very tough. It was a complete change, and it
                    changed everything in Washington. It was interesting.I got a job, and when I say
                    I got a job, it was a peculiar job, because I just walked into the Commerce
                    Department and ran into a number of the people who had been assigned to make
                    this great change in Washington, based on a deeper understanding of what the
                    public was looking for, what the public had to be educated on. It was a big
                    change in government, and while the Roosevelt Administration did have its weak
                    points, everybody worked hard. There wasn't such a thing as, for instance, going
                    out for a two-hour lunch. There wasn't such a thing as saying, “No, I can't do
                    it because I'm leaving this afternoon at 5:00.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a feeling of urgency and necessity.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: That's right. And it was a good feeling, and it was a feeling that, I
                    think, encouraged people to do things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: People were staying in the Department of Commerce offices until 6:00 and
                    7:00 in the evening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a feeling, I believe, in those days of purpose,
                        and you were feeling you were doing something, rather than
                        time-serving.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving ahead, before you were assigned to the Passport
                        Office, had you had a chance to observe its workings and all? Did you have
                        any feeling for the Passport Office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Not at all, because I was actually more concerned with the Senate and the
                    House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing more or less immediately prior to
                        being assigned to the Passport Office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: I worked for Congressman John Taber from Auburn, New York. He came from
                    New York, and he was Chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, which gave
                    him a lot of clout.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: And he was a close personal friend of the family in New York that my
                    mother and I knew, and there was some telephone calls and conversations and so
                    on. So one day I was told to go to his office and visit with him. He was a very
                    stern person, New England, stern. He worked always. He got into the office early
                    in the morning and he stayed late at night. He was that type of person. That was
                    his job, and he was going to stick with it as long as he could possibly stay
                    there.</p>
                <p>So I talked to him, only just a very short conversation, and he said, “Why don't
                    you come in here and work for me? Look at the piles of paper I've got around
                    here.” He said, “It's not an easy job, but you'll learn a lot.” And that's the
                    way I started. That's the only way I started. I didn't know anyone else. I
                    didn't know the names of the senators or congressmen. Obviously, coming from New
                    York, I wasn't really concerned with any of that.</p>
                <p>But John Taber was known in Washington as having a tremendous voice. The first
                    thing I learned about him was from a young lady in his office who said to me,
                    “Be careful. Don't get him mad or upset about something, because he'll shout at
                    you, and you'll have your eardrums burst.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “What do you mean?” And she said, “He made a speech in the House of
                    Representatives and somebody interrupted him and he got angry, and he shouted.
                    And the man next to him lost his hearing.” Well, very fortunately, it was not
                    permanent. So he was known as a tremendous speaker and he became chairman of a
                    very important committee, and that was the House Appropriations Committee. From
                    there, I went on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why the Passport Office? This was in 1955.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>KNIGHT: Well, you see, I was in different other jobs in the meantime. For
                    instance, I was called by the White House. I was still working in the Civil
                    Service. Whatever happened to come up, sometimes the Civil Service Commission
                    would call me and say, “Could you come down and spend so much time at such and
                    such a project?”</p>
                <p>Remember, that was in the early days of the Roosevelt Administration, and
                    everybody was trying hard to do something that was worthwhile, and most of it
                    was difficult, because there was so little preparation prior to the Roosevelt
                    Administration. Apparently, Roosevelt came in there and the place was a mess.
                    Washington was a mess. There were so many things that were done that were either
                    done badly or not at all.</p>
                <p>So I stayed on, and little by little learned about government, and I thought,
                    “Well, everything I've learned, everything I've been told is true: it's a mess.”
                    I wasn't very happy about having come to Washington and getting into the
                    government, until I met what they called the New Dealers. They were the people
                    who started in a completely new environment in Washington, with President
                    Roosevelt , who was very, very active.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: One day the President wanted someone who could contact Mrs. Roosevelt for
                    him when she was giving exercise classes. She was exercising the personnel of a
                    certain office that was in the triangular building at Dupont Circle. Mrs.
                    Roosevelt had an office there, and as she got to know the girls and women who
                    were working in that building, and she said, “I think it's outrageous that they
                    work all day long, have their lunch at their desks. I want them to have exercise
                    on the roof.” So Mrs. Roosevelt set up an exercise committee, and she herself
                    took part in it.</p>
                <p>The President said to one of his aides, “I've got to get somebody to go up and
                    get in touch with my wife and work out something to keep her away from
                    exercising on the roof of that building.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On Massachusetts and Dupont Circle, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: It's still there. She had this thing going up, and sure enough, the
                    President was right. The press got into it. I was called to the White House, who
                    said, “You've got to get the press out of there. They must not talk to Mrs.
                    Roosevelt, they must not see her running around the roof doing these exercises
                    with the staff. And the President is very concerned about it. The President's
                    wife shouldn't be doing this sort of thing. What are you doing?”</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>I said, “I'm not doing anything. I'm working here. I don't have any assignment
                    with Mrs. Roosevelt. I haven't talked to Mrs. Roosevelt. I don't even know what
                    office she's in.”</p>
                <p>With Mrs. Roosevelt, it wasn't a question of what office; she was all over the
                    place. She'd stop into an office, she'd talk to the girls, go downstairs, she'd
                    go upstairs, she was on the roof. And the President just got to the point where
                    he was scared to death that it would become a joke, the President's wife doing
                    all this monkey business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: So then I was again called. This was another call from the White House.
                    “Get rid of the press. Don't have the press go up with Mrs. Roosevelt to do
                    these calisthenics.”</p>
                <p>And I remember the first girl that came in was AP [Associated Press], and I said,
                    “I can't help you. I simply can't help you. I can't tell you where she is. I
                    don't know anything about it.” Well, that was the AP, and they were upset, and
                    they stuck around and stuck around, and I called the White House and said,
                    “There's nothing I can do. The press comes in. You can't lock the doors and
                    simply say that they can't talk to the President's wife if she wants to talk to
                    the press.”</p>
                <p>Well, to make a long story short, we got through with that particular thing, but
                    it was difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving somewhat ahead now, you went to the Passport Office
                        in 1955. Had you asked for that position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: No, no, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Passport Office had been run, if I recall, for 27
                        years by Ruth Shipley, who was sort of a power unto herself in
                        Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: She retired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She retired. Why were you brought in for that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: She wanted me to come. She recommended me to take her place when she
                    retired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you worked in the Passport Office at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>KNIGHT: No, except that I knew her like everybody else because she had been there
                    a long time, but she was not very popular, not only with the staff, but with the
                    people who were asking for passports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My understanding was that the Passport Office was not in a
                        very organized state at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: No, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find it when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: It was a mess. It was an absolute mess, because in the first place, I
                    don't think Mrs. Shipley believed in excessive travel, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was the wrong person for that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: That's right. She had no interest in travel herself. She personally did
                    very little traveling, as far as I know, because I never remember her
                    [traveling]. She took a liking to me (Laughs) and I think I was very fortunate
                    that she liked me, because there were very, very few people that Mrs. Shipley
                    did like. She could not stand her constituency. If a person lost a passport, or
                    if a passport was stolen, she said, “Well, that's not my fault; it's their
                    fault. Let them worry about it.” She never tried and I remember she said, “It's
                    not my business to take care of the people in the United States who want to go
                    abroad and lose their passports or lose their papers. The Americans don't know
                    how to travel anyway. They have no business going out of the country.” That was
                    her idea. She would say, “What do you want to go to Europe for? Isn't this
                    country good enough for you?” And the other thing is, if a person asked too many
                    questions or if they were trying to get some information from the Passport
                    Office, it would annoy her, she would say, “Well, we're not here to give you
                    information on where you should go in Europe. Go to a travel agency.” In a way,
                    she was correct, but she, in a way, brought this on herself.</p>
                <p>The Congress was—and is today—always looking for something to do for a
                    constituent which might be useful or helpful to the congressman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Make the constituent indebted to the congressman.
                        Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: And this is something Mrs. Shipley never did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it that she didn't understand it or didn't care?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>KNIGHT: She said, “It's not my business. If they want to do something for their
                    constituent, let them do it. I'm not going to do it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why wasn't something done about this? Why did this sort of
                        attitude exist in a key position, I mean, somebody with that type of
                        attitude remain there so long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: That's just what I was going to say. She was there a long time, she knew
                    more about the State Department than most of the people in the State Department,
                    including the Secretary of State. (Laughs) She never really considered herself
                    as an employee. Everything was done well and correctly, but I never found her to
                    consider herself as one of the staff doing anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was her office.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: It was her office, period, and you did it the way she wanted it done, you
                    see. If you lost your passport, it was stupid. That was one of the things I
                    remember so well. People lose their passports, of course, they're careless, and
                    there is a certain amount of stupidity, but what do you do about it? You change
                    it, you see. But she wouldn't. She said, “If they lost the passport, that's
                    their business; that's not mine.”Q: How did the staff feel about her in the
                    Passport Office?</p>
                <p>KNIGHT: She wasn't liked by the staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: She was never really very friendly with the staff, and she disliked
                    blacks. She disliked the blacks very much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did she come from the South or from Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Yes, I think so. There was enough of the South to keep this in her mind,
                    and it's too bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was a good proportion of the people working in the
                        Passport Office black at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>KNIGHT: No. There were some and they were not trained properly. When I came in, I
                    had a real problem. I stopped the drinking. I mean, I went down one day, within
                    the first week or ten days, and found that in the basement, right after lunch,
                    they had bottles of whiskey there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the old Winder Building, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Yes. They were having a ball. Mrs. Shipley was of another generation.
                    During her stay in the Passport Office, she ran it—period. She did it her way,
                    and she resented anyone coming into it or getting into it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had, by this time, developed a reputation for being a
                        good administrator. Why would she pick you rather than some . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: She didn't pick me. It was the Secretary of State that picked me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying that she had recommended you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Well, there's something about Mrs. Shipley. She knew when to stop
                    something, and when she found out that the Secretary of State called me into his
                    office and said, “We've got to do something about this situation.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Foster Dulles?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: It was Foster Dulles. He was concerned about Mrs. Shipley, because she
                    was having problems with Congress. That was the reason they were changing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was not responsive to Congress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: She was not responsive to Congress; she didn't like the Congress; she was
                    not interested in helping them with their constituencies. She would say, for
                    instance, “Well, Congressman So-and-so has a problem. He's got a stupid person
                    in his place, and he's trying to tell us to do such and such a thing to take
                    care of that person's passport. I won't do it.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were really brought in by Secretary Dulles to clean
                        up the mess as he saw it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>KNIGHT: Absolutely. The members of Congress were getting to the point where they
                    were actually telling him, “You've got to do something about that Passport
                    Office. It simply is not working well. We have a constituent, a very important
                    person, that put so and so into the Senate or into the House and so on, and this
                    woman is saying that she won't send them a passport for three weeks. The man
                    wants to leave next week; she says, 'No, I'm not going to send it to you. I'm
                    too busy.'” So you see, she had a very strong will, she had a very strong will.
                    Now she was good to me, but people did not like her. She was too stern. She had
                    a stern background. Her son told me this, that she was very stern with
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of things did you set about to do when you took
                        over the Passport Office? What were some of your priorities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Well, the first thing was to get the employees to work together.
                    Secondly, to stop the drinking in the basement. And they never knew when I would
                    come down, but I was down three and four times a day, just passing by, saying,
                    “What are you boys doing? What are all these whiskey bottles over here?” Now she
                    never went down in the basement; she wouldn't dream of going down into the
                    basement to see what was going on. I found whiskey bottles in the toilets in the
                    building. Actually, people in the Passport Office were bringing in drinks. I
                    certainly know of at least one man who had a bottle of whiskey with him every
                    day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were people from a variety of ranks, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't just some of the messengers and the like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Oh, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was sort of endemic throughout. What about the system
                        they had, the filing system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Terrible. Terrible. And, of course, it took six weeks or more to get a
                    passport. The first thing that I did was to say , “A passport request from any
                    place in the United States by an American citizen requires and that we have a
                    record of it, and the passport will be issued within a matter of three

                <p>KNIGHT: And we did that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much opposition from your staff to begin
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: No, none, because they didn't like Mrs. Shipley, you see.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had a group going with you rather than against
                        you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: That's right. I had a group that became very useful, and they are there
                    today. I've got two lawyers out of that group. After a while, it worked out
                    quite well, because the staff was actually good. She had a good staff. She
                    wasn't friendly with them. She never, never said to them, “You did a good job,”
                    or “You didn't do a good job. This is the way it should have been done.” They
                    did not like her. They considered her too stern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So when you came in, you didn't bring a core of other
                        people to take over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was just you working with the staff that was
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Yes. Then, of course, I had the help at the time—of those who were in
                    charge of the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it Scott McCleod?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Scott, yes. I never could figure out what Scott McCleod did until he
                    left. (Laughs) Until he left for Europe, and he bought himself—I think he hired
                    the horses, but anyway, he found himself a place where he bought some silver
                    harnessing for the horses, and he never got over there. (Laughs) He never got
                    over there. Scott enjoyed traveling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. He was the Director of the Bureau of Security and
                        Consular Affairs and went to become Ambassador to Ireland.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: That's right. He was a good guy. He was a good guy. He really didn't work
                    very hard, but he was . . .</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But he had quite a reputation as being Senator McCarthy's
                        hatchet man.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: I know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this deserved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: No. No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He didn't leave much impression on the State Department, I
                        remember.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: No. He was one of these go-betweens. He knew a lot of people on the Hill;
                    that helped him some. I really don't know. I think he was most happy when he was
                    overseas, when he got the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Ireland, yes. One of the anomalies of the State
                        Department has always been the Passport Office, especially under Ruth
                        Shipley and your term, which really comes to almost 49 years, when you put
                        the two together, that it is in the State Department, yet it's not. Even at
                        the very beginning, did you feel that anybody was supervising you, or were
                        you more or less told to go it alone, and as long as you produced, everybody
                        was happy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: You see, having worked for John Taber and Congressman Wigglesworth,
                    another good, staunch friend of mine, and John Taber, and I knew a number of
                    others. I had a great deal of help from the Hill. Without even thinking of it in
                    that way, I saw to it that I had a section made in the Passport Office so that
                    if a member of Congress or someone at the White House or an important person had
                    a problem with a passport, we were there to take care of it immediately, within
                    a matter of hours or a day or two. What we came up with was that members of
                    Congress who had constituents who would call them up and say, “I had a death in
                    my family, I'm leaving tomorrow, I need a passport, I'm going to London, I'm
                    going to Paris, a family member died,” and these Congressmen would say, “My God!
                    How can we help? Whom do we go to?”And when this came to my attention, I said,
                    “Let us do that for you. Let us do that for the Congress,” which is what we did.
                    We set up a system that in an emergency any member of Congress, whether in the
                    House or Senate, could immediately call us, give us the name of the person, the
                    address, we would check it out, and if at all possible, we will see to it that
                    within a matter of 24 hours, they would get a passport, even if it was a
                    temporary passport, to allow them to go. In the case of a death, we would give
                    them a temporary passport. We would have a number on it, and make a copy of it.
                    This is the way we started, so that in the final analysis, the greatest help I
                    ever had was from members of Congress. They still call me for one thing or
                    another. Sometimes it has nothing to do with passports!</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a serving passport officer abroad, I know we all felt
                        the same urgency that you had, that if there was a problem, sometimes your
                        office would call and say, “So and so is on a plane, and we didn't have a
                        chance to give them a passport.” So when I was a passport officer in
                        Frankfurt, we would call the Frankfurt Customs and say, “Look, so and so is
                        coming on a plane without a passport. We guarantee everything—we'll give
                        them a passport here.” It worked very well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: And they never forgot it. At least the person that got that service never
                    forgot it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no. This is the way government should work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any special sort of recruitment program for
                        getting new people in to your staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: No, as a matter of fact, I kept almost everybody. I got two
                    lawyers—they're still there. They keep calling me. The staff became very proud
                    of the office, because we had good newspaper coverage, number one. This was
                    during the period of time when a lot of reporters were going back and forth to
                    Europe and they always came to the Passport Office to get their passports
                    immediately, within not a matter of an hour, but immediately they had to get a
                    passport. So we got good help from the newspapers, the New York Times,
                    Washington Post, etc. We also had a great deal of support from the Congress,
                    because I kept an eye on the Congress. Any congressman or senator that called
                    the Passport Office talked to me immediately, no matter what was going on. He
                    was supposed to have the right to talk to me and say what he needed, when he
                    needed it. I guess I was the only one in the federal government that would say
                    to members of Congress, “Do you have a messenger service? I don't have a
                    messenger service. If you need the thing today, please send somebody over with
                    it, and I'll have it ready for you.” This is the way we operated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The passport business, of course, at that time was
                        expanding geometrically, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you arrange having offices in other parts of the

                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: I established offices in New York, Chicago, and Los Angeles.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were talking about your establishing some branch
                        offices. That had not been done before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Everybody had to mail their application to the Passport
                        Office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That itself must have taken quite a bit of time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Well, you see, Mrs. Shipley would not have done that, scouting around the
                    place, whereas I set up passport agencies in New York, in Chicago, in Los
                    Angeles, and Denver. All those states were absolutely delighted to have a part
                    of the Passport Office there. I also arranged with the telephone companies for
                    them to have the same numbers. It was an easy way for people to call and say,
                    “I'm going to England tomorrow. I need a passport, I need this, I need that.”
                    And it also saved us an awful lot of work. These offices around those particular
                    states didn't cost us anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Well, the State Department claimed it didn't have any money and the
                    states were delighted to think that they had something similar to the Passport
                    Office watching out for their people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who paid for the offices?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: I don't know. I didn't ask. (Laughs) It was none of my business, and I
                    just didn't ask.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (Laughs) You know, I was told by one of your admirers just
                        yesterday, a retired Foreign Service officer, who said, “Please have Miss
                        Knight tell about how you avoided losing your passport agency moved, which
                        was in Rockefeller Center.” They were going to move it away somewhere, and I
                        was told this is a classic example bureaucratic in-fighting. What
                        happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Miss. Knight: Well, in the first place, I called Nelson Rockefeller. Nobody else
                    ever called him, I don't think. He pulled people. But Nelson Rockefeller was in
                    Washington at the time, he was in the House, and I found out about it, so I made
                    an appointment, and sat down to talk to him. There's his picture over there. Of
                    course, he knew an awful lot of people in Washington, and he was well known. I
                    told him about the situation, and that the State Department would not set up an
                    office in the Rockefeller Center. They wouldn't buy an office. I suggested that
                    New York was an important city, and we could do a great job if we could get a
                    passport office in the Rockefeller Center. Of course, the State Department said,
                    “That's crazy. You can't do a thing like that.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Well, I think you can, because, first of all, it would be good;
                    secondly, let me see what I can do with the mayor, talk to the mayor about it,
                    and do it for free. I don't think we should pay for an office there. I think
                    we're doing something for New York City.”</p>
                <p>So it worked out great. I went to New York and went over to Sixth Avenue to the
                    bank, and I said, “I'm from the Passport Office, and we want to move. How about
                    a passport agency in this area in Rockefeller Center? If I can get permission to
                    establish such a place here in the building, I'm going to need some chairs and
                    need stuff, and I can't get them from the State Department, because that means
                    moving them from Washington, D.C., to New York. Apparently that is a tremendous
                    move for the Washington people.”</p>
                <p>So then I went to two other places on Sixth Avenue. I went to the bank. The bank
                    gave me high chairs for free, so that people could, instead of standing in line,
                    sit in the chairs, along the counter and fill out the forms, and turn them over.
                    So it all worked out fine. People said it would never work, that we would never
                    get it done; well, we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did Nelson Rockefeller do for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: He gave us free rent. We had free everything—free rent, an office,
                    telephone, and everything else, which he paid for. I didn't have to ask the
                    government to do it. I wouldn't have gotten it anyway. If I had asked the State
                    Department, they never would have paid for all this, but Nelson Rockefeller did.
                    I got to know him pretty well, as a matter of fact. He would call every so often
                    to see whether the Rockefeller Center was giving us good service, and I'd say,
                    “Are you kidding? Of course they are.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At one point later on, I think this was in the early
                        Seventies, they brought the post offices in. How did this work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: I was against it. I was absolutely against it.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem? This was the idea of bringing post
                        offices in, each post office would act as basically a little passport

                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: It was a mistake. It was a mistake. I think it passed along in a small
                    post office, in a small town, but a place like New York or Philadelphia. It was
                    somebody's idea. I don't know who in the State Department got that idea.. No,
                    but it didn't work out.</p>

                        limited. Before they were unlimited. I held an unlimited diplomatic
                        passport, but I was always nervous about it, because many people didn't turn
                        them in, there were too many, and also they were given to members of
                        Congress and to distinguished people, and there were a lot floating around.
                        Did you have much of a battle to get those limited?</hi>

                <p>KNIGHT: I was absolutely against it, and as of today, somebody in the State
                    Department has gone ahead and said, “Give everybody two passports.”~ Everybody
                    gets two passports, two exact passports.</p>
                <p>And I said, “The guy's either drunk or he's crazy.” You give somebody two of
                    anything like that, and they're going to lose one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, or sell them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Sure. Now, the American passport runs from $500 to maybe $1,000 in Italy.
                    There's an outfit there, a tobacco shop in Rome, and they'll pay that much for
                    an American passport, regardless of who brings it in. They never know anything
                    about anybody, and they have never discussed it, nothing. They sell American
                    passports for between $500 to $1,000, depending on who the person is.</p>
                <p>Now I was told about the two passports recently. The State Department is always
                    so worried about not being loved, you know. If there's a mistake or something
                    like that, they're all upset over it, because the State Department never makes a
                    mistake, they never do this wrong, they never do that wrong. The result is that
                    at the present time, some character in the State Department wants people to get
                    two passports. So I let it be known that if they do that, there will always be
                    one passport missing somewhere around. It's crazy. If a person can't take care
                    of a passport, maybe he shouldn't be allowed to travel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're sounding like Ruth Shipley now. (Laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>KNIGHT: That's right. You know, if a person doesn't know what to do with a
                    passport and loses a passport and it's lost and lost and lost, there's something
                    wrong with a person like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know what you say. Turning to the more political side of
                        passport work, you came to the Passport Office at a time that was still
                        quite a bit of political tension between the two political parties—the
                        Democrats were out, and had not been out too long. You came in in 1955, and
                        the Republicans came into office attacking, I was told, using the motto of
                        “communism, corruption, and conspiracy,” which is a phrase I heard someone
                        say was accredited to you. (Laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: (Laughs) Could be! Could be!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get involved in what amounted to somewhat
                        partisan politics at the time, coming from the Republican Party?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Yes, but I got to know most of the congressmen and senators on the Hill,
                    because when their constituents needed a passport, they wanted to get the credit
                    of having called the Passport Office and saying, “We want a passport issued
                    within 2:00 tomorrow afternoon,” you see. Now that makes the guy look pretty
                    smart, you see. He can pick up the phone and call his constituents and say,
                    “I've taken care of the whole thing.” And I always said, “Go ahead. That's
                    fine.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But we're talking about the great debate that went on for
                        ten or more years over—it was used under the generic term of the right to
                        travel, but these were basically people who were members of the Communist
                        Party or affiliated with the Communist Party. You became more or less on one
                        side of this controversy rather strongly, as opposed to those who wanted
                        more right to travel. Coming from sort of a bureaucratic position, how did
                        you get into this particular controversy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Well, actually, bureaucratic is the right term. This was a position which
                    was taken by the administration. Actually, the whole thing sort of died. It
                    passed away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today I find—I went through the old files. I wonder what
                        the problem was. I mean, it really didn't make a lot of difference who
                        traveled one way or the other in the long run, but people got very partisan
                        on this whole issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>KNIGHT: There wasn't a government—well, if you think back, who made the decisions
                    in that time? The State Department had very little use for the Passport Office.
                    The State Department was busy with a lot of other things, you see, and the
                    Passport Office never really got a tremendous amount of background or
                    backing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to say this as a consular officer, this is true for
                        consular work, which included passport and visa work. As a general rule, the
                        State Department, those who ran the State Department would prefer to be out
                        of the whole consular business entirely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: That's right. That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in reading the old files, the old newspaper files, one
                        gets the feeling that you were representing a much harder line policy
                        regarding the travel of people of left-wing views than did many people,
                        certainly in the media world, but also even within the administration, but
                        at the same time, you were following administration policy at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Yes. I don't recall having any problem with what you just said. Of
                    course, the Passport Office is not in a position and never has been in a
                    position of saying, “No, you can't travel.” I mean, it isn't up to the Passport
                    Office; that is up to the Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or Congress passing a bill.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Or Congress. It's not the Passport Office, because the Passport Office is
                    a working office, issuing passports to American citizens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your relations with the FBI, as far as
                        controlling who traveled and who didn't travel at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Well, I knew J. Edgar Hoover well, and because of my previous work in
                    John Taber's office and William Wigglesworth, the fact that I knew many, many
                    other members of Congress, both the House and the Senate, I never had any real
                    problem with them. As I say, I made it absolutely a most important thing that
                    members of Congress were served right away, and I had within the Passport
                    Office, a section. This woman is still in Washington, a very, very clever,
                    smart, hard worker, who took care, under my general direction, of any member of
                    Congress, regardless of where he was, if he had a constituent that needed a
                    passport, we got it for him, because it was the congressman that got the credit
                    for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I understand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: And the result was that we had the Congress going with us, regardless of
                    what happened. I don't think anybody could have killed the Passport Office in
                    those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know one of the things that there was articles in the
                        paper about, a time-honored custom in the State Department that you seemed
                        to have received the heat from this, and that was on the lookout list. As I
                        recall, the Passport Office used to send out, say, “Be on the lookout for so
                        and so.” Sometimes these were political people that probably the FBI was
                        concerned about, just to say, “If anything comes to your attention, please
                        let us know.” But also these would be for criminal types or confidence
                        types, or deadbeats. I mean, it was really, “If these people come to your
                        attention and need services, please let us know.” But do you recall the
                        circumstances—there was a man, and I looked it up, his name was H. Stewart
                        Hughes. There was a lookout notice for him. He was a Harvard professor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Stewart Hughes?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was 1966. I think it was just one of—it's just a
                        name, but maybe you recall the incident. He was a person considered of
                        left-wing political views, and a notice went out, and it came to the
                        attention of Congress, particularly Senator Kennedy, as Hughes was from
                        Harvard. There was quite a fuss made of this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Yes, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this type of lookout notice get started, do you
                        know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Well, I don't know. Since it was a passport situation, it probably would
                    have gone into the Passport Office as to what was the reason for whatever
                    happened. I mean, if Stewart Hughes was not given a passport, there must have
                    been some reason.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he was given a passport, but it was the lookout
                        notice. He was just one of some others, I think. That was just a name that I
                        happened to notice.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>KNIGHT: The lookout notice, there again, this was something that the Passport
                    Office did, but it was a lookout to find out what—it had nothing to do with
                    interrogation or why was he going to such and such a place, why was he taking a
                    trip. That was none of our business. We couldn't care less what he was doing.
                    The thing is, if the FBI or any other agency in government had information that
                    that person had some contacts in, say, the Soviet Union, well, it was up to that
                    person to get it through to the State Department. It wasn't the Passport Office
                    that was involved. The Passport Office is pretty far down the line, really. It's
                    a convenience to the public, that's all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your relations with the various Secretaries of
                        State, such as Dulles, Rusk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Dulles was a good friend of mine. Well, he was the one who really hired
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He hired you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Yes, yes. I remember he called me to his office, and he said that I had
                    been recommended by members of Congress to him, and that Mrs. Shipley was
                    retiring, and that it had been suggested to him that I was a proper person for
                    that job, because I had been working in the government over the years. So I
                    think that from that standpoint, it was all right. I remember so well that
                    Dulles said to me—when I was in the waiting room outside his office, it was just
                    a small one, half the size of this, a lot of chairs, I was sitting like this
                    towards the door, and I was watching the door, and the door moved just a little
                    bit, and a little bit more. I thought I saw a person's eye. Sure enough, it was
                    Dulles. Dulles was opening the door just a little bit to find out what I looked
                    like, you know, and he had already known that I was there. So then he made an
                    effort to open the door, as though he had not been looking through the door. I
                    remember that very well.</p>
                <p>He invited me into his office, and he said, “Well, I just want to discuss with
                    you the fact that you have been recommended by members of Congress and by the
                    Secretary for the Passport Office. Mrs. Shipley is leaving, she's retiring, and
                    you've got a reputation of being very tough with people.”</p>
                <p>And I looked at him, and I said, “Well, what about you? You're tough with people.
                    I know about all your toughness.” (Laughs) And we started talking, and that was
                    it. Out of that small, insignificant conversation, he said, “When can you
                    start?” That was it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any more dealings with him?</hi>

                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>KNIGHT: (Laughs) No! (Laughs) The thing just evaporated, and the next thing that
                    happened, I was in that office. Well, I can understand why some people thought I
                    was a little strange. I telephoned to a couple of congressmen and senators, and
                    said, “One of these days, in the next week or so, why don't you stop by the
                    Passport Office? I want to show you something.” And three of them came in,
                    including John Taber. John Taber was a large man, he was heavy, and I took them
                    into the basement of the Passport Office, which was . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Winder Building.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Right. And a very old building. John Taber, because I had been working
                    for him, I called him, he said, “I'll be right over. I'll be right over.” He
                    must have taken a cab and came over. I said, “I want you to look at something in
                    the basement, and that's where we keep all our records. There's an underground
                    path from the Passport Office into what was then called the War Department.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's now called the Executive Office Building, the Grant
                        Building?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Yes. There's an underground passage. And that was wired. I took John
                    Taber over there. He was a heavy guy, and he walked to the opening of that
                    thing, and the floor broke, and his foot went through. His whole foot went
                    through the floor. He wasn't hurt, but it was very useful to me, and I said to
                    him, “You see this building is in such bad shape, that anybody coming down here
                    could hurt themselves, could break an ankle. I have to come down here every day.
                    Now listen. The place is full of not squirrels, but rats. The State Department
                    won't do a thing about it.”</p>
                <p>“Well,” he said, “find out about that. It's a State Department building, isn't
                    it?</p>
                <p>I said, “It's a Passport Office building under the State Department. Yes, I would
                    say that it's part of the State Department.”</p>
                <p>He said, “All right.” He then decided to go through the whole office. I showed
                    him some things. I showed him an open cesspool that was in the back of the
                    building. The stink was awful. Couldn't get anybody in the State Department to
                    do anything. He made a note of it.</p>
                <p>So in due course, he had Wigglesworth, himself, and their wives come to this
                    Passport Office, and I took them through that basement—rats, bugs, everything. I
                    said, “It's absolutely incredible the State Department won't do anything to this
                    building. They want to tear it down, and I don't think it should be torn down,
                    because they had prisoners go through this underground.” See, this goes under
                    the street.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, under 17th Street, I think it is.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Under the street. I said, “You know, the prisoners were taken under the
                    street from the other building, which was the War Department building, and they
                    had an inquisition there on these people.” So Taber brought his wife. I didn't
                    say anything to them, but the wives were down there, and, of course, they saw
                    the rats and screamed because they were scared to death of the rats. I said,
                    “The rats aren't going to do anything to you.”</p>
                <p>So little by little, we got the thing done. But the State Department didn't raise
                    a finger to clean that place up, that building, the old Winder Building. It was
                    absolutely terrible. The elevators were bad. Oh, it was just awful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any relation, outside of being left alone
                        by—well, Christian Herter was only in a short time, but Dean Rusk and then
                        Rogers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Rogers was the worst.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was he the worst?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: He was the worst. He had no interest in the Passport Office. As a matter
                    of fact, I think he considered it a nuisance. He didn't want it in part of the
                    State Department, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Yes, I went to see him several times, and I found him to be rude.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that you two New Yorkers could have
                        talked to each other.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: No, I thought he was rude. And then again, we were talking about staffing
                    and one thing and another, and I remember he said to me, “Well, you've got a big
                    staff in the Passport Office, and maybe sometimes it's too big, isn't it?”</p>
                <p>And I said, “No, I think you're talking about your own staff. We don't have a big
                    staff. We have a staff that's necessary to serve the public when they need
                    passports, and that's about all, and to be sure that the passport is taken care
                    of and not sold.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Well, that's ridiculous. What do you mean about selling a
                    passport?”</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>I said, “Because an American passport can be sold from anywhere from $500 to
                    $1,000 in Rome. It's a simple thing. Everybody knows that. You can sell your
                    passport.” As a matter of fact, we have the record of one family where the two
                    daughters went to Italy, to Rome, and they sold their passports. They told us
                    that they had lost the passport or that the passport was stolen. By checking
                    with certain people, I think the British, we found out that they didn't them;
                    they sold them.</p>
                <p>So I told that to Rogers, and Rogers said, “Well, I don't see that that's any of
                    your business.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “I think it is my business if I'm running the Passport Office. I
                    don't want American passports sold around Europe.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Well, maybe you're taking too rough a size on this thing.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “No, I don't think so. I think it's very important to be sure that
                    the United States passport is authentic, that it's not sold, that it's not lost.
                    It's an important document, and I think we ought to keep it that way.”</p>
                <p>He was a very peculiar guy. I did say one thing that I think burned him up. I
                    needed additional personnel, two lawyers, actually, that are still there. I
                    finally got them, but he didn't do anything to help. I remember that bringing
                    this in, and I said, “Well, when you consider the amount of work that we have
                    coming into that office from 9:00 in the morning until closing, and how many of
                    us work overtime to keep that passport operation going full, full shift, we work
                    and work and work, and we try to get people to understand how to take care of
                    the passports, not to loan them to somebody else. We just found a case where a
                    woman loaned her passport to somebody else because she said the woman didn't
                    have a passport, a friend of hers, so she said, 'Take my passport.'” So, you
                    know, he had a very, very little knowledge of what was going on. He just didn't
                    know and he didn't support us. I said, “I do need some additional
                    personnel.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, you have a lot.”</p>
                <p>I said, “I do not have a lot. I have a very small office. Actually, we work
                    overtime, we work Saturdays. If you will excuse the expression, you have a very
                    high personnel, and they're not always very busy.” And I think he resented that.
                    (Laughs) But it was true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know that there is no secret about the lack of respect,

                <p>KNIGHT: Oh, he was terrible. He was dumb. Too much monkey business.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: He was looking for a job. He just wanted a job. He wanted to be
                    recognized. Nobody liked him. I don't know what was the matter with him. Nobody
                    knew what he was aiming for, what was he doing in the government?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My only knowledge of Abba Schwartz was that I came back, I
                        was the chief of the consular section in Yugoslavia, Belgrade, and I came
                        back to make a call on him, and I was told he didn't see consular officers.
                        Since we were the people who did his work for him, I'll never forget
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: No, he was a very peculiar guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it seemed as though you two were in a real head-on
                        confrontation when he was trying to get you kicked upstairs and out of the
                        Passport Office. And what happened was he eventually was reorganized out of
                        his job. Were you involved in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: He was no good. He had nothing to go on. I don't know whether he was a
                    friend of somebody's who put him in the job. I don't know who put him in the
                    job, but he was a nothing. You see, having been in the government since 1933,
                    '34, I don't think that the government should sit back and take care of people
                    just because they happen to have a congressman or a senator who needs the money,
                    because that's what happens. [Telephone interruption]</p>

                <p>KNIGHT: Yes, yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I sort of think it was Robert Kennedy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: That's right. That's right. But he was, of course, greatly disliked by
                    the staff, the lawyers, for instance. They had no use for him. He just wanted to
                    run the whole place, and, of course, he didn't know anything about it. He didn't
                    know anything about passports—he knew some people in the Congress. I don't know
                    whom he knew in the Congress. He may have known Kennedy. I don't know. He got a
                    big push from somebody, but the Passport Office people just hated him,
                    absolutely hated him, and he was very rude to most people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had so many people heading that Bureau of Security and
                        Consular Affairs. You mentioned in one newspaper account, that it was like a
                        railroad station.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Yes, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In ten years there had been ten occupants or something. I
                        have to say that this was the bureau out of which I worked, but I was
                        overseas. I can't even remember their names. The one, however, who made
                        quite a strong impression was Barbara Watson, who I think did a great deal
                        of good for the consular corps as such, I think gave them new clout and
                        respect and all that. But again . . .</hi>

                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: She wanted to meddle into everything, you see, and she didn't know enough
                    about the Passport Office. I don't know whether she had any support from of

                <p>KNIGHT: For some reason or other, she resented the Passport Office, and she
                    resented these two lawyers that are still there. I picked them out. They're very
                    good, and they're not afraid to say what is necessary to be said to people. Of
                    course, they resented her, because she meddled. I think she had a law
                    degree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, she had a law degree.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Well, she used that on these two lawyers that did all the passport
                    operations. I mean, would attempt legal work. She resented them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of issues would she meddle in on passports?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: Oh, she meddled in virtually everything. For instance, she resented very,
                    very much that I knew so many members of Congress. At one point, she ordered me
                    not to have any contacts with the Congress. I said, “That's ridiculous. In the
                    Passport Office, these guys make their living out of the Passport Office to some
                    extent. A constituent calls a congressman or a senator, and they want a passport
                    right away quick. They call us, and we give it to them within 24 hours. What
                    else do you need? It's very simple.” Well, she never understood that—never. She
                    became very, very nasty to the two lawyers. You see, they're still there.
                    They're good lawyers, and I don't like lawyers, generally speaking. I mean, I
                    don't like them, I don't trust them, but then I don't trust doctors. She was
                    pretty close to Abba Schwartz, too.</p>

                    looked in through the window, and I happened to see him. I thought, “What the
                    hell is he doing looking through the window?” where we had lines of persons, you
                    see, waiting for passports. And they were all in line at the four windows. We
                    had four windows and four girls handling passport issuances. I opened up the
                    door, and I said, “What are you doing looking through the window? Why don't you
                    come in?” (Laughs) Yes, he was all right. Very few people ever came from the
                    State Department to the Passport Office. We were always stuck on K Street.</p>

                    the support. It didn't get the support. A great many people in the State
                    Department resented the Passport Office, because the Passport Office got a lot
                    of publicity, you see. But I don't think it was supported by the State
                    Department. They thought we were getting too much publicity, and I think maybe
                    the Secretary was too kind to us or something. I just think that had something
                    to do with it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: No, no. Well, as a matter of fact, the Passport Office is giving me a big
                    to-do next month.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How wonderful!</hi>

                <p>KNIGHT: Yes. Every year they do it, the whole staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You certainly left your mark on the Passport Office for
                        the good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: It's been very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You instilled a sense of service, which I don't think had
                        been there certainly before or, really, in many government agencies. It's
                        remarkable.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KNIGHT: No, the Passport Office, first of all, got publicity, it made the staff
                    feel good that they were recognized. I had important people coming in to see
                    them, and I would take them through the shop and show them what we had, you see.
                    That was all very important to them. They were recognized, you see. They did
                    their work well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We might close right there. This has been very interesting
                        to me. As I say, I'm an old passport hand myself.</hi>
