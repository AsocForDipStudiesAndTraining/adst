                <p>Copyright 2008 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When and where were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: I was born on September 17, 1943 right outside of Philadelphia, the
                    Philadelphia suburbs, where I grew up and lived. My parents were immigrants,
                    came from Italy, both of them from the same region. They came when they were
                    young. My grandparents and mother's family settled in South Philadelphia; my
                    father's family in a small suburb outside of Philadelphia and that's where I
                    spent my youth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know much about your grandparents on both sides;
                        where they came from and what they were engaged in and why they came
                        over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Yes. On my mother's side, my grandfather was a tailor and he's from the
                    Abruzzi region of Italy and came at the turn of the last century, established
                    himself and then sent for the rest of the family, which was the typical way
                    things were done. About five or six years after he got here, the grandmothers
                    came with all the brood. My father's side of the family almost the same thing,
                    also from the Abruzzi region. They were basically farmers and my grandfather
                    came and established himself here, got a job, sent for the grandmother and the
                    kids and that's how my parents came. My father was 14 when he came, my mother
                    was three. They obviously met here, both from the same region of Italy and
                    again, met here and I grew up in a really big, extended Italian family.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your father continue in the tailoring business?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>ZINNI: No. My grandfather on my mother's side was the tailor. My mother was in
                    the garment industry. I mean, she made handmade buttonholes for Jacob Reeds. My
                    father not long after he was here was drafted into the army, went back with the
                    American expeditionary force in World War I, and was in an aviation unit
                    actually in France. Then he began doing work in factories and mills that sort of
                    dotted the river leading out of Philadelphia, did some landscaping work and
                    eventually became a chauffeur for a family on the mainline of Philadelphia and
                    that's where he spent most of his career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, did your mother and father, how far up did they get
                        on the educational front?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: My father about third grade, my mother about eighth. Obviously, in those
                    days, again, this was early 20th century, when they came most of the kids
                    immediately went to work and they both did, so, you know, that's the way it
                    usually worked out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you speak Italian at home?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: I did when my grandparents were alive. I was the youngest child, came
                    along way late in life. My parents were in their mid to late 40s when I was
                    born. After my grandparents died, we didn't speak it that much. Obviously, my
                    older brother and sisters spoke it much better than I did. I did, again, until
                    my grandparents passed away. Then we tended not to use that much of it. I've
                    tried to maintain it but it's difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I served in Italy and so many children of immigrant
                        parents came and they thought they were talking Italian and the Italians
                        kind of looked at them because they were speaking a real dialect.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: As a matter of fact, I was back in Italy. I had an incident where an
                    American couple in a restaurant where I was asked me if I could ask the waiter
                    in Italian, because they heard me speak a little bit of Italian, where the
                    bathroom was. I asked the waiter and he didn't know what I was talking about and
                    I called my brother and said, “I always thought bathroom was _____.” He laughed
                    and said, “That's back house.” When they first came here, you know, their
                    bathrooms were outside and before they had indoor plumbing and it was “back
                    house” and of course, the dialect became _____. I thought it was an Italian
                    word.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your family how important was the Catholic Church?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>ZINNI: Oh, very important. Our local sort of Italian Catholic Church. Our
                    neighborhood was basically Polish, Irish, Italian and Mayflower Americans and
                    African Americans. The Polish, Irish and Italian each had their own Catholic
                    church. Ours was Saints Cosmos and Damien. I went to the grade school that was
                    associated with the church and I went to Catholic high school. The Irish Church,
                    if you will, Saint Matthew's, had the community high school that we all went to.
                    So, I had a Catholic education in elementary school and high school and then I
                    went to Villanova University so it continued on to college.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Italian church in the United States always seemed to
                        have, what I gather, a less heavy hand than the Irish Church on families.
                        Did you notice this at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: I didn't particularly notice any comparison. I mean, the churches were
                    actually very close and in my neighborhood there was a Polish, Irish and Italian
                    Catholic Church and there was a lot of intermarriage. As a matter of fact, my
                    brother and sisters and myself, we didn't marry Italians. So there was a lot of
                    association and obviously since there was one high school I didn't notice that
                    much difference. The churches were very much cooperative. I remember when we
                    were building a new church, the Italian church and the Polish church offered us
                    to use their facilities for mass and other things until our church was built so
                    again. You know, we all went to the same high school. The nuns were different
                    orders at the grade schools but then there was a mix of the nuns in a high
                    school. To me they all seemed to be pretty much at the same sort of level in
                    terms of dealing with their communities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it like growing up as a kid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: The area I grew up in was called Conshohocken, an Indian name. There's a
                    whole series of towns leading out on the Schuylkill River outside of
                    Philadelphia and they were traditionally mill towns along the river. In those
                    areas, you know, basically those are blue-collar communities. You graduated high
                    school and you went to work in one of the mills. That was kind of the routine.
                    You got a job in Ellinwood Steel Company, Lee Tires, Hamilton Paper Mill, you
                    know, one of the big mills out there, since all gone obviously, since all heavy
                    industry is gone. Actually, the towns have been rehabilitated into yuppie
                    communities outside Philadelphia now in beautiful old houses that where there.
                    It was kind of a typical blue-collar neighborhood. I think families were very
                    close. We tended to do the normal thing in terms of sports. It was probably a
                    good, solid environment to grow up in, I thought. Again, the influence of the
                    church, the friendships, it was an interracial, interethnic neighborhood so you
                    were exposed to everybody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There weren't Irish gangs and Jewish gangs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>ZINNI: No, nothing like that. I mean, we had community centers where we all went
                    together. You know, nothing more than maybe the normal frictions you might see
                    but nowhere near to any kind of ethnic friction or racial friction at any level.
                    In growing up we played sports together, we went to school together. It was a
                    fairly, you know, I think, healthy environment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At home in the family, was there much discussion on what
                        was going on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Yes, my parents were very politically astute. My father was a Republican
                    and my mother was a Democrat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your father was a Republican? I find that incredible,
                        coming from an immigrant, working background.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Well, because he went into the army and when he came out he worked up on
                    the main line with all these very wealthy families as a chauffeur and I think
                    that influenced him. Of course, my mother was in the garment industry and I had
                    relatives who were in the union but they were very much politically
                    knowledgeable and astute so I grew up in a house where politics was discussed a
                    lot. But I guess what I liked about it is you heard all views and to me it was
                    kind of a healthy environment. My father really believed in education despite
                    the fact that he didn't have much and my brother and sisters were not able to go
                    to college. I was the only one able and I had to work. I didn't go away to
                    college; I just commuted every day and worked. But he was able to afford the
                    tuition and I worked for the rest of it. The one thing that always impressed me
                    growing up, we had every magazine in the world, Time, Newsweek, US News and
                    World Report, Look, Colliers you name it, we had it. My father really believed
                    in making sure you were very aware of what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an era when magazines were extremely important..
                        This is how so much information was delivered.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>At school, were you much of a reader?</p>
                <p>ZINNI: Yes, I was. I mean, you had to be in Catholic school. The good sisters,
                    you know, your homework was unbelievable. I think we did like three hour's worth
                    of homework a night was the requirement and the academic load was pretty heavy.
                    If you had experienced, good nuns, then you better have your stuff together, so
                    it was pretty demanding. I mean, you could not help but be a reader. But besides
                    that, my father worked up on the main line and besides being chauffeur, he
                    really ran the estate for a very wealthy family. They would give him a lot of
                    books and things that he would bring home. One thing that I always remembered,
                    we had a lot of reading material, books and magazines and newspapers and
                    everything in the house.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall any books that were sort of
                        influential?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: There were a lot of policy books. I mean, he brought home a lot of books
                    that dealt with trying to advance world politics. His boss had been an officer
                    in the First World War, was a stockbroker, came from a very wealthy family line
                    and so did his wife so it was a lot of old money. You know, he was a member of
                    the Union League in Philadelphia. My father used to drive him down there for his
                    Union League meetings. I received an award from the Union League. I thought it
                    was interesting. My father used to drive his boss up there. I received an award
                    in Philadelphia. I always saw that building which is very unique in
                    Philadelphia. So the books tended to be current events kinds of books, which
                    made me I think, much more aware maybe than anybody else in my situation about
                    what was going on in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you interested in military history, in the military
                        particularly or was it just one of many things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: All the male members of my family served in the military. My father was
                    drafted in World War I, my cousins were drafted in World War II, fought in
                    Europe and the Pacific, my brother was drafted during the Korean War, my two
                    brothers-in-law were in the military and so military experience ran in the
                    family and of course, all the war stories and everything else. So when I was a
                    little kid I was interested in that. I was always much aware. In those days,
                    with the draft and everything, it was kind of an expectation. I mean, I remember
                    the men saying that's something you had to do, sort of a rite of passage to
                    manhood, to put your time in the military. I didn't think much about it. I kind
                    of accidentally joined the Marine Corps in college but I fully expected that I
                    would serve in the military. That was the expectation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of work would you be doing after school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: I worked in a haberdashery, a men's store and I was basically a stock boy
                    and a salesman. I also did other odd jobs, cut grass, did other things to make
                    money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Villanova, did you major in particular courses or

                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: I attended the business school and I was a business major. I received a
                    degree, a bachelor of science in economics.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the outside world intrude much on your way of thinking
                        during this time? It was the Cold War.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Yes. Like I said, we were very aware of what was going on. You asked about
                    books. I remember reading Red Star Over China and all these books and the
                    newspapers and magazines. I was very aware of what was going on. Amazingly, I
                    have memories going back, even though I was born in 1943, I have clear memories
                    of President Truman and the Korean War because my father was in the Korean War.
                    It just seemed to be around me. We did seem to be very conscious of all of that.
                    And conscious of politics. When I was in high school I worked for the Kennedy
                    campaign, actually met John Kennedy and so that was my real first exposure to
                    politics in a way. And again, when you're in high school you're basically
                    working on handing out pins and bumper stickers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it's being engaged.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Did you get any feel for Philadelphia politics at all? Or the area of
                    politics?</p>
                <p>ZINNI: Yes, we did. My brother had run for political office, just local political
                    office, and we were aware of the local politics, not overwhelmingly so, but, you
                    know, certainly conscious of it. I think my interest or at least what I mostly
                    read had more to do with national politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get into the Marine business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: I was the only one of my family to go to college and of course, I had to
                    commute as I said. On my first day on campus they had confused my major and
                    enrolled me in the engineer course when I was supposed to be in the business
                    course, so the first day at registration I was trying to sort this out. I was
                    very confused about all this business and I ran into someone from my high school
                    who was also going to Villanova. There were very few of us that went on to
                    college. I hooked up with him early in the morning and he said, “You know, while
                    you are in college you have to join the military” which wasn't true but I didn't
                    know that. I thought, “Oh my God. This is another thing I didn't know about and
                    to try to unscrew” and so I had that on my mind. During a lunch break I went
                    over to the student cafeteria and there were two marine officers in dress blues
                    beside a table with some posters on it and material and I walked over to them
                    and said, “I'd like to join.” You know, they kind of looked at me, “Join what?”
                    they said. “I don't know but I'm on my lunch break and I've got to take care of
                    this.” I thought it was like a registration.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>They signed me up for the platoon leaders' class which is a program that while
                    you are in college, you are in the reserves. You go away for two summers during
                    your college time and then upon graduation if you maintain a C or better
                    average, you are commissioned a second lieutenant. So I joined that day and
                    later went down to the main Philadelphia Navy Yard for my physical and then went
                    away in the summer between my freshman and sophomore years and then between my
                    junior and senior years, which was sort of, in effect, like boot camp and OCS
                    (Officer Candidate School), and then when I graduated I was commissioned a
                    second lieutenant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the marine process, the boot camp and all hit
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: I think it helped me mature and put a lot of discipline in what I was
                    doing. When I first went down there, I've always been a questioner of things. I
                    question things and you can take that for being a wise guy, I guess,
                    sometimes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You still have that reputation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: I still have that reputation. The pressure they put me under didn't faze
                    me that much. As somebody down there said, “How come this doesn't bother you
                    that much?” I said, “If you've gone to Catholic school and been under the nuns
                    and doing stuff, this can't put any more pressure.” I really think that whole
                    process of being part of the Marine Corps during college and the two summers
                    especially, you know, the traditional hard discipline of the military created, I
                    think, a couple of things in me. One, it gave me a lot more self-discipline and
                    self-control. The other thing, I really sort of was involved in athletics
                    peripherally. I played a little bit of basketball in high school, Babe Ruth
                    league baseball and that sort of thing but I wasn't that conscious, I don't
                    think anybody was, of physical fitness in the sense of the Marine Corps and, of
                    course, it gave you that sense of taking care of yourself in those terms. By the
                    time I graduated from college with my experience in the Marine Corps, I was
                    excited about this potential. I mean, I always thought when I got out of college
                    I would probably be drafted and serve my time or something but my future looked
                    like it would be in some sort of business somewhere. I wasn't too clear what
                    that would be. I wasn't too thrilled about all that, it didn't seem too exciting
                    and this was like an opportunity to spend a few years doing something that would
                    be an adventure with the military, particularly the Marine Corps, so I was
                    looking forward to it and I was greatly relieved that I didn't have to look for
                    a job right away. So the Marine Corps was appealing to me.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>So I graduated in 1965. I went off to Quantico, to our basic school where we
                    train lieutenants. While I was in basic school, we put the major ground
                    deployments into Vietnam. Prior to that there was no war, so to speak, so
                    Vietnam did not come until after I was in the Marine Corps and of course, that
                    changed my life because of the Vietnam War and my time there. I extended in the
                    Marine Corps and I accepted a regular commission in the Marine Corps from the
                    reserve commission and, you know, really didn't make a conscious decision. It
                    seemed the war was going on and I was involved in the war in the beginning as an
                    adviser to the Vietnamese marines, went to language school, spoke the language,
                    wore their uniform with them in villages and saw the war from a different
                    perspective. And the war really affected me and moved me. I went back for a
                    second tour as a company commander with the Marines. The next thing I knew, by
                    the time the war was over, I had 10 years of active duty and 14 years total in
                    the Marine Corps. I hadn't really made a conscious decision to stay in but by
                    then it seemed like I was committed and of course, I'm glad I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would like to talk to you in this interview about your
                        foreign affairs experience, your experience with the South Vietnamese
                        Marines. Did you know anything about Vietnam before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Nothing. Until the time I joined the Marine Corps I had never really been
                    outside the Philadelphia area, probably not more than a 50 mile radius from my
                    home and then in the Marine Corps I went to Quantico for training and my first
                    year I spent at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina in the second marine division, so
                    when I went to Vietnam, I mean, this was like going to a different planet. I
                    went to Army special warfare school before at Fort Bragg and there we had
                    language training by Vietnamese and Vietnamese families were contracted down
                    there to not only teach us the language, but also to expose us to the culture.
                    And when I got there it seemed so remarkable. The fact that here as a young
                    second lieutenant I was immersed in a totally different culture, new culture. I
                    rarely saw other Americans and the Vietnamese had a quartering act so when we
                    were in the populated areas we lived in the villages and of course, there were
                    only two officers to the battalions so I worked so I didn't have any other
                    Americans around me. I saw the war from a different perspective. When I came
                    back, and went to Quantico to train the second lieutenants, my contemporaries
                    were coming back from tours of duty with the first and third Marine divisions in
                    the north near the DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) in that area. The Vietnamese Marines
                    were their national strike force so they were the most elite of the Vietnamese
                    military. But they moved all over the country so I saw the war from the Delta
                    all the way up to the DMZ; in every poor area, every special zone, capital of
                    military District 1, everywhere. When I came back I had an entirely different
                    perspective on the war. I not only saw the war as it was being fought throughout
                    the country, because there are many differences, I saw it from the perspective
                    of the Vietnam people and the Vietnamese military and so I had a different
                    sense. In many ways, this whole business of hearts and minds struck me because I
                    began to realize we were not connecting to the hearts and minds and this is more
                    than just war in sort of a traditional, conventional sense. I think that made an
                    impression on me that lasted throughout my career.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's take the first tour while you were assigned to the
                        South Vietnamese marines. This was from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: This was 1967.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of, in the first place, the South
                        Vietnamese Marines?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: The Vietnamese Marines were very small when I was there. There were really
                    only five battalions fielded and a sixth battalion coming online. They were very
                    elite. They had sort of the same socialization process, as in the U.S. Marine
                    Corps, with a boot camp. They tended to be much more aggressive, courageous
                    fighters. They were considered along with the Vietnamese airborne, as what they
                    called the national strike force. So they were moved into hotspots all over the
                    country where they were needed. My impression of them is they were, in terms of
                    small unit tactics, small unit leadership, they were excellent. Obviously, they
                    did not have the firepower or conventional capability that the U.S. military
                    had. They didn't have the width and the logistics and things like that. Our role
                    as advisers became to make sure that when they operated with American units,
                    that we did the coordination, providing them with fire support, naval gunfire,
                    air artillery, logistics requirements. But in terms of their ability to operate
                    as small units down in battalion companies, platoon squad size, they were
                    excellent. And I learned a lot from them in terms of jungle craft, small unit
                    operations and how they operated in and around villages. They tended to be very
                    tough fighters. The exposure to the Vietnamese people, especially living in the
                    villages and everything gave me a whole sense of a culture that was very
                    different and alien to me but it also gave me a sense of, as I said before, a
                    perspective on the war that I don't think many Americans had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, as an adviser, a young second lieutenant, you
                        weren't really bringing an awfully lot to the table. It was a great training
                        experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: I was the only second lieutenant, true second lieutenant. I think there
                    were specialty advisers like motor transport officers and others that had been
                    enlisted and the more senior staff NCOs were commissioned. I was the only sort
                    of pure second lieutenant ever assigned to the advisory unit, as I was told and
                    that was because the advisory unit had a number of casualties and sickness. We
                    were also suffering casualties in the north. There was a shortage of officers
                    and so where this would normally be a captain's assignment, I was picked because
                    there was a shortage and they were down to the Z's, I guess, and sent over
                    there.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>You know, I would say in the overall scheme of things I learned a lot more than I
                    imparted. But, you know, the Vietnamese Marines tended to look at an adviser and
                    they wanted, first of all, to get an assessment of your courage and how you
                    handled yourself under fire and secondly, in the things they really counted you
                    on, your ability to deliver fire support, logistics support, transportation, you
                    know, helicopters and that sort of thing, how you got all that. And I have to
                    say, the American Marines in the advisory units, the captains and the majors
                    that were in there that I sort of had to get a fast lesson and learn from,
                    really schooled me up well, so it was a rapid learning process. I think I was
                    able to come up one step quickly because you have to. There was no other
                    way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find this unit worked with the local
                        population because this is often one of the key issues, when you talk about
                        hearts and minds, I mean.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: What I discovered in Vietnam is from region to region there were different
                    loyalties so we operated in certain places, obviously, where there were strong
                    loyalties to the South Vietnamese government, if you will, for one reason or
                    another, certainly in Catholic communities they tended to be, obviously, very
                    much more strongly oriented to the south and in communities maybe where they
                    received some benefits from the government, which I had to say, was maybe not
                    the most responsive to the needs of the people. There were other places we went
                    that were traditionally going back to the years of the Viet Minh, were
                    traditional Communist strongholds. Up in the northern part of South Vietnam
                    where we operated, we operated in an area of Binh Dinh province where the high
                    school diplomas and everything else had Ho Chi Minh's picture on them. These
                    were areas where Ho Chi Minh had left behind cadres after the French Indochina
                    War, again, to begin the insurgency. So, you ran into places where you weren't
                    as acceptable or they weren't as receptive to you as they might have been in
                    other areas. It was an awakening to me because the Vietnamese Marines had to go
                    up in the northern ICOR and put down the Buddhist revolt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say you were there at the time of the
                        Buddhist barbecue.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>ZINNI: I was there right after that. The Vietnamese Marines had gone up there and
                    actually confronted the first _____; the South Vietnamese Army division, and
                    there was a confrontation. While I was with the South Vietnamese marines, we
                    actually attacked another South Vietnamese unit. So, I mean, you know it was
                    interesting because you could see the differences. Obviously, we were all over
                    Vietnam, so not only among amongst the Vietnamese but some of the ethnically
                    different tribal groups and all that. You found it was a mixed bag in terms of
                    where you went. But the Vietnamese Marines were sensitive to that. They were not
                    that oriented to what I would call hearts and minds work. They viewed themselves
                    as combat troops. We did, while I was there, the first real work of trying to
                    get them to do things that involved sort of reaching out to the community. We
                    used to run these county fair operations that involved bringing medical aid and
                    working with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a program of sending out the Marines.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: The Marines in the north did the combined action platoons where they
                    intermixed with the people, with the local regional popular forces in the
                    villages. We were in the process of exposing the South Vietnamese Marines to
                    more of this sort of interaction with the local communities there. At first they
                    were very resistant to it. They really saw their job was to fight. Then, as they
                    began to see that it was successful and it connected to the villages and it paid
                    off in terms of in intelligence and cooperation, they were much more amenable to
                    it. I think bottom line is they really saw themselves as the national strike
                    force and war fighting was their business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at the situation there, particularly the corps
                        commanders or whatever they were in the Republic of South Vietnam, they tend
                        to be their rice bowl as far as there was a lot of corruption involved and
                        all this. They were not as willing to go out and fight.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>ZINNI: I think there were certain Army of the Republic of South Vietnam units
                    that were a mixed bag. You found some regular army units that were fairly good
                    and they ranged from that to terrible but I think when you looked at the more
                    elite units like the Vietnamese South Vietnamese Rangers that were in each of
                    the core areas and then the South Vietnamese airborne and marine corps, they
                    were very different. They were very courageous, very willing to fight. You know,
                    our recruits had “Kill Communists” tattooed on their arms and the Vietnamese
                    Marine Corps, the equivalent to USMC (United States Marine Corps), and those
                    were tattooed on their arms so that if they were ever captured, they were marked
                    as South Vietnamese marines and it made them fight harder and not be willing to
                    be taken prisoner. They had a lot of pride in what they did. I do think though,
                    they were politicized a great deal because they were the ones that took down the
                    palace at Yaminu and actually, the battalion I spent most of my time with was
                    actually the battalion that took Yaminu and executed them. While I was there, in
                    1967, there was an election and we brought all the Vietnamese Marine battalions
                    around Saigon and ringed Saigon for the election, ensuring the outcome. So the
                    Vietnamese Marines were seen as coup makers or, you know, if you wanted to win
                    the presidency, you had to have them on your side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you up against the North Vietnamese regulars or was
                        it its first time there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Because we were all over, we fought everything from what I would call the
                    Vietcong farmer by day, guerrilla by night, to the mainline Vietcong which were,
                    you know, full-time fighters, to South Vietnamese insurgents, to NVA (North
                    Vietnamese Army). We had experienced all of that and usually they knew by the
                    area they were going into what they might confront, which made them, they went
                    in stronger with more troops into certain areas than they would go into others.
                    What was interesting was not only experiencing all the geographic differences
                    from the Delta to the mangrove swamps in the south, to the mountains in the
                    north, to the villages along the coast and all that, you also experienced this
                    difference in enemies. One of the quickest things you had to learn is, of
                    course, there's a big difference between sort of part-time guerrillas in the
                    south and fighting them and the North Vietnamese regulars that you tended to
                    find more toward the north along the borders that were much more formidable. So
                    it wasn't a consistent kind of enemy that you faced and it required, I think,
                    the ability to adapt to that. So we faced it all when we were there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at this, when you're the new boy on the block, so
                        you have often a clearer eye, did you see an equivalency of North Vietnamese
                        to the Marine Corps? I mean, were these fighters as dedicated or was it a
                        mixed bag there too?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>ZINNI: I think clearly in terms of courage and willingness to fight, they
                    certainly had that. What you would expect. They were certainly not as
                    well-trained or technically competent. They were certainly not on a scale to
                    manage the kind of fire support and logistics in all the kinds of integration in
                    a major way. In other ways they might have been more skilled. I mean, in terms
                    obviously, because of their affinity to the people and when we got into the
                    villages and all, their ability to communicate and operate in amongst the people
                    was much better. Also, I thought some of their jungle craft and that sort of
                    thing were much more, they were much more skilled in that area. We didn't have
                    rations, for example, so when we operated in the jungle, for example we spent
                    time along the Cambodian border and elsewhere, really, truly in the jungles, we
                    would go out on patrol. We had to spend two hours a day foraging or hunting for
                    food. So you know, you learn a lot about what you could eat in the jungle, what
                    you can shoot and kill and how to prepare it by doing it all tactically at the
                    same time. Those are skills you don't have in the American forces because
                    obviously they know they're going to get resupplied. There was even reluctance
                    on their part even if they could be resupplied, they didn't like having
                    helicopters coming in to their position unless it was absolutely necessary, like
                    a medical evacuation or whatever. They didn't always get priority of American
                    helicopters and things so you know, for example, you take casualties, we took
                    wounded and in one case where we had to keep the wounded with us for a number of
                    days and so you now have to treat wounded over a period of time and it isn't
                    like an automatic evacuation. So in many ways, some of those kinds of basic
                    skills, interaction with the people, they were much better. I learned a lot from
                    them that you wouldn't have gotten. But in terms of the mood shoot and
                    communicating those skills, our NCOs are much better equipped to handle that.
                    Their training is much more involved. Obviously, we had much more technical
                    capability. I think it kind of panned out that way. I have to say the Vietnamese
                    Marines were very courageous. They were willing to put their lives on the line,
                    they were fighting and they viewed themselves as very elite. They were very
                    successful and performed well, especially in the small units.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left there after' 67, at the time, wither South
                        Vietnam? What did you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Well, I left right at the beginning of the Tet Offensive, you know, one of
                    the first battles of the Tet Offensive we'd fought in and by then I had lost a
                    lot of weight. I was down to about 123 pounds and I had contracted hepatitis and
                    mononucleosis. I had dysentery and malaria so I was evacuated right after some
                    of the first battles. We had a major battle up in Quang Tri and I left and
                    watched the Tet Offensive you know, basically from hospital beds.</p>
                <p>It was clear that militarily we had put a defeat on them but now we were
                    beginning to see the erosion of the American role in this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the States at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>ZINNI: Well, I made my way back through Guam and hospitals and all. I was now an
                    outpatient at Philadelphia hospital. I went down to Quantico at the base where
                    we train all our lieutenants and I was training them there.</p>
                <p>But I think we still felt this was winnable militarily and that we had to, you
                    know, you had to get through that, although we could see the erosion of the
                    American will. But what I began to wonder about after I left is what I had heard
                    from the Vietnamese people was this you know, what are you asking us to die for?
                    They would look at the government in the South in Saigon and say it's corrupt,
                    it's not responsive and what is it we're putting our lives on the line for? I
                    think as I reflected more back on it, I saw the people becoming more and more
                    apathetic if nothing else. They were just trying to get through this, survive
                    this. There were some very loyal to the south, like I said, Catholics and others
                    that were adverse to any kind of communists, but the vast majority of people I
                    ran into, they didn't relate to a side in this war. I mean, most of these people
                    were trying to survive. They didn't know if they were going to make it from day
                    to day. They didn't want to see American troops, South Vietnamese troops, North
                    Vietnamese troops or Vietcong around. It was all violence they could do without.
                    So as much as I was hearing about these hearts and minds, what I was seeing was
                    more body counts. There wasn't enough investment in this hearts and minds.</p>
                <p>When I went back in 1970 as a company commander, we obviously had started a
                    withdrawal. I began to wonder how this was going to work out because it didn't
                    seem like we were doing anything to end the insurgency. We were doing at a cost
                    and a price that probably we couldn't bear back here; definitely we couldn't
                    bear back here. We were winning every battle but we were not turning the tide in
                    terms of the people and so I began to doubt that this thing could turn out
                    positively. I saw two things that were missing; one was the ability to convince
                    the South Vietnamese people that there was something to die for, a government, a
                    future. You know, they didn't see it. It wasn't there. There were rotating
                    generals and coups in the South, we seemed to tolerate it and I think we were
                    losing them. The second thing, I believed that if you couldn't bring the war
                    home to the north, that was the second part of this. As long as, you know, some
                    odd bombing and all didn't make a difference to them, as long as the war wasn't
                    brought to their backyard of the North, for Ho Chi Minh and his successors this
                    war was going to continue on. They were going to continue the pressure. They
                    would fall back, come back, fall back, come back until they won the war in the
                    South. I think after the Tet Offensive they saw a crack in our goal and how to
                    exploit it.</p>
                <p>Those two pieces were never in place in my mind, so by 1970 when I was a company
                    commander, I began to have real serious questions about how this was going to
                    work out. I just didn't see how we were going to “win” and, of course, I was
                    wounded there and evacuated.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went back, you went through an experience very
                        few military officers would have and particularly in something like the
                        Marine Corps. You must've been the odd guy out. People who are used to going
                        together and a whole group of like-thinking Marines and all this and all of
                        a sudden you're seeing it from a different perspective. Did you find that
                        people kind of looked at you a little bit askance or were you a
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: No, just the opposite, I think, in many ways. Not only did I have that
                    first experience, but when I came back between tours of duty they valued that
                    experience. When I was at Quantico training second lieutenants, I was teaching
                    counter insurgency, I was teaching some of the unusual things that nobody had
                    experience in, like river operations. Since I had a connection to the people,
                    the language, and the South Vietnamese forces are much more interested in that.
                    We ran a mock Vietnamese village that we ran the troops through. I was put in
                    charge of that so I don't think they looked askance. They saw it as a valuable
                    set of experiences that they wanted to capitalize on so I found myself, in the
                    two years that I was back, the 2 � years that I was back, that I was
                    concentrating more, studying the insurgency, reading about it but people were
                    coming to me and other advisers. There were a few of us and drawing on that
                    because that was much different than the vast majority of experiences elsewhere.
                    We knew parts of Vietnam that no one else did because basically Marines were
                    concentrated in the north. Obviously, the language and the experience with the
                    people was very valuable to them so that by the time I came back, people
                    recognized you had a set of skills and experiences that was additive to
                    everybody else's and valuable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact while you were with the Marines
                        with the State Department, the CORDS (Civil Operations and Rural Development
                        Support) program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>ZINNI: Only peripherally. In some of the areas where we operated, they were
                    there. We would meet them. What always struck me was when we would take
                    prisoners, we could obviously communicate with them right there on the spot and
                    deal with them and sometimes, as a matter of fact, some of the North Vietnamese
                    and mainline Viet Cong prisoners we took had actually gone to military school
                    with some of our officers and had relationships there. One place we captured a
                    regimental field hospital and the doctor had gone to school with our battalion
                    doctor and they knew each other. So, in talking with the people, it always
                    seemed to me, with the revolutionary development cadres that came into the
                    villages, the CORDS program, those things were more feared by the enemy than
                    were combat units and they were more highly prized and targeted because
                    obviously, that could undermine the basis of the insurgency. I really came away
                    with the impression that we put too much emphasis on winning the war militarily
                    and that stuff, despite the rhetoric that was more marginal when it should've
                    been more balanced, because what I saw is like I said, you couldn't win this war
                    unless you had the people willing to sacrifice for it. We didn't give them
                    anything overall that they could sacrifice for and, secondly, if you weren't
                    taking the war to the door of the North, you know, they were getting a free
                    ride. They chose the time and place. And even at a tactical level I think
                    something like 80 to 90% of the engagements were initiated by the enemy so they
                    chose the time, the fight, usually the place to fight and how they wanted to
                    fight and I don't think you can win a war like that. I even became convinced —
                    because there's elements of fighting and war activity but it's in the context of
                    a larger conflict that has a political, humanitarian, social, economic element
                    to it — that we weren't paying as much attention to that I thought we
                    should.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came back you were with a unit. Where were
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: In the north, in I Corps, outside of Da Nang in the west. Most of our
                    operations were in the mountains.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>It just seemed that everything was just going through the motions at that point.
                    We had committed to withdraw. One of the Marine divisions were out, we were on a
                    downward slope, we were the remaining Marine division and they were planning to
                    remove one of the regiments so it was, the war was winding down for Americans.
                    The South Vietnamese military units seemed to be at that stage of the game well
                    equipped and I think conventionally capable. This was before we pulled the plug
                    on support of, you know, they had a 50-50 shot of fending off any major attacks
                    and of course, they did in the first eastern attacks and then in the second
                    offensive, you know, when they didn't have the wherewithal for full funding. But
                    I think the whole idea of a free-market economy, democracy, all the words that
                    we were saying, the rhetoric of free South Vietnam that had seemed to have worn
                    thin. It didn't seem to be there anymore. I don't think anybody was seeing a
                    clear way out of this by then other than we were going to leave and declare
                    victory and, you know, people were talking about maybe a decent interval. But to
                    me, it would be a matter of time. I felt the South Vietnamese as long as they
                    were given the wherewithal militarily, could fend off defeat but I think over
                    time they couldn't sustain it because nothing was happening in the South
                    politically, economically, socially to make the kinds of changes that struck at
                    the heart of the people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find with the Marines being an elite unit, were
                        they feeling some of the problems that certainly our Army felt?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Oh yes. I mean there was a draft. The Marines also had to receive draftees
                    as the Army did during Vietnam so it wasn't the all volunteer Marine Corps that
                    it had been in the interwar period and obviously, there were issues back here,
                    the racial issues, the drug culture and everything. I mean, all militaries are a
                    reflection of society, so those issues were washing over into the military too.
                    I mean, arguably, we didn't see it as bad as the Army but certainly we had our
                    moments that were very bad and you could see it. I think still the camaraderie
                    and still the sense of duty and pride was there. It amazed me watching the
                    courage of my troops and their performance in combat when clearly we were out.
                    This was an unpopular war. We had gone from anti-Vietnam to antiwar to
                    anti-military back here and so no one was under any illusion that they weren't
                    going to come back, couldn't wear a uniform. What you saw or what you tend to
                    see is troops performed for each other. They performed for the unit, they
                    performed for the military organization, they performed for their buddies and
                    there was no sense of we were here doing the same kinds of things we were doing
                    at the beginning of the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have problems with the racial problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>ZINNI: I didn't in Vietnam but when I was wounded and I was evacuated I spent 30
                    some days in Guam and of course, in different hospitals in Vietnam and the
                    Philippines. I was sent to Okinawa to finish out my tour and so I spent a number
                    of months in Okinawa. I commanded a headquarters company and then a guard
                    company there and the racial problems were really bad there. I mean, we reacted
                    to race riots. Of course, at that time the Okinawans had Okinawan communist
                    groups and they used to attack our posts and so I saw as much combat in Okinawa
                    dealing with race, there were racial gangs out there, Mau Maus, bushmasters and
                    actually, KKK's on all sides and my guard unit was reacting to all this. I think
                    we averaged about every third night we had some sort of major confrontation. I
                    learned a lot about riot control and all the measures that the police use when
                    they have to deal with major riots. So that was an interesting experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To move on, after you had an education of a future general
                        dealing with these matters, you had a pretty good education, didn't
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Yes, and of course, in the years after that. The marine corps tends to be
                    an organization with a lot of deployments. I counted up, I served in over 70
                    countries in one fashion or another; made deployments in the Mediterranean, the
                    Caribbean, the Pacific and was in Europe for several years with my family based
                    there, in Japan and so you really got this tremendous exposure to a whole number
                    of different cultures. And of course, in reacting to crises, different crises,
                    humanitarian missions, security crises in the Philippines and elsewhere and as a
                    general to the Kurdish situation, at Darfur, in Somalia three tours of duty
                    there and so on and on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I want to, in these various deployments, I mean
                        obviously we'll come to the Kurdish thing and the Somalia thing but prior to
                        that, did you have any what you might call significant education as far as
                        what you were doing and also what you processed when you were deployed in
                        any of these foreign countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Well, I think besides the military sort of evolution of your experience,
                    the war colleges and schools and command at different levels all the way up, I
                    think the most significant thing was the exposure to the different cultures.
                    Living overseas, operating in a number of different environments, working with
                    forces from different nations, so being involved in their environment and in
                    their culture so I think this whole exposure. I mean, we had a mission during
                    the Cold War to go to Norway so we had cold-weather training. We continued our
                    jungle training, mountain training, desert training and exposure to those
                    environments out there so it was sort of this global environment, being exposed
                    to that. And then not only commanding a unit in Okinawa, but I commanded a camp,
                    so then I was required to interact with the local community.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was on Okinawa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: This was on Okinawa. I had to work with the mayor of Kin, a town that my
                    base was located in and the assembly and so that gave me more exposure to, you
                    know, interaction of working with them and, you know, the social aspect and all
                    that, going to their funerals and to their weddings and everything else and
                    getting to know them on a personal basis, too. And the same thing in Europe and
                    elsewhere and so I think the most significant thing beside the military
                    experiences during that time was the exposure to such a variety of cultures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of cultures, talking about the higher education
                        in the military, the war colleges and all that, I have interviewed many
                        Foreign Service Officers who have gone to various war colleges and almost
                        invariably when I asked them to talk about their impressions of the of the
                        armed forces they come up and say to me that the Marine Corps officers who
                        reached these higher institutions of military learning were always the sort
                        of intellectual and thoughtful and I was wondering, can you give any reason
                        for this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: The Marine Corps is unique in several ways, in my experience. I spent a
                    lot of time in the joint world and that's not to take away from the other
                    services to produce magnificent officers. I think that first off you have to
                    understand that we grow up in an environment that puts us constantly around the
                    globe. I think until recent years the other services tended to be base-oriented.
                    We're not. We're in small units scattered around the world, make frequent
                    deployments. I think you're much more, you adapt and are much more comfortable
                    in that environment. I think because of that, too, you see the non-military
                    dimension more and so you get a greater appreciation for the other things that
                    you need to understand. You need to understand economics, politics, you know,
                    cultures and history. I also think in many ways the Marine Corps is much more
                    tolerant of mavericks. I mean, we tend to have a history of mavericks and a
                    history of people who are outspoken or their drummers are a little different
                    than most others. Despite the fact that it's almost a contradiction of being
                    such a highly disciplined organization, there is that tolerance for people and
                    so you can probably get a group of senior Marine officers in a room and be
                    amazed that there isn't a cookie-cutter sort of dimension to who they are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, looking at it from the outside one would think
                        while, you know, jar heads, you know, I mean. Who was the general in Central
                        America in the '20s and '30s? Yes, Smedley Butler.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>ZINNI: The Marine Corps has always, because its existence isn't automatic and
                    it's always been under challenge and under the gun; it's always had to ensure it
                    could clearly articulate what it contributed. I mean, there were debates after
                    World War I whether we should become more like the Army and large conventional
                    forces, whether we should focus on amphibious operations, whether we should
                    focus on the kinds of operations we were doing in the Caribbean and the
                    Philippines. Basically, we focused on the amphibious operation because I think
                    we were pressing enough and there were mavericks in the Marine Corps that saw
                    the war coming in the Pacific but we never left any of these. We tried to stay
                    balanced enough to deal with all of these. Plus, the Marine Corps has always
                    been innovative, not only in tactics and organization but technology. I mean, we
                    were the first to really develop use of the helicopter, amphibious tractors,
                    amphibious operations, special organizations within the military, very adaptable
                    structure, the air ground task force organized at a very low level. Even now
                    with the Osprey and the amphibious, which are very controversial, it tends to be
                    where we are. We tend to stay on a cutting edge in all these things and we are
                    highly willing to experiment, not only in terms of organization, tactics and
                    equipment but, I mean, in terms of thinking too. When General Cray was the
                    commandant, he actually generated a revolution in military thinking for the
                    Marine Corps, sort of a renaissance in looking at what was then called maneuver
                    warfare but it was not so much what the term might imply in terms of movement of
                    military. It was how you think about things, how you maneuver mentally and mind
                    set as opposed to thinking in terms of attrition, you know, where we had sort of
                    evolved to in the U.S. military to an attrition based thought process, where you
                    processed terrain and enemy troops. He wanted to think differently about that.
                    It exposed us more to thinking about, again, the non-military aspects of
                    conflicts you might face.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your next sort of really major commitment of foreign
                        operations was the Kurdish one, wasn't it? How did that come about? What had
                        you been doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Before that I had been involved in the Philippines in some humanitarian
                    work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about the Philippines. When was
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: This was in the late '80s, mid to late '80s. I was based in on Okinawa,
                    commander of the regiment in the marine expeditionary unit and there were all
                    sorts of problems in the Philippines with the NPA (New People's Army) and the
                    Communist guerrillas and other things and they had threatened an attack and
                    killed some airmen at Clark Air Force Base. They killed the attach�, Colonel
                    Rove, who had been a prisoner of war for a long time in Vietnam and so we went
                    down and reacted to a lot of that on security missions, spent a lot of time down
                    there, conducted humanitarian operations when typhoons came through and other
                    things and so that tended to be where we were for most of the crisis that we
                    faced.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of, you had obviously faced,
                        developed pretty good antennae for the foreign troops and the foreign
                        government; what was your impression of the Philippine army and other units
                        and of how it was working?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: We tended to work with the Philippine marines a lot and again, in
                    comparison to the other organizations within their military, it tended to be
                    maybe the more elite. And at the same time I was out there we were worked with
                    South Koreans, the South Korean marines which were again, very tough, an elite
                    force. So, the Marine units we operated with, in a relative sense, the others,
                    seemed to be and where they have the most problems is where they put the Marines
                    in terms of the Philippines. They tended to deploy them in the parts of the
                    Philippine Islands where they had the biggest problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That goes back to the Philippine war that we had at the
                        turn of the century.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: That was the tradition in the Marine Corps. If you served on Samar,
                    everyone had to stand when you entered the room. You know, they'd say, “Stand,
                    Gentlemen. He served at Samar,” because it was such a bloody, brutal battle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see or were you there long enough to see the
                        Philippine government with its military force doing some of the things you
                        sort of learned in Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: You know, I didn't understand the insurgency that much. We tended to be
                    out operating on a military to military level. Obviously, your exposure to the
                    Philippines at that time, Marcos of course was president, there seemed to be
                    from what I could detect a strong difference between the government and the
                    people's reaction to it, the government, in my mind. I don't want to overstate
                    this but it seemed to be headed for bigger problems in terms of its people
                    feeling that the government wasn't serving it. And, obviously, what happened to
                    Marcos later on.</p>
                <p>Much later in life I was to go back to the Philippines and do peace mediation
                    work with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the government of President
                    Arroyo.</p>

                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>ZINNI: I was the deputy director of operations for the European Command in
                    Stuttgart Germany and when the Gulf War kicked off, we put units into Turkey to
                    conduct airstrikes and special operations out of Turkey into Iraq, mainly in the
                    north. I was involved in the planning that went down called Proven Force, the
                    operation out of there, flew some missions with them, worked with some of the
                    special forces and others down there and had also worked in bringing Patriot
                    units down. I went down into Israel when we brought the Patriot units.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what that is?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Patriots were missile defense batteries that fired missiles to intercept
                    the scuds that were being fired by Saddam and so we had put a number of those
                    batteries into Israel. The Israelis were training on them and we had to speed up
                    their training and get one battery into there and I went down there to
                    coordinate with the Israeli Defense Forces, which was a very sensitive and
                    touchy mission because they did not like the fact that they were not able to,
                    for political reasons, not able to attack Iraq. For the first time they weren't
                    able to respond and react.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave that, what was your impression of the
                        Israeli military, because they are in the best and worst sense of the word a
                        very aggressive force and I would think that it would have been ... We have
                        never had a very happy military relationship with the Israelis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: The Israeli military doesn't want anybody else to fight for them, and
                    that's the first thing you have to realize. They do not like the idea that
                    somebody else has to come in and defend them. They want, they feel very strongly
                    that they want to do it on their own. The Israeli military has always struck me
                    as they clearly understand what's involved in their survival, who their enemy
                    is. They are very focused on those things. They tend not to get caught up in
                    peripheral things, in other words, you won't find an Israeli marching unit. When
                    you look in terms of the kinds of things we value in the military besides the
                    war fighting that we do, they dispense with all that. They are totally focused
                    on things. I found that, for example, when I was down there, they were being
                    “scudded.” They activated all their scientists, chemists and physicists and
                    everything and they would go to the scene of a scud impact, even one we shot
                    down. They would almost overnight reconstruct the scud and study it and they
                    were able to reconstruct and see. There were experiments Saddam was doing with
                    increasing range and warheads and everything else and so they are very
                    technically oriented, they are very adaptive, they are very focused on those
                    sorts of things.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>I think over time they have become confounded a bit in the way the war or the way
                    their conflict has moved from conventional, where they were dominant, to
                    unconventional where they are having major problems with that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Patriot was supposed to be sort of the salvation.
                        Everybody was very excited about the Patriot and then after the war there
                        was talk, well, they really weren't that good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: I think that was the first deployment of Patriot missiles. It was the
                    first generation of Patriot missiles. We found initially, we learned some
                    things. For example, when you put them on automatic, they would launch on
                    atmospheric clutter. So we learned some things that, you know, you can't put
                    them on sort of an automatic mode. The young lieutenants in the vans when these
                    scud missiles came in, because they were being fired at the max range they would
                    break up, and in the beginning literally what you saw on the scopes of the
                    screens was sort of fragmentation points and you didn't know which one to go
                    after because one is the warhead and the rest are pieces. They later learned
                    that they could, and the eyes of those lieutenants were so good that they could
                    see out of this sort of dispersal, this sort of fireworks like explosion you see
                    on a screen, they were able to pick out immediately the warhead because it
                    retained the same velocity. The others slowed down. I saw the tapes of that and
                    I couldn't tell you. They could and so they adapted to that and were able to
                    nail the warheads. Then one of the things that people misunderstand, it's a
                    point defense target. It defends, like, an airfield or a unit. When it reaches
                    out and hits something and engages it, that something is going to fall. Well,
                    when you're defending a city, when you defending from Haifa to Tel Aviv in that
                    large area, you defeat the missile that's incoming and you hit it but all that
                    debris is going to fall somewhere to and cause problems. I would say if you
                    would look at that, you saw how they adjusted and adapted and you saw, you know,
                    the impacts of successfully intercepted missiles. And again, you were seeing
                    first-generation, first deployment so when you looked at that I think overall it
                    was successful. Had it not been there and those scuds were allowed to just rain
                    in, I think there was only one casualty death and I think was a heart
                    attack.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I believe so, an elderly woman or something like

                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: And of course, we have later generations now of the Patriot and other
                    mechanisms for dealing with the missiles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you initially when you were working on the Turkish
                        thing, were the Turks sort of with us at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>ZINNI: I think when we first were sort of thinking about opening up a second
                    front, first of all, from the European command perspective we had to be very
                    careful in that, you know, we were going to do everything to support General
                    Schwarzkopf and Central Command. General Galvin who is our boss says, “Give him
                    anything he wants.” This was unusual for European Command because in the Cold
                    War we were the ones supported. Everything came to us. Now, for the first time,
                    we are supporting somebody else and things were leaving us that were coming in
                    so it was an adjustment to make. We sent units down, Seventh Corps, I mean, most
                    of the heavy units came out of European Command. The idea of opening a second
                    front was a little bit sensitive, first of all, from the military perspective,
                    in that General Galvin wanted to be sure it was acceptable to General
                    Schwarzkopf. General Schwarzkopf said, “Sure. We could open up a second front
                    and it makes sense.” And then the question became could we sell the Turks on
                    this? We went down to see then Ambassador Mort Abramowitz, who was ambassador to
                    Turkey. Marc Grossman was DCM. Frankly, I thought the Turks would never buy
                    this. Well, the first thing Ambassador Abramowitz said was, “Yes, it could be
                    possible if we do this right.” Then I watched him. He, working with the Turkish
                    government convinced them to do this. The Turks obviously wanted Patriots and
                    other things for their own protection and security and obviously, there was some
                    quid for that. I think they were very worried about their relationship with the
                    Kurds in the north, border controls and that sort of thing. They suffered a lot
                    economically for that commitment because the oil and gas trade that was going
                    back and forth across the border was stopped and halted. We tried when we went
                    in, in the aftermath, to work with the Kurds to ensure that we did as much as we
                    can to help support the Turkish economy. In other words, when we started feeding
                    the Kurds and other things we, and actually was in our interest, taxpayer
                    interests, we went to local trucks for transportation, local foodstuffs which
                    are more in line with their cultural food and actually much cheaper than
                    providing MRE's by airdrop.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: MRE is “meals ready to eat.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>How did the operation, Provide Comfort, evolve and what were you doing? Before I
                    get to that, when you're talking about a second front, what were we talking
                    about at that point?</p>
                <p>ZINNI: Obviously, there was a limit to the ability for example, for airstrikes
                    and everything else into Iraq from the south. This would expose all of Iraq to
                    attacks, would give us easier access into what was called the H areas in western
                    Iraq where the scuds were launched. So, you know, this did not get a safe haven,
                    you know, for Saddam anywhere in the country. I'm convinced that that is one of
                    the things that caused him to send airplanes to Iran, because he couldn't move
                    them back up into the North and keep them out of range or anything. So it had
                    advantages in terms of exposing all of Iraq. You gained another ally in Turkey
                    and a commitment into it and obviously because we did it with British and French
                    and all, you brought NATO involvement, not under a NATO flag but you brought
                    European involvement in from another area and a major NATO nation like Turkey
                    providing the base support. So there were a lot of advantages to it in the long
                    run.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Q; Well, we weren't talking as we were 10 years later of putting the fourth
                    division through and all that.</p>
                <p>ZINNI: Yes, yes. No, we considered that. Actually, the only reason it was decided
                    not to do it was because the war plans were already put in motion and General
                    Schwarzkopf felt that he had sufficient forces. There was no need for it but we
                    had actually worked up a plan for bringing ground forces, sizable ones through
                    Turkey. It just didn't seem necessary to do more than air and special operations
                    at that point. We actually even considered a deception where we made it seem
                    like and we set up headquarters, communications and other things. But the
                    deployment of forces in the south and the planning was so far along that it
                    didn't seem necessary. Remember, the objective was to remove them out of Kuwait.
                    Nobody was talking about going in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had a UN resolution that didn't call for the ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Right. We did plan for it and it was acceptable to everybody. It just
                    wasn't necessary or the time had passed to do anything and even looking at a
                    deception move in terms of that. We in EUCOM (United States European Command),
                    ever since the fall of the Wall, we were supposed to have this peace dividend
                    and new world order, the place was in a constant state of crisis. We had three
                    evacuations out of Africa, non-combatant evacuations, Zaire, Sierra Leone and
                    Liberia. The Balkans was starting stirring up; we had operation Provide Promise,
                    we were working in the Balkans. It was clear that Yugoslavia was coming apart
                    and then we had this commitment down in Darfur in the second front. So European
                    Command, what was normally, you know, NATO as the war fighter, European Command
                    tended to be the American support entity of that. The focus was in the planning
                    and logistics, very little on the operation side. Now all of a sudden the
                    operations piece of this was exploding. Ever since 1989 when the Wall came down,
                    our crisis action team and battle staff had been in being, the whole time I was
                    there. Those are members of the staff that come out to man a 24/7 operation and
                    so our command center, our people, were really beat. When the war ended, or
                    supposedly ended in the signing of the peace, it looked like for the first time
                    that we would get a break. It was on a Thursday we made the decision to stand
                    down the crisis action team and the battle staff and we get a call saying that
                    we knew the Kurds had revolted, if you will, and there was some fighting going
                    on and they were beginning to flee into Turkey and so we got a call that, not so
                    fast. There might be some need to react. Then we got another call on that Friday
                    that said, don't worry. Stand down. So Friday morning for the first time in well
                    over a year, we had issued the order to stand down the staff and the battle
                    staff. Now we had not been allowed off the post or anything. I mean, I had been
                    down into Turkey and into northern Iraq with a proven force mission but we
                    weren't even allowed off post because it was a threat to be out of barracks.
                    They had found some people observing and there were riots by anti-war people,
                    not riots, but demonstrations outside the gate.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>So that night myself and the J3 admiral, my boss, Admiral Leighton Smith, we
                    decide for the first time, we're going to go out to dinner. I mean, for the
                    first time this is over. You go out to dinner on Friday night and all of a
                    sudden in comes one of our colonels and says, “You have got to get back right
                    away. We've got another flak.” We had just issued the order to disband the
                    battle staff. We had to bring it right back in a matter of hours and when we got
                    there we got a call that Secretary of State Baker was flying to Southeast Turkey
                    to look at the Kurdish situation. We had to send some helicopters to support
                    him, to get him you know, from Incirlik out to the area. And he gets out there,
                    he's knee-deep in Kurds and sees this disaster and of course, the implications
                    were that they were incited to do this by the administration. Now they were left
                    stranded. It really looked bad. We get told right away that Baker says, he talks
                    to Cheney and talks to Powell and says, “We need to get humanitarian relief.” We
                    get a call saying within 36 hours we want food, medicine, water dropped to these
                    Kurds that are fleeing all throughout the hills of southeast Turkey and northern
                    Iraq. So we have to move back in the Air Force, the U.S. Air Force Europe
                    package. This time more emphasis on lift and bringing in riggers and everything
                    to airdrop supplies in addition to fighter escorts and all because this is still
                    Iraq we are over. So we had them back in in 36 hours and began to do these
                    drops.</p>
                <p>Now it's beginning to look like the flow of Kurds, the numbers are astronomical,
                    it's wintertime there, there are huge snowdrifts in the passes and there are
                    obviously deaths and it looks like we may have to do something more. I get told
                    get down there right away, just go down there for about a week and determine
                    what's happening and see what we need to do. So I leave and go down and I'm
                    there with the Air Force two-star, General Jim Jamieson, who is running the
                    airlift operation and it's now looking clearly like we are going to have a
                    humanitarian disaster on our hands. We're going to have to morph this into a
                    humanitarian relief effort so we're going to have to create a bigger operation
                    center, look at bringing some expertise down like civil affairs. We bring down
                    Special Forces battalion out of Europe with our special forces, the commander of
                    our special operations command Europe to get into the camps to try to organize
                    them and get some control.</p>
                <p>Then it evolves into a mission where we have 500,000 Kurds in Turkey that were we
                    are taking care of. We have about 10,000 that have died in the hills. We can't
                    sustain them in the hills anymore and we're going to have to bring them down
                    into northern Iraq. We are going to have to bring in other units to clear this.
                    Now the British and the French and you know, 13 nations have decided to commit
                    to us, the Italians, the Belgians. So this thing begins to explode. A seven day
                    mission, I stayed for seven months. We ended up having in the first phase to get
                    them organized and controlled and sustained and stabilized in the mountains,
                    which is very difficult. Then eventually we issued a demarche to the Iraqis to
                    pull out of the northern areas as we began to move in and move the Kurds back
                    home. Then we were stuck with the security zone that we have to maintain and we
                    did through air patrols and the military coordination center down there. We had
                    demanded that the Iraqis provide us a general officer for liaison in
                    coordinating all these efforts and pushing them back they did. They later
                    executed him.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>We ended up running Provide Comfort from the time I got there until the time it
                    sort of went over into an all air operation, sort of maintaining the security
                    zone for a period of about seven months. So when I went down there, I
                    immediately became the deputy commander of the operation under General Jamison.
                    Then, when we brought a large ground force down to go into northern Iraq,
                    General Shalikashvili came down, who was the deputy of the US Army Europe.
                    General Jamison became his deputy. I moved down to chief of staff. Then, when
                    General Shali left, when that phase was over, we went back up to General Jamison
                    and back up with me as the deputy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find one, putting together all these people?
                        The French, incidentally, and in this thing, was it Mrs. Mitterrand? She was
                        red hot. How did you find the French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: We had a bunch of things that were unique to this mission. One was
                    coordination with the United Nations. The High Commissioner for Refugees at that
                    time, Madame Ogata, because now we had refugees, had sent a liaison down so we
                    had this United Nations humanitarian and refugee organization we had to work
                    with. It wasn't simply a matter of you just pack them up and move them back. You
                    had to account for every one of them, everybody had to sign an agreement that
                    they were willing to go back. I mean, the procedures and process and the
                    uniqueness of the military coordination with this refugee and humanitarian
                    effort was different. The second thing that was unique is we had 60
                    nongovernmental organizations, NGOs, in there working with them, Medecins Sans
                    Frontieres, CARE, you name it. Getting them organized and creating a bridge to
                    them, we took what civil affairs normally structures a civil military operation
                    center, it's called a CMOC, an acronym, and we now used the CMOC as the link
                    with the NGOs It was the first time we really did that. That became the
                    model.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have to point out that this is really the first time
                        that the non-governmental organizations... There was a learning curve wasn't
                        there, on the military on both sides to you know, I mean this is now a right
                        arm.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: This was a model that was to repeat itself in the Balkans, in Somalia, in
                    Haiti and elsewhere and I think each time we learned something more. There were
                    some built-in problems. There are many NGOs that could not associate themselves
                    with the military by virtue of their charter or their ability to remain neutral.
                    How do you exchange information, coordinate but not do it in a formal way that
                    jeopardizes them? Obviously, the military presents I don't want to say a threat,
                    it's too strong a word, but there are friction points in conflicts and how you
                    do business. You know, they want to go where they want to go and not necessarily
                    where we see their need is, as the military, and who are we to say where they're
                    needed? We found ourselves, for example, in medical treatment trying to fill in
                    around them. They resent military involvement in humanitarian missions because
                    they feel that it detracts them from their credibility or even their credit
                    which they rely on for donors and all, when you're doing it in a military
                    sense.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>In many ways these were aspects we had to take into account of the operation that
                    I was unfamiliar with. For example, the Center for Disease Control was briefing
                    us on cholera and disease rates and water and all these sorts of things, that
                    you know, we aren't used to doing with a traumatized civilian populations at
                    this level at that time. That had to be figured in. And then there is the
                    security element that they don't normally take into account. So all these things
                    were very different. We have the Turkish government we had to deal with, who are
                    very sensitive to this, did not want to see the Kurds come flowing into Turkey.
                    They were keeping them in these camps that were very difficult to maintain up on
                    the border. We had a liaison; Marc Grossman the DCM came down as a liaison with
                    us, with the team from the embassy, which worked very well. They were very
                    helpful in getting us connected with Turkish contractors and allowed us to shift
                    over to local transportation, local foods, which as I said before, benefited
                    everybody. The Turkish government set up a parallel military chain dealing with
                    us so we had this sort of dual chain working with them. We're using their bases
                    and coordinate all this you know, with limited air strips and things out in the
                    region and we had to work with the NGOs and others who were competing for
                    control of these bases. We had to build a logistics network, not only for
                    military support but for humanitarian support, a distribution system through
                    that rugged area, through the mountains out on the border between Turkey and
                    Iraq. We had this military coordination center where we had to deal with the
                    Iraqi military to de-conflict movement and had to meet with them all the time
                    and that was a sensitive and kind of touchy business to do every day. So, there
                    were a lot of very unique elements to this thing not to mention that there were
                    mines out there. There were some confrontations with Iraqi forces. We had some
                    shootouts and other things that we had to get a handle on right away and clamp
                    down. We had the Peshmerga, the Kurdish guerrillas, that were operating on their
                    own, attacks on the Iraqis, you know, in the context of this. We had the threat
                    of Dead Soul, which was a terrorist insurgent group operating in Turkey that we
                    had to watch.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were Marxist?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Marxist elements, yes, inside that we had to worry about. We had the PKK
                    (Kurdistan Workers' Party) that we weren't unsure of their status because the
                    Turks were engaging them and although we never had a direct confrontation with
                    the PKK, they were on our terrorist list from the State Department and so there
                    was another element back in sort of the Turkish areas we had to work with. So
                    this was a very complex operation. I mean, since then you look at Somalia and
                    you look at the Balkans and look at Haiti and other things you see that that is
                    not as uncommon but at that time it was a very unique operation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was not a NATO operation although a lot of NATO
                        people. This was what, a UN operation or was it just sort of cobbled
                        together?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>ZINNI: This was the US-led coalition operating under a UN resolution. Thirteen
                    nations, the only non-NATO nation was Australia. They had a small
                    contingent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Turks must've been dancing all over the place in
                        concern about they didn't want a Kurdish state but that they didn't want all
                        the Kurds to come in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Well, they had a series of problems; they had the Dead Soul problem, they
                    had the PKK problem, they had their own Turkish problem. This is one they were
                    just beginning to recognize. Up until that point you couldn't even call them
                    Kurds. They were mountain Turks and even identifying them, you couldn't refer to
                    Kurdistan as such. They were very sensitive about what went on on that border.
                    We were very clear from our point of view, meaning the U.S., that we were not
                    there to make any political statements about Kurdish independence or something
                    else. But we had the British with a political office set up who were making
                    noises and Madame Mitterrand, in effect. This had nothing to do with their
                    militaries. Their militaries were fantastic, the French and the British and
                    Italians and everybody, the Spanish had sent a large group. They were
                    magnificent on the ground. There was a political element that was not in sync,
                    that was kind of washing around, you had to be careful with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about on the Kurdish side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Barzani and Talabani had agreed to cooperate with each other so we worked
                    with them. Again, they were not a problem. Their past friction between the two,
                    they resolved and they were cooperative in any way. They did manage to control
                    the Peshmerga, which we were concerned about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Peshmerga, did you find them or pay an effective
                        force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Oh yes. It was clear to me that if you took away the Iraqi artillery and
                    attack helicopters that the Peshmerga would have waxed the Iraqi military up in
                    those mountains.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about in the return? Essentially, we created a kind
                        of a Kurdistan, didn't we?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>ZINNI: A de facto security zone that became a Kurdistan. And, you know, initially
                    the Iraqis wanted to keep their police force and government organizations intact
                    up in those areas and we agreed to it but as soon as the Kurds came in, the
                    Peshmerga literally wiped out the police stations and mukhabarat and other
                    secret police so they couldn't keep anything. We had agreed that they wanted to
                    keep security and Saddam had eight palaces up there. They wanted to keep
                    security. Some of their security forces we allowed them to keep in the palaces
                    opened fire on the Royal Marines, which was a big mistake. We waxed them so then
                    we had to make them all leave. So basically the line was drawn and that was
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Kirkuk? Where did that fall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: We only went as far as Kirkuk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As long as you were involved with that, did you see an
                        effective Kurdish state evolving?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: At this time, believe it or not, Barzani and Talabani were going down to
                    Baghdad to confer with Saddam and, of course, Saddam is on the ropes now. I
                    mean, he's been defeated in the South and kicked out of Kuwait. He's been
                    humiliated. He has us now lodged in the north and he was making offers to them
                    about reconciliation and all this. Barzani was coming back saying you know,
                    should we accept some sort of arrangement? And basically, what I heard him
                    saying was, we can't accept anything that you won't underwrite. In other words,
                    the United States and the coalition had to underwrite it because without your
                    backing he could renege on it the next day.</p>
                <p>Talabani seemed more rejectionist to all this. He seemed to believe there is
                    something happening here. This could lead us to the state. Don't sign anything
                    with Saddam. You'll want to keep the security zone here. You want to keep the
                    planes flying. I mean, this is a way toward an end. I think Barzani was sort of
                    wondering if this wasn't a moment where they had an advantage. You had this
                    underwritten, they can get some sort of status, semi-autonomy or something like
                    that or a great deal of autonomy. Of course, the Turks were very nervous about
                    that. Every once in while the Turks, while we were there, were running
                    incursions there to whack the PKK. You know, they were pretty heavy-handed with
                    it. So this whole issue of whether this was going to lead to independence or not
                    and, of course, the French, Madame Mitterrand making noises, the British
                    political office they had running around out there in the sector making noises.
                    You know, we were trying to avoid this question, I mean, to bring this up. This
                    is not, you know, any indication of a Kurdish state or anything else. We were
                    trying to keep the lid on all this. Basically, it tended to die down once we had
                    gotten established.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Iranian Kurds play any role in this at the time?
                        Were they a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>ZINNI: The Kurds in Iraq fled mostly into Turkey and also a large number of them
                    fled east into Iran and initially, the discussion was how do we work with the
                    Iranian side? The Iranians were very resistant on any outside involvement or
                    support, humanitarian or otherwise with the Kurds that had fled across their
                    border. When the Italians first came in and were considering joining our
                    coalition, they actually went out to see if they could maybe participate with
                    the Iranians in this relief effort because there was a big need out there and
                    the Iranians rejected them a little too hard and they rejected the United
                    Nations involvement. So we basically were confined to working with the 500,000
                    Kurds that had fled up into Turkey and were still stuck in the mountains of
                    northern Iraq. The Iranians did not want any outside assistance and said they
                    would care and take care of the refugees that had fled across their borders so
                    that was completely separated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there while you were there sort of movements
                        around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: No movements out of Iran that I was aware of or anything like that. The
                    only thing out of Turkey were the activities of the PKK. The larger Kurdish
                    community outside the PKK weren't making any noises. Barzani and Talabani were
                    trying to show cooperation with the Turks because obviously they didn't want to,
                    you know, we needed them, the Turks, for this thing to work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With the PKK, were they just fighting their own war or
                        were they a destabilizing force or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: The PKK were Turkish Kurd insurgents, if you will. I mean, they were
                    fighting for a Turkish Kurdish state. They were obviously using terrorist
                    tactics, blowing up civilian targets and other things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there any affinity between the Barzani and the
                        Talabani elements of the Kurds and the PKK?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Officially, just the opposite.</p>

                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>ZINNI: We could not detect that. I mean, the Turks were always suspicious of it
                    thought there was safe haven inside Iraqi Kurdistan. But Barzani and Talabani
                    would cooperate with the Turks, at least officially and openly. The Turks came
                    across the border, did what they had to do, would notify us of what they were
                    going to do and there was no reaction by the Barzani/Talabani Peshmerga to that,
                    that we could to determine. I'm sure there was private communication.</p>

                        military at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>ZINNI: The Iraqi military were very reluctant to cooperate but they had been
                    cowed by the defeat in the south so on a day-to-day basis they assigned a
                    one-star general who later was executed by Saddam. As I understood it, some
                    members of his tribe were suspected of a coup since he was connected and talking
                    to us because he was assigned to talk to us, as a liaison. Saddam, taking no
                    chances, called him back. When there were big issues to be discussed, General
                    Shali would go down to the military coordination center, they would send a
                    three-star general from Baghdad; he was the director of intelligence. Or, some
                    high-ranking intelligence officer would come up. We were basically dictating to
                    them, “You will move back past this line, no ifs, ands or buts.” They would
                    object and go in and try to get exceptions and we would just say, “Do it, do
                    it.” The last one at the provincial capital of _____, Shali wanted to, since
                    they had been cooperative, since we are pushing them back, why don't we try to
                    do this as sort of an open city? We will only bring in military police and then
                    engineers and others. We will bring in no combat units if they withdraw since
                    they have been cooperative to this point to, you know, to sort of create a sense
                    of goodwill and cooperation because we wanted to leave the Kurds in good
                    standing. As soon as _____ heard that he said, “No.” Shali just exploded all
                    over and if you don't pull back, you know, we'll come in and. And then he said,
                    “Okay, we will.” And that was kind of a strange exchange. One of the Kurds there
                    said, when we were trying to figure out what that was all about, is he felt
                    that, he sensed some kind of weakness. Why would you, if you have all the guns
                    and power offer to do that? So there must be something wrong. He refused to
                    probe to see. You know, as soon as Shali came back and said, you know, we'll
                    move you if you don't move. Okay, you know. So basically they cooperated but
                    there were large numbers, there were numbers of Iraqi units in the north that
                    had not been in the war in the south. The ones that came up that were in the
                    South, there is a big difference. You flew over them with a helicopter or a jet
                    and they dove for cover, cowards. The other ones would take a pot shot once in a
                    while. We had to work through the coordination. As I said, we had some small
                    firefights and contacts. There were mines strewn all throughout the area. We
                    lost some troops to mines, the French did and others, we did, Americans. There
                    were constantly civilian casualties, little kids and all. These were minefields
                    that Saddam had planted all over the place.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you returned from there you had gotten a real Ph.D.
                        in the Middle East, hadn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you came back. How were you looking at Yugoslavia? Was
                        somebody sitting around making plans for Yugoslavia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>ZINNI: No. We were seeing the beginnings of things falling apart. We were
                    starting up this; well, first of all, I got pulled off on another mission, on
                    Operation Provide Hope in the former Soviet Union. Secretary Baker wanted to
                    start, or he titled an international Marshall Plan, to work with the republics
                    of the former Soviet Union to sort of build a relationship. General Galvin
                    wanted it to connect military to military to ensure that the Russian military
                    wasn't going to go back and try to snap things back, that this sense of hey, the
                    winners in this are the Soviet people, they're friends, there are no winners and
                    losers in this. So when I came back I immediately got sent to join Rich
                    Armitage. We were running a goodwill military mission where we were taking the
                    medical and food and other stocks we had stored for the Cold War in the
                    mountains of Germany in Pirmasens and other places and we were moving it to the
                    capitals of the republics for orphanages and the needy as a goodwill gesture. We
                    were running that military operation out of EUCOM and I was coordinating it for
                    EUCOM. We were based out of Frankfurt with Armitage and his team and I was then
                    assigned to his team. We were working with the government, especially the
                    Russian government, and trying to work with them on bringing in some investment,
                    on trying to convince them to move the ruble to a convertible currency, to bring
                    in some assistance and help and then moving toward international auditing
                    standards, working some humanitarian efforts. Armitage was going around Europe
                    and other places to try to create this international support for like a Marshall
                    Plan to help them build this bridge. We could never generate that international
                    support but I was caught up for about six or seven months doing that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: I was officially the military coordinator where there was a need for a
                    military mission like Operation Provide Hope where we did the airlift, we did
                    the supplies, the military supplies, and delivered them the medicine and if
                    there was any other military requirements. You know, support requirement.</p>
                <p>I was also working the military to military contacts under General Galvin and
                    General McCarthy, our deputy commander, where we were going over a number of
                    other NATO generals connecting with the Russian military, holding a series of
                    conferences the theme of which was to sort of share with them how militaries
                    function in a democracy, building communications and bridges. So I was doing
                    both those efforts.</p>
                <p>And then Armitage sort of brought me into the inner circle of his team and so I
                    was involved in some of the other economic and humanitarian issues. As you know,
                    we were beginning to look at mortality rates and medical conditions throughout.
                    The Russians were opening up much of their stuff to see where we could be of
                    assistance. I had another nonmilitary effort in working with Armitage too in
                    that area.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find working with the Soviet military, it was
                        still Soviet at that point, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the Russian military at that point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: They were resigned to, you know Marshal _____ was the head of the Russian
                    military. We met with their generals and senior leaders. They had just accepted
                    it. They were resigned to whatever fate this path was going to take them on.
                    They had no position one way or another. They weren't going to go to the
                    streets. They weren't going to try to do anything influential in any political
                    direction this thing took. They were wrestling with tremendous internal
                    problems. They had Russian units stranded in Germany and elsewhere, no place to
                    bring them back to. Soviet intervention military living in boxcars, families
                    stranded in the former republics in Eastern Europe. They had these tremendous
                    problems that now were beginning to surface, the hazing of troops was causing
                    thousands of deaths in the ranks, you know. And extortions by NCOs and others,
                    but they were really open about all this. They had a number of internal
                    problems. They were open to our discussion of, you know, the function of the
                    military in a democracy and all and how all that works. They would host us at
                    these conferences. I didn't think they were particularly enthusiastic but
                    neither were they resistant to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find it was pretty successful?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: I think any views you might have had that there was going to be some sort
                    of counter action, you know, to snap things back, then you realized that wasn't
                    going to happen. In the meantime, we're also doing military to military in
                    Eastern Europe which was much easier. I mean, Eastern Europeans were completely
                    ready to go west and so I was going around to some of the militaries in then
                    Czechoslovakia, Poland, Hungary, Romania, where we were connecting to them
                    building military relationships. I was speaking at their war colleges and other
                    things and so we were doing that piece of it too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we thinking about in Yugoslavia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>ZINNI: The more prescient of our intelligence officers were saying this place is
                    going to come apart like a cheap suitcase. Our senior intelligence officers were
                    focused on the former Soviet Union and ignoring it. I became convinced that the
                    junior intelligence officers were right. When Shali became the commander of
                    EUCOM we were asked, each of us senior staff officers, to tell him one thing we
                    thought was very important for him to hear and at this session I told him, “Sir,
                    the most important thing you're going to deal with in your tenure is SACEUR
                    (Supreme Allied Commander Europe), the most important issue in crisis, is going
                    to be Yugoslavia. It's going to come apart.” I was basing this on intelligence.
                    The senior director of intelligence, an Air Force three-star, jumped all over my
                    case and said, “That's BS. That's not going to happen. It's Russia and the
                    former Soviet Union. That's where he needs to be focused.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Sir, I'm just telling you this is what I think is going to happen.” Of
                    course, we were watching it as it was coming apart. Obviously, the Croats, the
                    Serbs had been letting things fall apart within Bosnia and then the whole thing
                    devolved. I left before...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: In 1992, in the summer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was anybody sitting around and saying, “All right. We'll
                        move the First Division into Bosnia?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: They weren't there yet. I think there were a lot of people that were
                    beginning to sense that this thing is going to become a crisis. But they were
                    very reluctant on committing a military. We just now did Iraq, we did Provide
                    Comfort; we did all this series of evacuation operations, we didn't really want
                    to become involved in this. The debate was whether this was a European problem,
                    whether it really should be NATO. We don't want to do a US-led coalition. Maybe
                    it should be the UN. NATO was still wrestling with out of area stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel you were getting tagged as sort of the person
                        to do exactly what the line officers in the military didn't want and that
                        was these equivalent to peripheral things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: I was getting tagged to do all of this stuff. I mean, I was always gone
                    and I was involved in all of these weird things. I mean, there was the business
                    with Armitage and humanitarian operations, these strange security lash ups, the
                    interaction with NGOs, the diplomatic missions. But I loved it. My sense was
                    that everybody else was beginning to feel this is the future. You've got to step
                    ahead into the future.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've talked to people involved in the sort of the
                        diplomatic Foreign Service, saying that their impression of the military was
                        well, if we go into Yugoslavia, we'll have to have half a million troops and
                        all. In other words, saying we can't do it. This had become the name of the
                        game. Even our government was very unhappy. We had sort of Yugoslav hands in
                        the State Department and elsewhere.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: You have to understand what was happening. At the same time, despite
                    General Galvin's warning, we were into this peace dividend; cut the size of the
                    military in Europe. We don't need them anymore. Bring them home. He was trying
                    to say, “whoa.” Before we do anything, let's understand what we want to do.
                    Where is NATO going, how many troops do we need to have here to be a significant
                    player in NATO? What are the potential threats rising up out of this because,
                    you know, you're popping the cork and it's going to be a different kind of
                    world. Nobody was listening. We were getting congressmen coming over saying, and
                    we were in free fall. So the Army and the Air Force particularly in Europe were
                    seeing these tremendous reductions in forces, these cuts. Officers were suddenly
                    getting their pink slips and senior NCOs. So the military was just sort of
                    evaporating before your eyes out there. Over 300 some thousand going down very
                    rapidly trying to reorganize, get rid of some of the infrastructure we had, and
                    questions within NATO, do we even need NATO anymore? Should it go away? It was
                    total, I don't think chaos, but there was such a confused state. There were so
                    many things going on positive and negative. The last thing somebody wanted to do
                    was get involved, get us all involved and jump the gun into something that maybe
                    wasn't necessary. Would Yugoslavia really come apart? Is this going to be a
                    smaller conflict? We don't want to take this on as a US-led coalition. Should
                    this be a NATO mission? Is it appropriate for NATO? Is it in the charter? Is it
                    a European issue? Remember now, Europe was trying to separate from NATO. There
                    was this WEU (Western European Union) and these other efforts that wanted a
                    non-NATO, all-European alternative to NATO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was a little later, but Europeans were saying

                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: I don't think it was that clear. Germany was in the midst of trying to
                    figure out reunification. Kohl was announcing the mark was going to be
                    equivalent, that they're going to retire senior officers but keep the Eastern
                    European military mechanism. There were so many things going on. I don't think
                    anybody was that focused on it and was willing to commit to it. There were too
                    many things going on that were affecting the military and the politics and
                    everything else in Europe. It was in a state. It was an interesting time.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll talk about that and then Somalia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>How did you see your responsibility for Africa?</p>
                <p>ZINNI: When I was in the European Command as the deputy operations officer, we
                    had most of Africa in our regional responsibilities, with the exception of the
                    Horn which was under CENTCOM. Frankly, I think European Command was obviously
                    oriented toward Western Europe, NATO, Eastern Europe. We had the Soviet Union
                    that just really collapsed and Eastern Europe opening up. I think our view was
                    more east-west than it was north-south. There wasn't much attention paid there.
                    Our deputy commander in chief was sort of responsible for looking after Africa
                    and certainly General McCarthy at the time, an Air Force general, and he tried
                    to get down there. We had formed an African committee that the chief of staff of
                    the European command headed up. The purpose was to look at what we could do in
                    the way of engagement and sort of helping any way you could toward stability in
                    the region. What struck me from that time was, first of all, European Command's
                    obvious focus was elsewhere and at that time we had the Balkans beginning to
                    come apart, we had the events with Saddam, we had the events with Saddam in
                    Kuwait, the Middle East peace process, so we were even consumed besides the
                    former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe which was coming up. Every time you tried
                    to do something in Africa it seems almost every year the so-called promising
                    countries or the takeoff countries had changed. What we thought was a takeoff
                    country no longer was, so it was like rolling the dice newly each sort of cycle
                    we'd go through; who to visit, who to engage with, who to look at security
                    systems programs, that sort of thing. Our role then became one primarily of
                    crisis management. There were three non-combatant evacuation operations we had
                    begun in Zaire, Sierra Leone and Liberia. Liberia was a chronic one. We were
                    just continuously, we were there for, had ships positioned off there to really
                    try to sustain the embassy there and we just became a travel service for
                    everybody coming in and out.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>And there were other problems in Africa; near evacuations, other things where we
                    were sort of put on alert and ready to move. I left the European Command with a
                    vision of Africa of this constant and chronic cycle of crises, humanitarian or
                    man-made problems and, you know, peacekeeping requirements that seemed to, you
                    know, you could fully commit the United Nations and the African Union and
                    coalition countries for the Anglophile and Francophile countries where they, you
                    know, obviously, they were sort of French led, British led missions to do the
                    same thing. I left CENTCOM and came back to be the deputy commander of Quantico,
                    where our research, development and education is based.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to move you back to Africa. Here you are a Marine
                        in a field of army officers. The Marines are trained to handle land troops
                        and here in Africa you had Marines whose job was basically to get people off
                        the shore and get them out rather than in. Did you have special training or
                        how did you get your people, your commanders there on these amphibious
                        ships, to be ready for this peculiar type of work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Marine expeditionary units that deploy in the Mediterranean and the
                    Western Pacific, we used to have a Caribbean deployment, and in those
                    deployments in the Mediterranean, the Western Pacific often times go into the
                    Gulf and elsewhere and some other deployments that we had that are not routine
                    ones but are scheduled as needed. There are 23 missions that you could simply be
                    trained for and one of them is non-combatant evacuation operations. So, that
                    type of mission, which is sort of an immediate crisis response mission, is done
                    with the Marines because their local sense of training stimulates doing this
                    before they deploy, to test it and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've got Liberia, Sierra Leone and I suppose Zaire and
                        all. Were you having consultations with embassy officers? I mean, to figure
                        out how is this going because these are pretty obvious places.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>ZINNI: Yes. First of all, from the position in the Unified Command you have that
                    connection day to day. If it looks like there's a crisis brewing or periods of
                    tension that there's sort of a voluntary evacuation or something more severe, we
                    began right away dusting off the evacuation plans, the embassy plans, and
                    communicating to them. Obviously, you have Marine security guards down there.
                    Sometimes we would even maybe deploy additional security like Marine security
                    guards and bolster it up. The Marine expeditionary units that came out, if they
                    were coming to EUCOM and those places they usually looked at those embassy plans
                    too, especially if they were places where we suspected there might be a problem,
                    so they were very much up to speed. When they went into those types of missions
                    they structured themselves. Like there was an embassy liaison team that the
                    Marines could form and they had already been pre- trained and pre-briefed to go
                    in and connect and provide the communication to work with the ambassador,
                    obviously, to make sure that they were working, obviously, he's the president's
                    representative, to his desires and how to coordinate everything within his
                    diplomatic security, his Marine security guard and that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time how did you view the cooperation between
                        basically the embassies and the Marines who might be called in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: I think was excellent. First of all, the embassies know the Marines. They
                    know them as Marine security guards so I mean a Marine isn't an alien, in those
                    terms. I think especially since the mid-1980s and maybe a little before this
                    sort of connection to ensure we could do these sorts of things there was a lot
                    of practice, rehearsal. When we would do the simulation and training sometimes
                    we would get State Department people that would come down and role-play for us,
                    the role of the ambassador to make sure we understood the considerations in the
                    ambassador's thinking as you go through this sort of thing. So the connections
                    were very strong and I never really saw on that level any friction or any
                    problem. It usually worked out well. Sometimes at the command level, the unified
                    command there might be some issues. In Liberia, for example, our initial mission
                    was to go down and conduct an evacuation. We got down there and obviously some
                    Marines went ashore to protect the embassy and the ambassador felt now that the
                    Marines are here, a company of Marines in our embassy and the battalion landing
                    team out there too, well, I don't need to leave.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>Well, we couldn't afford to leave those ships down there and the amphibious ready
                    group down there full time. We ended up having to leave a ship so between DOD
                    and DOS, you know, DOD wanted to get those troops out of there and back to other
                    missions, they had and training and everything else. State wanted to retain them
                    down there because this allowed them to maintain the embassy. Later on, in
                    CINCOM, I ran into the same situation after the bombing in Nairobi and Dar es
                    Salaam but in Nairobi, in particular. You could get cross ways in some of those
                    missions and I've got to say — and I'll talk later about Nairobi and some of the
                    other things — sometimes I felt the State Department was right. Sometimes I felt
                    DOD was right. I mean, it's not their mission to sustain an embassy that should
                    be evacuated, unless circumstances allow it. But, at other times — and again,
                    I'll talk about Nairobi, and DOD didn't agree with me on this but as the
                    regional commander, unified commander, I won out — I said, you know, the embassy
                    was in a transition and we needed to sustain the embassy there. The temporary
                    embassy, which was the best place they could get, was not in a very secure area
                    and it took a company of Marines to keep them in being. I thought it was
                    critically important that our embassy be up and running and it was critically
                    important that there was sufficient security. There was no other way around it
                    and there was no other alternative so I actually fought DOD in favor of a
                    security, you know, State's position on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel, I noticed you said your, sort of the
                        commander for that area was an Air Force General.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: The commander, in those days, the commander in chief was General John R.
                    Galvin, an Army four-star but he was also double hatted as Supreme Allied
                    Commander Europe. And so European Command is the American command and NATO is
                    obviously the alliance. So, he spent his time as commander up in Belgium and 90%
                    of his time was focused on the SACEUR job. So, the deputy commander who was also
                    a four-star Air Force, he basically ran the American command, the European
                    Command. In doing that, obviously, that was 95 countries from South Africa all
                    the way up to Norway, north Norway, so he had the broader sort of the U.S.
                    commitment. He tended to be the one that focused on Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at Africa, I mean there are certain places of kind
                        of ours, Liberia being one, you know, I mean traditionally and all, but
                        there were other places that were French or British and it seems just
                        looking at it from a distance that we all reached a certain agreement that
                        the American Air Force, we supplied the lift and other people sort of
                        supplied the troops. Was that kind of the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>ZINNI: There were other evacuations in Francophile and Anglophile countries while
                    we were there and the French and the British took the lead. There was this
                    understanding. There were places where we might take the lead; there were places
                    clearly where the French and the British took the lead on the evacuation or the
                    peacekeeping mission or the humanitarian mission and we might support it in some
                    way. In some cases they did it all but in other cases, we did support it. You
                    primarily looked at several areas; its strategic lift, its logistics, its
                    communications and its intelligence. Those are four areas of support that
                    oftentimes we may be called on to deliver. If we're not involved in the boots on
                    the ground we may do something in those areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find down in Africa cooperation with the
                        French and the British?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Excellent. Because of the nature of the kinds of problems we faced there,
                    you know, again it was either a natural disaster or some sort of peacekeeping or
                    peace enforcement mission or it was a non-combatant evacuation, and those things
                    tend not to be politically charged or controversial in any way.</p>
                <p>The French forces and British forces were used to working with us and obviously
                    through NATO and everything else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we mentioned before but although technically
                        France wasn't in NATO but I understand the military side and the
                        intelligence side, their cooperation was very close.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Yes, that's true, especially in those kinds of missions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you left. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Well, I went to Quantico.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>ZINNI: This was 1992. I came there as the deputy commanding general. I wasn't
                    there very long before Somalia obviously had gone to pot. President Bush 41
                    decided on a purely humanitarian basis, actually, made the decision after he had
                    lost the election but waiting for the inauguration, that he would send a U.S.
                    force in there to jumpstart the UN mission that was stalled. The UN mission was
                    very small, it was put in there under Chapter VI that was basically an agreement
                    by the parties there which had broken down. The UN committed there one small
                    Pakistani battalion. It was insufficient to protect the flow of humanitarian
                    food and shelter and medicine and the necessary things for the traumatized
                    population. His intent was to send a military, U.S. military, force in there to
                    provide sort of a military jumpstart to protect the areas to let the flow of
                    these humanitarian goods take place and then I think, President Bush foresaw
                    that within a few weeks or a month, the UN would come in there, they'd strike
                    their new mission and pull us out. I was at Quantico and we were beginning to
                    hear that the President had decided to do this and the question became whether
                    it would be a Marine-led joint task force, predominantly Marines, or it would be
                    the 18th Airborne Corps who would get it. The decision was made that it would be
                    Marines and it would be the First Marine Expeditionary Force, California-based,
                    who had CENTCOM responsibilities, Marine component responsibilities and they
                    would take it on.</p>
                <p>I went to my boss at Quantico and I told him, “You know, I just had this
                    experience, not only in Africa with the meals and other things but I had the
                    Provide Comfort experience with the Kurds and all that” and I said, “You know, I
                    could help in some of this because of, we understood how to work with the NGOs,
                    United Nations.” I had just been through all this experience and Quantico,
                    basically, because it's our schools, our doctrine center, development center, we
                    try to help the operational forces. He called the commanding general, Bob
                    Johnston of the First Marine Expeditionary Force and the Marine Corps and
                    offered my assistance. I thought it would be in the nature of assisting with the
                    planning, maybe going out and planning. I knew General Johnston from way back
                    when, we were lieutenant colonels together and he said, “I would like to have
                    you come as part of the joint task force.” The commandant then said, “Okay, you
                    can go out there as the chief of staff.” I mean, it was going to be a joint task
                    force so they looked to be getting an Army two-star general; General Johnston
                    was a three-star. I was brigadier general still. He said he would, the
                    commandant said, “You can have him as the chief of staff for the joint task
                    force. “ General Johnston called me up and said, “I don't want you to be the
                    chief of staff. I want you to be the operations officer. I need you to run the
                    operations.” And he said, “I know it's a little awkward because the chief of
                    staff will be a colonel and you'll be a brigadier general.”</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Well, of course, I loved it because I wanted to do the operational side. It's
                    much more fun than the chief of staff's side. I said, “I don't have any
                    problem.” I convinced the commandant that that this was the way to go and so I
                    went out to Camp Pendleton, joined up with them, helped them with the planning
                    part of this and then deployed to Mogadishu. We had the Marine expeditionary
                    unit out there that landed. You might remember that the lights and all that and
                    they seized the port and the airfield and then we came in right behind them,
                    about half a day later we flew in with the staff.</p>
                <p>We had on the way out there we stopped to see the commander in chief of CENTCOM
                    who was then General Joe Hoar, who I had known for a long time and actually had
                    briefed about all my experiences with Provide Comfort. He really supported me
                    going out and being part of the task force. General Hoar's vision for this,
                    because he saw it as a short time mission, he had a, what he called, a 3-3-1
                    composition of this task force. He wanted three African countries to join the
                    combined task force, he wanted three countries from the Gulf because CENTCOM was
                    focused on the Gulf, and he wanted to demonstrate that the Gulf States, we are
                    working together, we are coalition and one Western NATO country in there
                    too.</p>
                <p>Well, the Canadians had made a commitment to come so they were sending ships and
                    planes and had a pretty good force out there. They were working on getting the
                    African countries. They had a commitment from three: Nigeria, Botswana,
                    Zimbabwe, but it was going to take a little while with them to get there. The
                    Kuwaitis, the Emiratis and the Saudis would be the Gulf countries that would
                    take a little while to get there too.</p>
                <p>So our basic planning was around this idea. On the way out there, were flying out
                    there, while we are in the air literally, we get a call that the French had
                    decided to play. The French were going to come join us and the forces from
                    Djibouti are going to come in to Mogadishu. Then, we get a call that the French
                    insist that their general in Djibouti be the first general officer on the
                    ground, even before General Johnston. This sounded like Truman-MacArthur and the
                    legend about it and they insisted. And so General Johnston said, “No way. The
                    Marines are on the ground. I'm coming in as the first commander and the French
                    can come in later. We can work up a, initially, it's Marines, it's U.S.”</p>
                <p>In mid-air there was this big political brouhaha so finally we went out and we
                    land and General Johnston is, who by the way spoke fluent French, was Scottish
                    by birth and he had been battalion commander that first went into Beirut so he's
                    a little bit incensed by this. The poor French general that arrives right after
                    that, he's a great guy. I mean, he was a fantastic and the French forces were
                    fantastic. He was just a victim of the political back-and-forth. He lands on the
                    ground and he didn't care when he landed. He just wanted to contribute and help.
                    So that was kind of our introduction.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>We landed at the airport. We were trying to figure out where to set up the
                    command post. There were all sorts of alternatives; do it at the port and the
                    airfield which would be much better for security, much easier to maintain and
                    supply but we made the decision that it should be in the former U.S. embassy. So
                    we had to literally seize the embassy and the embassy was gutted, literally
                    destroyed. The wiring was pulled out of the wall, the granite floors ripped up
                    and everything else. When we got up there there were actually bodies all over
                    the place. There were some refugees or displaced people living in the embassy
                    which we had to round up and move out somewhere else so it was a horrible,
                    horrible stated condition. Obviously, people living there and not much paying
                    attention to sanitation, dying animals and dead bodies lying around. So we
                    cleaned up the embassy as best we could which was a gutted, burned out set of
                    buildings. It was a nice compound in the sense of the way it was structured. So
                    we set up our headquarters there.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, the president and the State Department had sent Ambassador Bob
                    Oakley as the president's special representative for the mission there and, of
                    course, he had been ambassador to Somalia. He was extremely helpful. He knew
                    everybody. He knew the military, he knew the situation and knew the people so he
                    came in. On the ground was the UN operation which was basically paralyzed. It
                    was under an Iraqi Kurd who was the special representative of the
                    secretary-general. It was like, as I mentioned before, a Pakistani battalion
                    down there and there was a brigadier general they had but they were basically at
                    the airfield under Chapter VI rules and really couldn't do much.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chapter VI means you can't use force. They are there sort
                        of by mutual agreement.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Exactly. There were over a hundred NGOs operating there. I think at one
                    time 120 so. A lot of NGOs running around, many of whom were really at risk and
                    there had been NGOs killed and other things happening where it was impossible
                    for them to deliver food. They had Somali gangs as security that they had hired.
                    That's where the term technical came from. The gangs had turned against them,
                    and I think they were paying them off and paying them bribes and allowing
                    certain amount of the food to be bled off. It got to the point where nothing
                    ever made it to the point where it was needed. So they were in pretty bad
                    shape.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>We had General Johnston in with a task force commanding it. We had Bob Oakley on
                    the ground and Bill Johnson who was the president of CARE came in to run the
                    UN's humanitarian operations center and if they were ever three people who
                    clicked, their personalities, objectives, were all on the same sheet of music.
                    It was remarkable. Bob Oakley comes in and asks for a meeting of the three and
                    they sort of structured this amazing concept that they would be sort of an
                    executive committee, one working on the political and other issues, one on the
                    security and one working at the humanitarian and that we need to make this
                    commitment to work together on all this. There were a lot of friction points,
                    believe me, but certainly not at the top. Bob had asked that obviously, he had a
                    very small team. I think he had less than a dozen people in there even if you
                    count public-relations and some of the others and the cooks and the bakers and
                    everything else. He had asked for support from the military side for some of his
                    political efforts. We had a small task force that was operating out of Mogadishu
                    doing airlifts and drops and there was a Marine brigadier general, Frank
                    Libutti, down there, perhaps he was a colonel at the time running that
                    operation, so he came up and we made him, we put him over with Bob and his
                    people on the political side.</p>
                <p>In the course of events, Bob wanted to form all these committees; a security
                    committee, a judicial committee. Every place you saw an opportunity to work with
                    the Somalis and do something constructive, he wanted to form a committee to work
                    it out, work with the Somalis and we were dealing with 15 faction leaders at the
                    time. He didn't, obviously have the people so he asked if we would provide the
                    people. So basically we did, because we kind of brought in a stable of officers
                    and took them out of the ranks, especially senior officers, colonels and such,
                    to work with Bob. They actually had to send home for their civilian suits. They
                    were to go off to Addis Ababa for the peace meetings, they worked on these
                    committees and I was on some of these committees and I became the chief of
                    police of Mogadishu and around the security committee. I was on the judicial
                    committee, the political committee.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>Also, we set up the civil military operations center so working with Bill
                    Johnson's people and working with the NGOs, we sort of had a clearinghouse where
                    we could share information, we could ensure that security was there. NGOs that
                    couldn't work directly with the military because of their charter, some
                    faith-based, some had to retain neutrality, the Red Cross and others, we were
                    able to sort of exchange information at a distance. They could check in and
                    wouldn't give the appearance of you know, anything more than slight cooperation
                    and coordination. It wasn't easy to run that. We put a number of colonels down
                    there to run that and other people, civil affairs and others to run that. NGOs
                    weren't comfortable with doing that in a real military setting at our
                    headquarters so we set that up in Mogadishu so it would be a separate entity
                    with security to coordinate it. It wasn't easy. It was probably the most complex
                    operation I've ever been involved in. We thought our mission was only for a few
                    weeks and that we would basically jumpstart it but we quickly learned that
                    Boutros-Ghali was not going to go after a Chapter VII and as we talked to his
                    representative in Mogadishu he says, “The Secretary-General is not going to buy
                    a poisoned apple.” So basically the United Nations wasn't moving forward on what
                    the first concept was at the jumpstart and so what we thought would be a few
                    weeks, turned into seven months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got there and in the interim, how did you find
                        the Somalis you had to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: There was chaos. There obviously was no government structure. There were
                    basically 15 warlords that had all staked out their piece of ground. Bob
                    immediately brought the two most prominent warlords who had split Mogadishu, Ali
                    Mahdi Mohamed, and Mohamed Farrah Aidid, and several other warlords together and
                    Bob started to work toward this sort of reconciliation, sort of the creation of
                    some sort of process for them to come together to eventually evolve into an
                    interim government and sort out how this was going to go. It was well received
                    initially and when we got there it was a very short time before we actually had
                    a meeting between Mohamed and Aidid. It was an interesting meeting where we had
                    dinner and brought the two together. They basically had agreed to try to work
                    something out. Bob had gotten them to agree to freeze everything in place.
                    Nobody would try to launch offenses or take land or anything like that. Now of
                    course, all the rules that were laid down were constantly broken. There were
                    always firefights. You had a mix of, besides the warlords you had these rogue
                    gangs out there. They were basically just armed gangs.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>They really felt they were Bruce Lee. They had to be out on the streets and shoot
                    or fight somebody. When we got there it was the Wild West. We simply stabilized
                    all of the outlying lands and Mogadishu, although it had its problems and there
                    were fights occasionally, we got it down to a reasonable security at the time.
                    We started getting in the situation where you know, to use sort of the Pottery
                    Barn example, not even if you broke it, you touched it and you owned it. We
                    touched it, we owned it. I wasn't there a week before there was this group of
                    so-called Somali intellectuals who wanted to meet with me and they came to see
                    me and they wanted to talk about when we were going to start the jobs program
                    and when we were going to do these other things. And Bob had realized the police
                    were always respected. They weren't part of the previous dictator's regime of
                    oppression. A couple of the old policemen put their uniforms on, came out on the
                    streets, started directing traffic. People gathered around them. Market stalls
                    opened up. They brought this sense of security and hope back. So, he decides we
                    need to reinstall the police. The United Nations wouldn't take the job on and we
                    were getting a little close to the wall, our own wall, about the military
                    training police. We weren't training police, we were reestablishing the prisons,
                    setting up the courts, we were doing everything in there. Basically, we were
                    into nation building big time. We were running the peace mediation and we were
                    overseeing and securing the humanitarian work. We were beginning to even get
                    into economic reconstruction. I mean, people were brought in to look at the
                    monetary system, sort of different monetary kinds of money running around and
                    how it would be balanced and work, and how the monetary system would work. NGOs
                    were now moving in some cases beyond just providing basic needs but creating
                    markets, beginning to sell food at a nominal rate to create trade and business
                    and some places were beginning to move on.</p>
                <p>We had about nine sectors. We were in southern Somalia, northern Somalia.
                    Somaliland is stable and didn't have a requirement for humanitarian aid so
                    basically we worked from mid-Somalia down to the south. We had a lot of
                    incidents. The warlords would go at each other. We would get hit or attacked, so
                    there was this on again off again kind of low grade conflict that would spike
                    once in awhile. But by the time May rolled around, and we went in in
                    December...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was '92?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: We went in in December of 1992, and finally Boutros-Ghali had extracted
                    from the Clinton Administration, which inherited this mission, the agreement
                    that if he were to solicit for Chapter VII for us, the United States would
                    provide a quick reaction force. They wanted a strong military U.S. presence and
                    would provide logistic support and the logistics. The U.S. military was not
                    interested in doing this. This was supposed to be a couple of weeks, and now it
                    has turned into months and months. Now it has turned into we're going to get a
                    major commitment to this UN operation and that was sort of the extortion for him
                    going forward on the Chapter VII. The Clinton Administration agreed to it so
                    basically, in May we turned over the operation to the UN.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>And the other requirement Boutros-Ghali made later on was the special
                    representative to the secretary-general had to be an American. So retired
                    Admiral General Jonathan Howe, who had been on the National Security Council,
                    rather came in as the special representative and frankly, we were involved in
                    the turnover which took forever with the UN staff, both the secretary-general's
                    representative staff and the military staff. The military was under a Turkish
                    general, General Cevik Bir. It was obvious that from the military side they were
                    not getting, other than the Americans, many significant contributors, many that
                    would be willing to stay around and contribute, not the numbers they felt they
                    needed on the ground and they were very hesitant to take it, take control of the
                    command. They finally did in May.</p>
                <p>As we were getting ready to leave and we were sort of turning over and at that
                    stage of the game it looked very promising. There were meetings in Addis Ababa
                    that Oakley had orchestrated, the UN had run. The warlords had written some
                    agreements on an interim government and a future way of moving forward on
                    consultations and conferences to develop a permanent structure.</p>
                <p>Mogadishu was relatively quiet but the vision of the United Nations really
                    concerned us as we were going out. They didn't understand the fragility of the
                    situation and they didn't understand how to deal with the warlords. I think they
                    thought we had the warlords completely cowed and they can walk in and begin to
                    dictate who plays. Oakley's philosophy was everybody has a seat at the table.
                    We're not going to tell Somalis who should sit at the table. The only reason we
                    would take action to expel you from the process if you did something
                    unacceptable. He kept them all at the table. The United Nations came in and
                    began to decide, Aidid is out, this guy is in, and make these decisions.</p>
                <p>What concerned me and General Johnston, the Somalis were getting confused. Now
                    there was a shift in policy, a shift in approach. Everything we had done, now
                    the UN is coming in and had a different approach. When Bob Oakley left and his
                    successor came in, he had a different approach than Oakley. So you had now the
                    Somalis who had seen the first UN operation, UNISOM I which didn't work, and
                    then they saw the U.S. led coalition come in, now they were seeing the UN and so
                    they were seeing another change. We had great fear that this thing was going to
                    come apart. We felt it was in good shape but very fragile, moving in the right
                    direction. We saw all the approaches that Admiral Howe and the United Nations
                    were going to take that were going to not work.</p>
                <p>As we were leaving, the day we left, we did the changeover of command, if you

                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>ZINNI: May of 1993. We were the last ones out. We were in two Humvees driving
                    from the embassy down to the airport. You've got to imagine that either before
                    or after in two Humvees, we had a couple of Marines with rifles but just that
                    kind of minimal security. We couldn't have done that before we got there and we
                    certainly couldn't have done it after we left but we drove down and it was a
                    beautiful, sunny day. It was very quiet. The incidents in Mogadishu were very
                    light.</p>
                <p>Bob was just very quiet, just had nothing to say after it and he suddenly saw a
                    couple of kids, young kids with schoolbooks on a street corner. He told us to
                    stop. We got out and went over to the kids and talked to them. And he asked all
                    of us, “Give me all your pens.” We were reaching in our pockets, getting all our
                    pens and pencils and things and he collected them all and gave them to the kids
                    who were very appreciative and the kids were thankful and went off. And he just
                    stood there and we had our plane waiting, we're going to get out of here, we
                    were done. And I said to him,” What are you thinking about?”</p>
                <p>He said, “30 days.”</p>
                <p>I said, “What do you mean, 30 days?”</p>
                <p>He said, “In 30 days this place is going to blow up.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Really?”</p>
                <p>He said, “The UN approach to this thing is a disaster.”</p>
                <p>Thirty one days later we had the attack on the Pakistanis that took place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, there is another aspect. You talk about
                        Mogadishu. As I recall a real emphasis at the beginning was to get food and
                        there was a central place inside Somalia which was the place where the
                        trucks kept getting ambushed on the way. How was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: The most difficult places were out along the Ethiopian border or on the
                    way out. The places like Baidoa and Mandera, those with the most extreme places.
                    It's desolate country. There's scrub growth just desert-like terrain. The people
                    out there were really in bad shape and of course, the gangs were out there. It
                    was outside Mogadishu. We really didn't have many problems in Mogadishu. We
                    pretty quickly gained cooperation and we had enough troops in there. In less
                    than 19 days we had security in all of that area, and that area was bigger than
                    the size of Texas, we had security in all the areas; we had the flow of food and
                    everything. From nothing going out there, in 19 days we had it fully operational
                    and with sufficient security for the convoys, the distribution points, the NGOs
                    to go to these areas.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>We broke the place down into nine sectors and basically we took a large
                    contingent, like the French or the Canadians, they had a big sector, and then
                    some of the smaller commitments that would come in from other nations, we would
                    put them with them. What turned out to be this 1 concept quickly ended up in a
                    flood of people offering forces. By the time we left in May we had the forces
                    from 26 countries in there and it almost got to be too much and many of the
                    contributions really didn't add anything. They became more of a drain
                    logistically than they contributed. The State Department was sending a list
                    everyday of potential contributing countries. They wanted as many as possible to
                    show their flags. We were running out of the ability to cope with these. We
                    didn't have that many big contributions that were sort of self contained, units
                    that come that are solely totally self-contained, provide their own logistics
                    like the Canadians and the French. We were getting little contingents that were
                    totally dependent on us and when we left they had 44 possible contributors. We
                    had 26 but they have 44 on the books willing to contribute. I don't know where
                    we would have put them all but they were in line to come had we not turned it
                    over to the United Nations. That willingness to come under U.S. command and be
                    part of this operation, that didn't carry over to the UN piece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. You've got Baidoa which is way up. You've got these
                        technical bandits running around. How did you face them down, you and your
                        troops?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Well, several ways. Obviously, out at the places, at the towns and at the
                    distribution centers we had security there that they couldn't come in and take a
                    shot in the middle of the night and run away. Where we were actually located,
                    the civilian population, the humanitarian distribution points and that sort of
                    thing, we had plenty of security. The routes out there were secure. In other
                    words, when we ran convoys, we had security. But obviously, they could run
                    around between these areas. There was a lot of open area. We ran patrols out
                    there, we ran reconnaissance units you know, special forces, Marine
                    reconnaissance. We had helicopter and aerial surveillance and satellite
                    intelligence so we had a lot of ways to look at the ground. It wasn't perfect,
                    obviously, but a lot of ways to look at the ground in between.</p>
                <p>We had some pretty significant dustups. If they attempted to come at us, they
                    paid a great price. They learned that pretty quickly. You had the odd gang in
                    Mogadishu that would take a shot, a couple of times they took a few shots and we
                    took out a few of their compounds. We had agreed to let the militias canton
                    their weapons but they couldn't move the weapons in and out. We conducted
                    inspections. I think in the total course from December until May we had two
                    killed and seven wounded on the U.S. side and some other coalition casualties
                    but they weren't significant. We did mix it up a little bit. We did inflict some
                    casualties on the other side but they had initiated it.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>I was on the security committee and the security committee was composed of the
                    senior security officers of the militias and the warlords. Any time you had one
                    of these dustups we would come in and meet and I would always explain what had
                    happened. Of course, they always had a different version from their gangs and
                    all. We had developed a very close personal relationship and I was always
                    saying, “Look, this could be the end of the matter. Don't you trust me to say we
                    were prudent in the use of force? It was only self-defense. If you're not, and
                    you decide this is a causus belli, we've got to go to war, so be it. Do you
                    really want that?” And in each case they didn't. As a matter of fact, I actually
                    had them, they confided in, me although their bosses may want you to please you,
                    to give you a sense of their power, that they control all these clans and
                    militias and they are all loyal to them and under their absolute control, they
                    were not. There are some deals that are cut, rogue militias that are sort of
                    quasi-compliant with the chain of command and go off on their own, do their own
                    thing. They are like gangs that sort of sign up. We knew that from our own
                    intelligence, so you know, they didn't have full control. If those gangs got off
                    the reservation and we had a dustup, they weren't going to use that as a cause
                    for the entire warlord structure to go behind them, certainly.</p>
                <p>In many ways, we defused many things. When the UN started coming in before we
                    turned over [inaudible]. [Inaudible] told me there were gangs even within his
                    own organization that were going to shoot up UN vehicles because they were
                    painted white. But, he said, if you have the green vehicles, meaning our
                    Humvees, mixed in with them, they won't take them out. So we made sure there
                    were patrols with the green Humvees. The one guy that violated the rule, no
                    white vehicles out on their own, was the U.S. deputy commander of the UN
                    military task force. His driver went out and got the vehicle shot up but,
                    fortunately, he wasn't hurt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the NGOs? How did they fit in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Very difficult. It was not the same relationship that we had. In Provide
                    Comfort, I would say we were feeling each other out. There were a number of NGOs
                    that were very hesitant, reticent to cooperate but we really didn't have a lot
                    of friction. Somalia was different. The NGOs resented the fact that they were
                    there before we got there. They had been through hell. Now we came in and looked
                    like the heroes. This was their perception, when they had been there before and
                    been out in danger delivering food as best they can, we suddenly come in and we
                    get all the press and the headlines, the military. It was clear that this was
                    not a humanitarian mission. We did not get humanitarian service medals for this.
                    Our job was to provide security. It was actually a security mission, security
                    for the NGOs. They were doing the humanitarian work. We did some of an emergency
                    nature that was needed. The NGOs perceived that we were stealing their glory
                    that they had earned.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>The NGOs were suffering casualties. They had suffered three or four killed. While
                    we were there a number were wounded, they were being ripped off by their own
                    security. Their version of security and ours were different. They saw that we
                    would come in and assign them their own platoon of Marines. There were 500 and
                    some NGO facilities in Mogadishu. It was impossible to secure all of them. I
                    mean, we could provide general security for Mogadishu but they had 500 and some
                    warehouses, offices, residences and when we asked them to try to consolidate
                    some of these so would be easier to secure they snapped back at us. We couldn't
                    dictate to them where to go. They thought that they should have full-time
                    security and at night they would have their social events, parties and all that.
                    We in the military weren't doing that and they expected us to provide security
                    for that. We got off in many ways with some of the NGOs, maybe many of the NGOs
                    on a wrong foot. The civil military operation center worked well with them but
                    they kind of viewed the uniformed guys in that sort of differently from the rest
                    of us. There was a lot of tension. Bill Johnson and Bob Oakley helped a lot to
                    smooth that over. I think the cultural differences with so many NGOs in there,
                    and not just American NGOs but from all over, they had a sort of natural
                    reticence to deal with the military and again, looking at us, in their view
                    stealing the glory I think, didn't help. So over the seven months we made it
                    work. We tried our best I think, on both sides to get the relationships going.
                    In the aftermath of all that, we learned a lot and we agreed to sit down and
                    kind of go over where the rubs were and try to work them out.</p>
                <p>I came back from that and became the commanding general of the First Marine
                    Expeditionary Force. We had started a program and we brought NGOs out there. We
                    brought people from the political side, it was a program designed to sit down
                    and talk through these kind of humanitarian missions, how we work better with
                    each other, how we explain to each other our roles and coordinate all this and
                    this was sort of burned into my soul from Provide Comfort and Restore Hope in
                    these missions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say you went back twice. What were they and when did
                        you do that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>ZINNI: I'm back at Quantico in my job as the deputy and I'm watching. Now we have
                    the attacks in June on the Pakistani group and the radio station and they go
                    into a war mode. The UN is basically at war with the [inaudible] clan and
                    others. And the casualties, the daily reporting. I talked to Bob Oakley. He was
                    back here and we were both sick. It seemed like everything we had tried to build
                    had just collapsed. I was down at, I had been selected for the grade of major
                    general. I went to this course we had down at Maxwell Air Force Base where it's
                    a joint course for two-stars. Newt Gingrich came down to speak to us and
                    Gingrich had started to talk about Somalia. Somebody said, you know we have
                    somebody here, and I happened to be sitting right next to him, who had been to
                    Somalia so he said I'd like to talk to the guy. We struck up this conversation
                    at the break and there was this long discussion about Somalia. And he was asking
                    me a lot of questions. A few weeks later we had the Black Hawk Down incident. It
                    seems to me October, you know, the incident with the Rangers and the special
                    operations forces. I got a call the night that that happened from Newt
                    Gingrich.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was Speaker of the House or the majority leader?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: No, he wasn't Speaker of the House. Yes. And he said to me, “Look, the
                    president,” it was President Clinton, “has called a meeting at the White House,
                    bipartisan, to discuss the future course in Somalia.” He said, “We're looking
                    into options; one is to send a massive force in, tanks and everything else
                    because Montgomery wanted tanks or to completely withdraw and pull out.” He
                    said, “What's your take?” I said, “Well, if those are the only two options on
                    the table, pull out.” I said, “If you just send all those forces and tanks,
                    you're going to kill lots of Somalis and going to get more of our troops killed
                    and you're not going to accomplish anything.” So, I said, “That's not why you're
                    there in the first place, you know, it's descended into this hail storm.” And he
                    said, “Well, what other option is there?” I said, “I believe you could fix it. I
                    believe this thing got off because there was a misunderstanding and the policy
                    at the UN but I think you could right the ship.” And he said “Well, who can do
                    that? I said, “Bob Oakley can do that. Bob is the guy the Somalis listen to and
                    respect. He can go over there and get the shooting to stop and get it back onto
                    some sort of political track and sort it out.” He said, “Well, thanks.”</p>
                <p>The next night I'm at home and I get a call from the commandant of the Marine
                    Corps and he says, “What do you know about Bob Oakley going to Somalia and Newt
                    Gingrich recommending and all this stuff?” I said, “Well, I have to confess,
                    Gingrich called me and I recommended this.” He said, “Well”, and this is going
                    on midnight, “at six o'clock tomorrow morning you be at Andrews Air Force Base.
                    We'll have the whole kit packed up because Oakley has requested that you go with
                    him on this mission.” Oh, God. I was at Quantico and I had to be up I was up
                    packing my stuff, you know, and I show up at Andrews Air Force Base and there's
                    Bob Oakley. In the end we got this Air Force C 21 revving its engines, ready to
                    go and I got there and I said, “You know, what happened?” He said, “You got me
                    into this mess and you're going with me.”</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>So he had with him, too, a member of the National Security Council, Rand Beers
                    and so there were the three of us. So I said to him, “What are you going to do?”
                    “We're going to get in the airplane; we're going to head east and are going to
                    figure out in the airplane what to do.” So we went up in the airplane and Bob
                    was thinking out loud and Bob was deciding, what do you want to have happen? We
                    are going in there, so he decided number one, to get a cease fire. Number two,
                    you try to make a connection with these people. Number three, you got to get
                    them to release the American prisoner they had, this army warrant officer and we
                    weren't sure we had all the American casualties accounted for and that sort of
                    thing, to get that sorted out. And then, get an agreement to start a process,
                    like a peaceful resolution process. So, you know, basically just to get things
                    done.</p>
                <p>So the first issue then became how do we contact Aidid? Bob decides we will land
                    in Ethiopia — Addis Ababa — and Eritrea, Asmara, because the Ethiopians and the
                    Eritreans have liaison with Aidid's people. They had a liaison team. So we use
                    that as communication. So we stopped there shortly, met with the Prime Minister
                    and President and they'd agreed if we contacted Aidid through their liaison and
                    we told them they we were coming in, we had a point of contact there and we
                    would set up a meeting and they would decide where to meet. They would not come
                    to any U.S. or UN facilities so we decided to meet at Bob Oakley's old sort of
                    compound. There were some Somalis sort of taking care of it. There were no
                    Americans because they had been pulled inside the wall. That would be the
                    meeting place and we would ensure that it was safe.</p>
                <p>We fly into Mogadishu and first stop at the airfield where the Somali people
                    were, who had suffered all these casualties. So we meet with them and we tried
                    to explain what our mission was. We wanted to be sure that if they see us
                    talking to Aidid what we're trying to do is get their prisoner out. We were
                    still trying to sort out if they had accounted for all the bodies. They had but
                    they didn't realize it. There was some confusion.</p>
                <p>General Garrison was really supportive, really felt the absolute need now that
                    this was the right thing to do, so we had no problem there. That was important
                    because that command was not under the UN or anything. That was a U.S. stovepipe
                    command, that special operations unit.</p>
                <p>So then we flew up to the old embassy where the UN was and we meet with Admiral
                    Howe. Howe did not like us being there. He did not want us there, he did not
                    approve of the mission. Aidid had declared a cease-fire; he would not declare a
                    cease-fire. He said, “I won't engage in any more offensive operations, I won't
                    start any, I'm not declaring a cease-fire. He is the enemy, I don't agree with
                    you being here, we shouldn't be talking to him.” So he and Oakley got into it a
                    little bit. Oakley had to explain to him, “read my lips,” because President
                    Clinton says. It was pretty tense there.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>So Oakley wanted me to go down and sort of work with the military. So I went down
                    to see General Bir and General Montgomery and it was a strange military
                    arrangement. Bier was the UN commander and Montgomery was his deputy in the UN
                    but Montgomery was also the commander of the U.S. forces which were not under UN
                    command. So really, within the UN structure you had two separate commands and
                    then you had the special ops guys, which was a third military command, and then
                    you had these two Marine amphibious units off the coast under a brigadier
                    general which is not under anybody's command there that were making noises, and
                    you had another joint force task force coming in which was another military
                    command. These were not together. There were five military commands on the
                    ground. One of the things Bob wanted me to do was make sure they understood we
                    were going to go out and meet with Aidid at this place and then meet with his
                    people initially, but we don't want any military operations going on. We want to
                    ensure that this is truly going to be a cease-fire, whether it was undeclared
                    but supported on one side and declared on the other side. So I went around to
                    make sure these were all shut down and I was shocked to see there were five
                    stovepipe military commands which didn't have much interaction with each
                    other.</p>
                <p>We went off to the first meeting. But Aidid decided not to come. We met with his
                    chief lieutenants. We were dropped off out of this place and they came and met
                    us there. We sat down and it was a really heated discussion. The UN had 80 some
                    of their people on an island in the south as prisoners. They had had reports
                    that these people were being mistreated, not bad, sick. We had promised to look
                    into that. It turned out there was some truth to all that. Some of their key
                    people, Osomanado, one of the chief lieutenants for Aidid and a number of others
                    were being held there. They wanted to negotiate a prisoner swap; we'll give you
                    one, we get our prisoners back. Oakley said, “No negotiating for prisoners. I'll
                    tell you right up front the president will not do that. You have to release one
                    officer to the command unconditionally.” So then they said, “Well,” they kind of
                    offered this wink and a nod. “We won't say it's conditionally but you promise us
                    you'll look into these matters” and he said, “I can't do that. I can't in good
                    faith say something because then it looks like and it becomes a negotiation for
                    prisoners. We can't do that.” He said, “All I can tell you is you have to
                    release one officer, adhere to the cease-fire. When those things are done we'll
                    meet again.” So and I'm sure this angered him because this was a back-and-forth
                    and they were calling their people and they finally left saying, “Okay. We'll
                    take it under consideration.”</p>
                <p>So, we waited and waited. Finally we get the callback. They will offer they will
                    release one officer and their first offer was to release them to Bob Oakley. Bob
                    said, “No, no.” They said they won't deal with the UN so he said, “You release
                    them to the Red Cross.” So we make the arrangements to release them to the Red
                    Cross. And so now you have this cease-fire declared by Aidid and now you have
                    Aidid going to give one officer to the Red Cross.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>We waited at the airfield for that announcement. We were sure that that was over.
                    Bob says, “Let's get out of here. We're going to give it time to settle. We're
                    going to let this happen. We want to focus on what's happening there. We don't
                    want to be visible in all this. Let this all take place and try to settle. It's
                    all positive information.” So we went back to Addis and a couple of other places
                    and Eritrea, sort of reported back to the president and the prime minister. He
                    communicated back to Washington and we then set up an agreement with Aidid to
                    come back and meet with him. The second meeting would be with Aidid. This would
                    be within a week or so, to give it some time to settle in, for the cease-fire to
                    take hold.</p>
                <p>We came back and now the arrangement was that we would be dropped in the center
                    of Mogadishu and there would be the three of us and Aidid's security people
                    would come and pick us up and they would take us to his hideout. So this was one
                    of these rides with all these technicals and guides through the streets and
                    driving at 90 miles an hour. We came to Aidid's headquarters and he is glad to
                    see us and he's embracing us. So we sat down and we started to talk about, you
                    know, reestablishing the relationship we had and upgrading this thing, getting a
                    cease-fire. Aidid basically agreed to all of it. The question became then the
                    status of Aidid because the UN had a $25,000 reward on his head. We had a very
                    emotional Congress and American population with our soldiers having been dragged
                    through the street.</p>
                <p>Aidid gave his side of the story how this all started and, I've got to tell you,
                    there was a lot that I saw though Intel and the facts and Aidid's side of the
                    story that this wasn't a deliberate ambush that started this all off. This was
                    an over-eager UN operation that broke into the radio station. Word went out on
                    the street that the radio station being shut down and attacked and they were
                    doing this inspection. They had actually killed a couple of people and then you
                    had this massive uprising of Aidid's clan, sort of spontaneous. Aidid made a big
                    mistake because once the spontaneity took over and they slaughtered these poor
                    Pakistani soldiers who were monitoring the station, they went up onto the road
                    as the Pakistani troops were coming out of the radio station and attacked them.
                    Aidid, instead of trying to calm everything down and say let's get this back to
                    order, he decides to take credit for all this. This was a mistake he made to
                    sort of pump his chest out and that just compounds the problem, one mistake
                    followed by another mistake, in my view.</p>
                <p>The number of civilians killed was appalling. On the Black Hawk Down thing there
                    were...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We lost 18 men or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: They killed about 300 militia but there was about another 800 or so
                    civilian casualties and that was backed up by the hospitals and actually our own
                    intelligence because I talked to senior intelligence officers out in
                    Somalia.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>This stuck in everybody's craw because Aidid was sort of left in limbo. There was
                    no decision. He was neither accepted with open arms and forgiven nor was he
                    pursued. On several of the meetings and such, he was actually moved by our
                    people to meeting sites and everything else and people got really upset about
                    it, so it was really a delicate situation. We came back the third time, the
                    three of us, and Bob had set up a set of meetings in Addis Ababa. He began this
                    sort of reconciliation and establishing all this, and Bob threw his heart and
                    soul into this and now he was going to restructure the political part of this.
                    My job in the coordination of the military was pretty much done so I bowed out
                    of this. Then I discover that the president has decided to leave in six months
                    and poor Bob has set up, has reestablished ourselves back to where we were, has
                    made these long-term sort of commitments and plans and the president has decided
                    to pull the chock with the U.S. forces. So Bob's whole effort had the rug pulled
                    out from under it, it seemed to me. He went there and did everything the
                    president asked, remarkably well and had put this process, the political process
                    and the security situation, back the way it was and there was no intention to
                    stop. I can understand that but Bob was not led to believe that. He was led to
                    believe that he could fix it.</p>
                <p>So I leave the scene. I now go to be commander of the First Marine Expeditionary
                    Force And the United Nations in 1995 decides it's had it with the mission. It's
                    pulling out. Now we are gone. We left after six months and the United Nations
                    comes to the United States and says, “We can't pull out on our own.” There were
                    intelligence threats of surface to air missiles, handheld, so they couldn't pull
                    out with their capability. They didn't have the amphibious capability to pull
                    out over the beach so they had this Pakistani brigade, this Bangladeshi
                    battalion and other odds and ends and their administrative staff. They were at
                    the port and airfield but they couldn't get out. They appealed to the United
                    States to withdraw and the Pentagon was just not up to this. General
                    Shalikashvili had been burned by this before; he didn't want to go back in but
                    they feel they have to do it. The president says we have to protect the UN. It's
                    obviously a Marine mission because you've got to withdraw them over the beach,
                    amphibious. You can't fly them out because they would be coming right up to the
                    planes and shooting them down out of the air.</p>
                <p>So the task of the First Marine Expeditionary Force is to be the combined joint
                    task force to run this operation. In 1995, we had plenty of time to plan, so we
                    planned it thoroughly. We went out on our ships. The Italians joined us, Italian
                    Marines, and we had some Pakistani ships and some odds and ends of, the Brits
                    provided a ship, but basically the forces on the ground were the Italian Marines
                    and the U.S. Marines and Special Forces, U.S. Army Special Forces.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>I went to Pakistan, Islamabad, to brief them because they were going to be the
                    last to land troops on the beach. We had worked out in a military context a
                    series of evolutions that are most difficult to perform. It was going to be a
                    passage of lines at night, there was going to be an amphibious withdrawal in the
                    middle of the night over the beach. I mean, these are the most difficult,
                    complex things you can do. There were like nine evolutions that had to take
                    place. In the military context these are the most complex things you could do.
                    The Pakistanis were very good, very professional so we get there. Dan Simpson is
                    now the U.S. representative with Somalia, the Oakley three times removed and we
                    go see Aidid and Ali Mahdi and others and basically, I was there to tell them we
                    were leaving. We don't want any trouble. Basically, we get concurrence from them
                    that they aren't going to cause any trouble. Everybody's kind of sad this whole
                    thing didn't work out but Aidid had said there are a lot of gangs that will not
                    let you go easily. I guarantee you it won't be my clan. It might be some of the
                    others. So we basically evacuate everything down, get the Pakistanis up. The UN
                    logistic system was just terrible. They send some rickety old ship to pick up
                    the Pakistanis. They had no food for them; the master of the ship was drunk so
                    we got all held up. I had to get food for the Pakistanis. The master the ship
                    got out. He almost ran aground which would have been disastrous. They had
                    contractors in there, they had crooks, they had their own gang.</p>
                <p>There was one contractor there that was a thug, he had these Khmer Rouge security
                    guys, and had threatened the United Nations forces on the way out and had the
                    military to deal with it. I had to go down and threaten him that if he caused
                    any trouble, I'd sink his ships and knock out his planes and all and finally had
                    him out of there.</p>
                <p>The withdrawal had been going fine but the last night at the beach we had to come
                    off in the middle of the night. We had these big berms around the beach, had two
                    companies of marines and some point come down and get in our tractors and go to
                    sea. In the course of the night, they just started to come in waves. They would
                    attack our positions and we would mow them down. They would attack our
                    positions, we would mow them down. We would try to broadcast, not to fire, not
                    to shoot. But it didn't matter. They were held back. So the night was really
                    heavy fire fights.</p>
                <p>We finally got to the point that everything was off the beach except the tractors
                    and we pulled back on signals, jumped in the tractors and were hoping we didn't
                    get a RPG in the back and we made it out to the sea. And of course, it was
                    midnight with heavy squalls and the tractor I'm on, catches on fire. So we start
                    to drift out to the beach, another tractor tries to take us in tow, that tractor
                    breaks down, so we go through this horrible night with all this stuff, trying to
                    transfer troops on the small Navy safety boats, overloaded, salvage the
                    tractors. So was about three o'clock in the morning when we got to the ship. We
                    did not lose a man. We did not take any casualties and got everybody back to the
                    ship and that was the last I saw of Somalia.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>In the course of that, some of the militia leaders wanted to see me. I had set up
                    at the airfield and they came in and these were guys I knew from all my past
                    times there. We met on a hill overlooking the airfield and it was kind of a
                    poignant moment because looking at all this, here's this airfield with all this
                    stuff. They were leaving all this logistics and stuff they had and it was just
                    being looted and they were just saying, “My God, all the money and effort that
                    went in, nothing out of this and nothing worth it.” And so we were kind of sad
                    about what had happened. But that was the end of it. We came off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you came off, what were your lessons? What stuck in
                        your mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: A couple of things. One, you can't conduct limited missions in a tsunami.
                    Once you intervene, you own the whole problem. It's sort of to paraphrase
                    Secretary Powell's the Pottery Barn, it's not a matter that you just break it;
                    if you touch it, you own it. If there was a metaphor for this the first days we
                    were there, the French had set up positions in Mogadishu down by the port and
                    they had a roadblock. They were stopping all the traffic because they wanted to
                    screen it because it went through their lines and all to make sure there were no
                    bad guys with guns. And a Somali bus came rumbling through, wouldn't stop for
                    the French security. The French security opened fire and they killed and wounded
                    a busload of people. We ended up taking these Somalis; there were some of them
                    very severely wounded. We brought them out to one of our ships, a big amphibious
                    ship that had an operating room and everything else because nothing else was
                    sure to take care of them. These were people in very unstable conditions. They
                    would be operated on and would be cared for. It came time for that ship to
                    rotate and we were going to rotate them out and the ship couldn't move because
                    we had these Somalis in there and the Somalis could not be transferred. There is
                    no place ashore for them. They were too unstable to be transferred to another
                    ship, so this big amphibious ship had to stay there until these Somalis were
                    stabilized which was weeks and weeks later. To me that was kind of a metaphor
                    for, “You touch it, you own it.” You took this poor traumatized society under
                    your wing and you thought you were just going to do a limited mission; you
                    can't, once you took them in.</p>
                <p>The second thing is we didn't have the doctrine and the coordination for this
                    kind of mission. There were a lot of disparate parts here. There was a political
                    element, a complex security element, you know, with all the coalition countries
                    and the Somalis, there was the humanitarian element and there were all sorts of
                    other elements; training police, reestablishing order, capacity building. We
                    didn't know how to do that, how to coordinate and pull all that together. We
                    were learning on the job. We were nation-building as much as we wanted not to be
                    in that business and we didn't know how to rebuild societies and restructure
                    nations, especially one in as bad shape as that was for so many reasons.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>The other lesson was culturally, we didn't understand the culture. We didn't
                    understand the Somalis. We didn't understand the clan system. I mean, Bob Oakley
                    did but he was rare. Some of the decisions that get made don't bring into
                    consideration the factors of culture, the factors of history. For example, we
                    had the Nigerians on the ground. We put the Nigerians out, sort of, in
                    positions. They were like magnets. They attracted every fire, every shooting
                    spree in town. I couldn't figure out why. Later I found out Siad Barre was in
                    next exile in Nigeria. They had granted exile so everybody was upset with the
                    Nigerians. We didn't know that.</p>
                <p>The Egyptians come in. The same thing happened to the Egyptians and it's because
                    there was this myth that Boutros Boutros-Ghali when he was deputy foreign
                    minister in Egypt had cut a deal with Siad Barre to transfer a million poor
                    Egyptians down to the Juba Valley, very rich, and settle them in there and take
                    out the Somalis and this myth about Egypt and everything else. Everybody
                    believed it.</p>
                <p>So you have these cultural and historical and political issues that you weren't
                    aware of, didn't get into your mix in terms of your intelligence. There were a
                    whole bunch of things like that that we didn't know that would have made you do
                    things differently had you understood them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Admiral Howe as often I have heard people talk about it
                        say he was the guy that got us into this. What was your impression of
                        Admiral Howe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: First of all, I liked him personally. He is a true American, a patriot.
                    Second of all, he's one of the most brilliant men I have ever met. You talk
                    about an intellect. I had served with him before and had great respect for him.
                    I think he was in a third world environment that he didn't understand and he
                    came in with a very noble objective in mind. I think he really saw that he was
                    going to eliminate the warlords and push to reestablish Somalia in some sort of
                    idealistic manner, where Oakley was a realist. You want stability; you want the
                    best you can get. Let's get it stabilized. Don't try to shoot for the moon and
                    create something that isn't going to be possible. The difference I saw from Howe
                    was a very American approach.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say it was very, very American.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Yes. In effect, we're going to get Iraqis Jeffersonian democracy. It was
                    well-intentioned. You cannot knock him for his enthusiasm, for his intellect or
                    his hard work, for his dedication. I just think he, from the first, didn't get
                    it. When we tried to explain it to him, he dismissed us in many ways. There was
                    some friction in that he wanted us to stay around. The combined task force was
                    called UNITAF. He wanted to keep UNITAF under the UN command, to be transferred
                    to him. What he didn't understand is that DOD and the secretary of defense and
                    the president wanted us out. They wanted to turn this back to the UN. They
                    didn't want this to be a U.S. mission and he, I think, blamed us for that.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Almost on a personal level, but here you were dealing with
                        the Clinton administration early on and there had been the problem of
                        Clinton avoiding service in Vietnam and his “Don't ask, don't tell” about
                        homosexuals and all in the service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: That was in the beginning and then of course, all the way through my
                    CENTCOM time to 2000. Although he didn't come in with much understanding of the
                    military, he was very interested in the military. He wanted to know about the
                    military. I briefed him on strikes in Iraq, I briefed him on a number of things
                    when I was CENTCOM and I always found he had this real thirst and curiosity for,
                    “Explain to me how this mission goes, explain to me what you are doing, why are
                    you doing that?” and very much in detail, not to micromanage but to understand.
                    The other thing that impressed me was he got it. He was a quick take.</p>
                <p>I think in Somalia two things happened with the administration. They were handed
                    this. They didn't get into this on their own. It was given to them. I think they
                    embraced it. I think they saw because, when they came in now in January, we were
                    doing good out there. You know, it was the CNN effect that got us in there. This
                    was Christiane Amanpour amongst the stick people and suddenly we are feeding
                    them. This was a good mission and it was done for all the right reasons by
                    President Bush. We had no political interest there we were protecting, no
                    political gain. He made this decision after he was defeated in the election and
                    I think the Clinton administration said this is kind of a signature thing of
                    that we want to do. This is great. We are going to use our power for good and
                    they embraced Somalia and I think in many ways didn't understand what they were
                    getting into. In many ways I think Boutros-Ghali trapped them into some things
                    that they may be any savvier or more experienced or maybe the Clinton
                    administration later on would have been more careful about. They saw all good in
                    this mission and when you were on the ground, you just saw that this was, as I
                    mentioned, was fragile but not only fragile, not only complex but had the
                    potential to go south. It was always a heartbeat away from things like
                    eventually happened. A miscalculation, a misunderstanding and we could have a
                    problem. So I think there was a degree of na�vet�, there was a degree of
                    idealism in their approach. There was a certain aspect of being driven by the
                    desire to want to use our power for good. I think he, if anything marked his
                    administration, it was this engagement and reaching out and this sort of fit the
                    mold. And he was burned by it and was burned by the experience. We all were. I
                    think later on, as he said, it affected his decision on Rwanda and Burundi and
                    he regretted that but the Somalian debt came in, Congress beat him up on it,
                    Aspin, secretary of defense, had to resign over it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were talking to Milosevic about Bosnia. The Serbs used
                        to sort of taunt some of our people by using Somalia saying that we couldn't
                        take casualties and therefore we wouldn't commit ourselves and I think, you
                        know this whole thing made it Vietnam tainted.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>ZINNI: It goes even deeper than that. Beirut, it's a, you know, the USS Cole gets
                    hit, we leave Yemen. The Khobar Towers gets bombed, we pull out of the eastern
                    provinces of Saudi Arabia. I mean, there are many examples where we take a lick
                    and the political decision is to immediately withdraw or desist. I think, my
                    personal view is, if it's one of those missions where we have been attacked or
                    we've clearly been wronged and the American people have a clear understanding of
                    why we are there, they will endure the casualties for the duration. In
                    Afghanistan the Americans will stay in Afghanistan as long as it takes because
                    it is Al Qaeda, it's the 9/11 perpetrators.</p>
                <p>When you get involved in something, let's take Somalia, the initial mission was
                    humanitarian. But suddenly the Americans wake up some months later and it has
                    shifted now to hunt the warlords and go into the streets and what's this about?
                    It went from a humanitarian mission to some sort of going after, anti-warlord,
                    in a remote part of the world. In Beirut, we had Marines sitting there with no
                    real purpose. Iraq, we go in on a premise that later is proven false, it's WMD
                    (weapons of mass destruction). I think people could misjudge the American
                    people. If the mission is clear to the American people and the mission is in a
                    sense where we have been wronged or we're clearly on the moral high ground and
                    it's vital to our interests, I think the American people will gut it out.
                    They're not going to gut it out on a vague missions or missions that are based
                    on false premises that are later discredited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This goes to World War II. The Japanese certainly, and the
                        Germans did too, felt we were too soft. Obviously it proved wrong.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>What was the feeling you are getting about Boutros Boutros-Ghali and the
                    leadership at the UN at this particular time?</p>
                <p>ZINNI: Terrible. Terrible reputation even dealing with his representative on the
                    ground he was very difficult to deal with. Oakley would go in there, we wanted a
                    restructured police force, we wanted UN help, and all you have to do is to
                    commit to do it. You know, reestablishing the police force, we will stay here,
                    and we will be part of it. They wouldn't touch it. They wouldn't do anything.
                    But they would dictate things like it would be, we will never take over the
                    police if there is a Somali in charge. That's why I became head of the police
                    force. Why not have a Somali in charge?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking as a former INR (Bureau of Intelligence and
                        Research) Horn of Africa analyst, this is back in the '60s, but the police
                        force was the one sort of major force that had a real reputation.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>ZINNI: And we had that. The Italians were willing to provide them with equipment,
                    uniforms, we had people who were willing to train them. We set this all up for
                    the UN. The other thing they would do is these ridiculous things like try to
                    tell us, we called ourselves “combined task force.” It had nothing to do with
                    the UN, that's a military term. A combined task force is a task force made up of
                    coalition countries. He said, “You can't use that term, combined task force.”
                    “We can't?” “No. You must call yourself “unified task force, UNITAF.” Well, you
                    know a lot of these things... But, we didn't want to do anything to upset the
                    apple cart because we wanted to get this thing passed over to the UN. So we
                    called ourselves UNITAF.</p>
                <p>There were these ridiculous dictates that would come out from him and
                    Boutros-Ghali. The UN forces were on the ground in April, early April. The UN
                    command element was there but they wouldn't take command. What we ended up with
                    is the most ridiculous situation in the world. Bob Johnston and his staff, we
                    had no more UNITAF forces, they were all gone. We commanded the UN forces. Their
                    staff was there but their staff would not take command. They were sitting next
                    to us. I had the UN operations officer next to me, he had the UN commander next
                    to him but they refused to take command. For six weeks our staff commanded the
                    UN forces and had the responsibility and I think had we not pushed the issue in
                    Washington, they were perfectly happy at that there. They were there to sort of
                    kibitz like advisers. We had no forces, yet we were commanding their forces. It
                    was the most ridiculous situation.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: It was Boutros-Ghali. And again a little bit of criticism of our own. I
                    don't know why we weren't in their face in New York on this stuff or calling for
                    a resolution on Chapter VII or something. We, maybe because the administration
                    was new, but Boutros-Ghali played us like a fine violin. He extracted the demand
                    for the U.S. military to provide the logistic support and command, to provide
                    the reaction force, the major reaction force. You know, he set all these
                    conditions out. If he hadn't finally exhausted the president's patience, he
                    would have continued on like that.</p>

                <p>ZINNI: No. President Bush came out. It was the last thing he did before the
                    inauguration. I can't think of in our time there any senior visitor. It might
                    have happened during UN time.</p>

                    Black Hawk Down thing, he was out there the next day. We met with him. When we
                    landed at the airport he was already there. He was with the special ops
                    guys.</p>
                <p>We saw dignitaries from the different units. We even had Kraus, who was the NATO
                    military committee head came down. Why? There weren't any German troops there.
                    The only NATO were the French and Canadian but he came down to visit. We had
                    everything from presidents to senior officials from some of contributing
                    countries that came down.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in 1995 and then what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Yes. And of course we had a commitment in Korea, and a commitment in
                    CENTCOM for Iraq and Iran, so my time was spent staying boned up on those war
                    plans, going through those sorts of things.</p>
                <p>I was nominated to be the deputy commander in chief of CENTCOM, the number two at
                    CENTCOM. So in 1996 I went to CENTCOM and spent a year as the deputy and then I
                    was nominated to be the commander and became the commander in 1997 until
                    2000.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, while you were with the Marine expeditionary force,
                        Korea. I was in Korea twice, once during the war and once 1976 until 1979
                        and you know, we were very aware of the problems of the Korean Peninsula.
                        What did you see your role as the situation was, vis-�-vis Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Well, our mission there was, I commanded the Marine operational forces for
                    any Korean military operation or military mission. So we would go over there
                    several times a year to go through extensive exercises in training and that sort
                    of thing and so I spent a lot of time in Korea. When I was in Okinawa, I would
                    take my regiment there for the Team Spirit exercises. When I was commander of
                    the First Marine Expeditionary Force, we did the exercises. There were
                    extensive, lengthy exercises on exercising different options on how we would
                    execute the war plan for Korea. I knew many of the Koreans. First of all,
                    there's a big Korean presence in our school and, of course, military to military
                    relations and I knew a lot of Korean marine officers very well. So we were
                    really well-connected and really well steeped in the whole potential war
                    fighting of this thing and by the constant time spent over there we got to know
                    the Koreans and their situation very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Korean military?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>ZINNI: Excellent. I would tell you there is no doubt about their courage, their
                    toughness and willingness to fight. There's obvious things that compared to our
                    military, sometimes logistics, fire support, planning and those sorts of things
                    obviously, they were not in the league certainly with ours, but in terms of
                    tough units, willing to fight, knowing what they have to do, executing. In the
                    scheme of things I had Korean units under my command, Korean divisions, Army and
                    Marines and they were superb. Their officers were all trained mostly in the
                    United States; they basically had our doctrine and understood our war fighting
                    system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the how, and we're talking
                        about the time you were there, had this, how our war mind developed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Well, there were all sorts of reasons a war could start. It could be a
                    miscalculation, there could be some sort of a situation in Korea where they sort
                    of became trapped and desperate and needing to do something, or their economy is
                    collapsing and control is collapsing. There were all sorts of scenarios for
                    starting. From a military point of view, you didn't care how it started. It
                    would've been very difficult, especially in the wrong times of the year where
                    you have climate working against our obvious advantage in airpower and other
                    things. You have the Koreans dug in into the hills and into the mountains so
                    they're very hard targets to get at. This vast array of artillery, rockets and
                    other missiles that they have lined up. You have a situation where Seoul and the
                    environs of Seoul have 25% of the Korean people in them. That's about 11 million
                    packed up right up against an artillery and rocket range. So it's not like you
                    have a distance or sort of a battlefield. You have the capital of South Korea
                    plus a huge percent of its population plus a lot of Americans right under the
                    gun. If the war started as a surprise, it would be very vulnerable. As you move
                    into place it becomes a rapid deployment to try to make sure you can close the
                    space and time. You're going to have to evacuate civilians. Seoul could be
                    devastated. If it's the wrong time of the year you're fighting up in those
                    hills. That's Korean War vintage slogging infantry war. It's not a place where
                    armored units initially can operate. And then the wrong kind of weather, the
                    digging in of their capabilities, the use of WMD, all compounded make it a very
                    difficult situation. There's no doubt in the end that we would prevail but it
                    would be difficult, bloody and it would take some time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well CENTCOM, you were in CENTCOM both as deputy and the
                        commander from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: '96 to 1997 as the deputy. '97 until 2000 as the commander.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk a bit about at that time how was CENTCOM seen as an
                        instrument.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>ZINNI: Well, it was interesting because when I was in European Command when the
                    Soviet Union collapsed, people were talking about disbanding CENTCOM and CENTCOM
                    was going to become a sleepy little backwater. I mean, Carter had created it to
                    protect against Soviet incursion through the Zaragoza Mountains and then that
                    all went away. It looked like CENTCOM might be a joint task force, sort of a
                    unified command. Well, the Gulf War changed all that and now CENTCOM became the
                    sort of centerpiece for potential military action. We had the two major theaters
                    of war, the 2 MTW strategy that the military was programmed and shaped around
                    this sort of notional ability to fight two wars. And the two wars were Iraq and
                    Korea and in CENTCOM you had two threats. You were in the era of the dual
                    containment policy that Iran and Iraq both pose a threat. So when I got there
                    the principal sort of threat and everything that the delivered planning is
                    geared against was at Iraq and Iran and the containment of Iraq and Iran and the
                    preparation to go right into major conflict with either one. Then beside that,
                    you had the terrorist extremist threat which was alive and well. I mean, I got
                    there right after Khobar Towers so that was a problem. Security force protection
                    was a big issue. Then you had all sorts of humanitarian problems, peacekeeping
                    problems in the Horn of Africa and elsewhere.</p>
                <p>We opened up Central Asia and that came under CENTCOM's area of responsibility
                    while I was there so it was a whole another area and region. We had Pakistan and
                    India. We had the Israeli Arab conflict, although Israel wasn't in CENTCOM's
                    area during my time. And I had Pakistan and not India and so, I mean, this was
                    rich in crisis and potential large-scale conflicts and that sort of was the mood
                    out there. Since I had previously worked in European Command and then Pacific
                    Command, you know, now coming here, I was now immersed in day-to-day crises. You
                    didn't go to sleep at night. The Iranian patrol boats would ram our ships. I'm
                    amazed that our captain of the ship didn't blow somebody out of the water. We
                    were worried about a terrorist attack, we didn't know if Saddam or Rafsanjani or
                    somebody would end up doing something that would be unacceptable and we would
                    launch into something more significant. We had all the problems in Africa. We
                    were running humanitarian missions and operations and other things in Africa. We
                    had emerging countries like Yemen and Central Asia that we were beginning
                    relationships with, that were really in bad shape and we couldn't really get the
                    right kind of policy decisions out of the administration. We were trying to
                    build military to military relationships. I mean in the Seychelles Islands,
                    every nation out there, the entire time I was there, was on a high terrorist
                    threat level. So I mean, it was an interesting environment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you have to use?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>ZINNI: Well, everything from, and we had this sort of loose coalition. I mean,
                    unlike NATO or SEATO or something like that, we always advertised this Gulf
                    Coalition, that was the term. There was no coalition. There was just an informal
                    relationship based on our bilateral setups with the GCC countries, Gulf
                    Cooperation Council and Jordan and Egypt. These required constant maintenance.
                    We had, you know, a forward presence out there. It was very difficult for them
                    to sell on their own street. It was even difficult back here, although I think
                    we did it on the cheap. We did it with less troops. These are rotational units.
                    We didn't own any bases out there; we didn't have any force structure dedicated
                    to CENTCOM. These were rotated to medic commands so I had to constantly be out
                    there. I spent over 70% of my time out there in the region although my
                    headquarters was in Tampa, Florida.</p>
                <p>Everything is based on personality out there, so you had to build these personal
                    relationships, you had to maintain them. There was always crises at every level,
                    some of them relatively minor but you had to deal with every one of them. It's
                    obviously a very different culture from Europe and Asia and we're not used to
                    operating in that culture. I liked the hell out of it. I enjoyed it. I just
                    liked the people, I liked the sense of mission. Every day was a new challenge or
                    adventure out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that we were drifting apart from the
                        Saudis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Not in my time. As a matter fact we were under difficult situations
                    because, you know, our presence out there was a hard sell for them on their own
                    street. We did everything to remain as invisible as we could. We did everything
                    to work with them, to try to work on a positive image. It's not the kind of
                    relationship like a NATO relationship, where you create a document and then it
                    runs on its own steam and the relationship is going to be automatic because of
                    basically some cultural affinity. You have to be constantly working. It's
                    something you can't assume anything. You're either going up or you're going
                    down. You're not going to just retain some sort of status quo without working.
                    We had great ambassadors out there. The military and State relationships out
                    there were superb from my point of view. I think they would have said the same
                    thing. We tried to be mutually supportive of each other. I think one of the
                    things that made it work in my time was that I had the kind of relationship and
                    support from the bureaus back in State. I mean, part of the problem is that
                    State's geography is different than ours. I had four regional bureaus that I
                    worked with but none of them were obviously all encompassed in my AOR (area of
                    responsibility) and I wasn't all encompassed in theirs. They lapped over and it
                    made it a little difficult to align priorities and policies but we made it
                    work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about blowing up our embassies in Nairobi
                        and Dar es Salaam?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>ZINNI: In 1998 Osama bin Laden issued a series of fatwas. For us in there, they
                    were watching him pretty closely. It was clear to our intelligence people that
                    this was his coming out party and he was announcing that all Americans were
                    targets, not just military. He announced he had the right to a weapon of mass
                    destruction. He was setting the stage for, I think he had finally jelled this
                    network together and he was now making the announcement that he was coming onto
                    the world scene. The first, of course, major act we end up with is the bombing
                    of the two embassies. Of course, Kenya was in our area of responsibility and the
                    one in Tanzania in EUCOM's AOR.</p>
                <p>The Nairobi bombing occurs and I immediately sent a team down there to take
                    charge, to set up a joint task force, provide military support, medical,
                    engineering support, security. We had a magnificent ambassador there, Prudence
                    Bushnell. She was wounded. I went down there. You know, the Kenyans blamed the
                    Americans. You know, it was not easy for her to see this Embassy blown up and
                    she was personally wounded and she carried on like a Marine. I have tremendous
                    respect for her.</p>
                <p>They set up the embassy in the only place they had available which was in the
                    middle of this, you know, cluster of buildings in the middle of Nairobi, a
                    really terrible situation in terms of the security. We had a company of Marines
                    in there and found that among the Joint Chiefs of Staff in the Pentagon many
                    would bail out on this thing. You know, they kept arguing that this was State's
                    responsibility. We went and took care of the emergency part. I kept coming back
                    saying, “You can't leave these Americans. You can't leave them.” I lost one of
                    my troops killed in that embassy bombing, a security assistance sergeant, Air
                    Force, and you know, you have to be there. You're going to take time for them to
                    find another property to buy, to make sure the security arrangements are in
                    place and we had to provide protection. I put my foot down. I mean, this was a,
                    you know, “fire me but we're going to stay there and stop making an issue out of
                    this.” So finally they didn't fight me on it, although they were really tough.
                    They really chipped away at me.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>The other thing that is hard to talk about, six months before the bombing, I sent
                    a personal forward message to the Secretary of State saying we have two
                    embassies in my AOR that are going to be blown up by a car bomb. One of them is
                    Nairobi, the other one is Qatar and I said I'm willing to help with a security
                    assessment and willing to help in any way I can. These are vulnerable embassies
                    and I said that because both ambassadors had come to me because they weren't
                    getting any answers. Basically, I got a message back saying butt out. It is not
                    your business. Thank you for your interest, but sorry. The only two embassies
                    and of course, I had security assistance people in those embassies. There were
                    obviously Marine security guards and attach�s but my own people and Prudence and
                    at the time Pat Theros was in Qatar. Those two embassies were a security
                    assessment nightmare, right on the streets, very vulnerable. And they kept
                    coming back saying well, the Intel says there is no threat. You know, the threat
                    is going to go where the vulnerability is. We hardened everything else in the
                    region and I couldn't get their attention. I didn't say anything about it after
                    the bombing. A reporter had gotten it and State just sort of dismissed it. But I
                    sent the message.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Prudence Bushnell noted that she had been talking about
                        this for a long time and got nowhere. Everyone talked about what a great
                        heroine she was, she said, “Where were you when I needed you?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: And she was the one who had asked me. So I sent the message.</p>
                <p>It hurt our relationships in Kenya, you know, but the military to military
                    relationship always stayed strong. The difficulty became in the region, you
                    know, I felt it important for security reasons to keep strong military to
                    military relationship but you take the countries like Pakistan and Kenya, where
                    non-proliferation, human rights, issues with the government and everything else,
                    it punished the military. I would get restricted in places where we had
                    excellent contacts like General [inaudible] in Kenya, we knew from our own
                    intelligence had cleaned up the military, had gotten rid of the corruption. The
                    military was clean, he was doing everything right, no abuses in military and I
                    would be limited in what I can do with him because of Moi's administration.
                    Thompson would come to me out of frustration and say, why are you punishing me?
                    We what you want me to do? March to the palace and takeover of government? Is
                    that what you advocate?</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>In the same way out in Pakistan, when we had Kalimat as the commander of the
                    military, trained in the United States. I mean, the Pakistani military,
                    important to keep them in the fold, keep them educated here. Everything came
                    down to breaking the military to military relationship. Then when we needed
                    them, like when the Jordanians discovered the Y2K (year 2000) plot to blow up
                    American targets over the turn of the millennium, tourist targets, and they
                    fingered the leadership coming out of Peshawar and all, then they wanted me to
                    go to Musharraf and ask him to arrest them, to provide the discs they had
                    confiscated. You could not defend that. And we blew them off. Certainly after
                    9/11 when we go running to embrace them then, their people said screw them. I
                    mean, they're the ones who left us high and dry after the first Afghan war with
                    500,000 refugees. They're the ones that we bought F-16s, they kept our money and
                    the planes while our pilots were flying obsolete planes and crashing. They're
                    the ones that because we responded to an Indian test and tested one of our own
                    weapons of mass destruction, I mean, rightly or wrongly, on the street it made
                    it difficult for Western leaning people like Musharraf and his predecessor to
                    stay connected to us without worrying about how it's going to be received on the
                    street. And today it's an even bigger problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were there how did we view Iran?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Well, it's interesting. When I first got there we really saw Iran as maybe
                    not an immediate threat like Iraq but we saw it as long-term threat. We saw it
                    as a hostile regime. The actions, like I said, day to day in the Gulf were
                    really bad. There were all sorts of incidents. The relationship was very, very
                    tense and hostile. Then Khatami gets elected president and all of a sudden there
                    is a change in mood and attitude. All of the ship incidents stopped. The bridge
                    to bridge communications become professional and we noticed this whole change of
                    attitude, not that they were reaching out to us but it just becomes normal.</p>
                <p>I told President Clinton this and at the same time obviously, the Clinton
                    Administration was wrestling with what does Khatami's election mean? The
                    president said, “Is there anything we can do?” and he wanted to look in all
                    areas to sort of test the waters. We can't go too far on this but can we test
                    the waters? Can we reach out but not in a way that would looks like we are
                    coming after them or goes too far to sort of evoke a response? And of course,
                    State dropped the restrictions on pistachio nuts, and Persian carpets, and we
                    sent some wrestling teams over there. I took it seriously to say what could we
                    do on the military side? We looked at it and we offered some things that were
                    never really adopted but that we could offer a program of cooperative search and
                    rescue. In other words, if there is a fisherman or one of our sailors we want to
                    work together. You know, there were several things we could do in, like, an oil
                    spill in the Gulf, we could work together; certain things that were innocuous
                    and humanitarian in nature could be a reach out but not in reaching too far and
                    the president liked it. Eventually, he wanted to build a measure to all these
                    sorts of things that could be done. The initial gestures never really seemed to
                    go anywhere. It didn't seem to change the attitude in my time there but they
                    never really seemed to take hold.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>In the meantime, the reformists were really beginning to gain some traction
                    there. They were really beginning to feel their oats and more and more, the
                    hardliners are having to give in. A little more freedom in education, academic
                    freedom, freedom of the press and it looked like it might be going somewhere but
                    then I think Khatami turned out to be a big disappointment to everybody. It
                    couldn't go that far. The hardliners kind of pulled back. So by the time I left
                    in 2000, I would say we were still in a containment policy in Iran. It seemed to
                    me the hostility and the tension levels had been greatly reduced. We sort of
                    agreed to disagree, you know, but not in a way of creating any significant
                    battles from a military point of view. And Iraq was fully contained. I was more
                    worried about Iraq imploding and collapsing than I was about some sort of
                    hostile act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Iraq? Was there much pressure in the United
                        States, well, from your intelligence? Political-wise, in the United States
                        were we looking at Iraq as being anything other than just a problem that was
                        contained?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Well, I think we let ourselves believe he had an ongoing weapons of mass
                    destruction program and I believed that in the beginning because the Intel
                    people kept saying that until 1998, when the inspectors came out, Richard
                    Butler, and President Clinton says we'll do a military strike to remove the WMD
                    program. And I said fine. But when I looked at the targets I got, there were no
                    WMD targets. They were targets that would hit things that would support a WMD
                    program like the Toji missile facility but he was allowed to have the short
                    range missiles or use facilities or special republican guards that used to be
                    keepers of the security. But when I looked at it I said, “You know, I go up on
                    the Hill and testify every year” and I say, “This guy has a WMD program and this
                    guy is dangerous” because I'm told that, but now when punch time comes and
                    produce me a damn target, it isn't there. I mean, I began then to have serious
                    doubts about an existing WMD program.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>Now, I didn't discount the fact that, you know, not everything you used to have
                    is accounted for. There could still be some artillery gas around or docking
                    grounds or SCUDs or something but over time those things become less valuable.
                    Obviously, if he still has the scientists, he could start a program. Toward the
                    end of my time I just began to believe, like in last year of my time, this guy
                    is no threat. What began to worry me is this guy could collapse. You know, this
                    country could go into chaos. And what scared me is no matter how we got into
                    Iraq, whether he did something to cause us to react or he collapsed and we had
                    to go in, because it would generate all the problems, we would really be in
                    trouble. I asked during an interagency conference, we did a war game which is to
                    look at scenarios if we went in under any conditions. It was called Desert
                    Crossing. We did it up here at Booz Allen Hamilton. I had an INR assistant
                    secretary level, I had DOD, the CIA, everybody we can think of that might have a
                    role. Remarkably, they predicted everything that happened. If you went in there
                    this place would fragment, come apart, that you had better go in with sufficient
                    troops to secure the borders, to control the population. You're going to have
                    problems with ethnic cleansing and retribution. You're going to have floods of
                    people coming across the border from Iran, Syria and outside, the Al Qaeda, the
                    supporters, the Shia groups, you're going to have, you're going to have these
                    humanitarian problems, an exodus of refugees and brain drain. This was all
                    predicted. And what scared me, if my war plan didn't account for any of that
                    other than we had planned on the numbers of troops being up to 400,000 to go in,
                    which we felt were needed, so I was in complete shock after I retired when
                    Rumsfeld decides to go in on the cheap and believe this is a liberation. When
                    they start talking about flowers in the street, I was almost as shocked as when
                    I was heard this WMD, mushroom clouds, grave threat. I was doing work for the
                    CIA after I retired and I saw the intelligence right up to the day of the war
                    and I didn't see any of that in there. Just the opposite.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Afghanistan? Did we just write this off?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Yes, I think in my time there if I had to look back and see something we
                    should have done better, we never put pressure on the Taliban and Al Qaeda in
                    Afghanistan. They got a free ride and sanctuary. We blew up any consideration of
                    supporting the northern alliance until after 9/11 or, at least encouraging them
                    or supporting them in some way. It was difficult to get support for places like
                    Uzbekistan that was a major drug route for Al Qaeda and Taliban were using them
                    to move the drugs through. And they were running their own operation, the
                    Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan and others. We didn't, we weren't giving enough
                    support to make them worry about their own backyard.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>I think at the time there was hope that we could convince the Taliban to expel Al
                    Qaeda or come around. Remember, Bill Richardson went and the Saudis were making
                    offers, we were going there and trying to talk to them. I think there was still
                    a belief that at that time that the Taliban could be either pressured or brought
                    around or cajoled to clean up Al Qaeda. That probably was na�ve. We probably
                    shouldn't have done that. We didn't even have a war plan for Afghanistan. You
                    could direct it with war plans but in retrospect, it was a free ride. It was a
                    sanctuary with a free ride. Maybe na�vely hoping that somehow the Taliban would
                    come around. We should have realized the Taliban was not going to come around.
                    We needed to do something about it. But you know, we were focused on Iran and
                    Iraq and Korea and other things, Kosovo and everything else that was going on.
                    The Nairobi bombings were somewhat of a wake-up call, Nairobi, Dar es Salaam,
                    but still, you know, it wasn't anything that people had to, were thinking
                    through. After the embassy bombings when the president wanted to find targets
                    for Al Qaeda, and we shot those targets, we shot those camps, there was a 50-50
                    chance you might have civilians in that camp. It looked stupid. You destroyed a
                    bunch of jungle gyms so it was worth a shot. We could not not take the shot. And
                    then the CIA came up with these targets in Khartoum which I didn't
                    understand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They blew up an aspirin factory.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Yes and there were more targets. We got rid of the other ones. They wanted
                    me to shoot this one and I shot it because, you know, at one time twice removed
                    it seemingly supported some program. And that made us look even worse. That one
                    I never understood. It wasn't even on my target list. It was a surprise to
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This brings up a question. Maybe I'm treading on the wrong
                        ground. When you get to intelligence, one is not overly impressed by the
                        intelligence that we get. I mean, the major one being of course the Soviet
                        Union collapse and we had spent billions of dollars closely examining this.
                        We didn't pick that up. The other examples, we just get it wrong.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>ZINNI: What I learned at CENTCOM because I had two great intelligence officers,
                    they were phenomenal. I found that most of the intelligence they gave me, 80%,
                    was from open sources. I would go to Bob Newman and say, “Bob, answer this
                    question for me.” And I would give him a question he would answer the question.
                    He would always say, “Why are you asking the question?” I would always say,
                    “What you mean, why?” “Because I need to know what you're going to do with the
                    information to make sure you understand it, not out of context.” Then he would
                    tell me you're not going to do anything stupid, you know. You know, that's the
                    kind of intelligence person you want. If George Tenet said to the president,
                    “Why are you asking me this question, what are you going to do with it, are you
                    going to use it as a justification for war?” I've got to tell you, it's shaky. I
                    mean, because it was shaky. Curve ball and yellow cake and all this stuff,
                    aluminum tubes all of this turned out to be hokum. That's the first part. It's
                    not so much the intelligence; it's somebody who has made up their mind to take
                    an action and they're just looking for justification for the action. Then you
                    can cherry pick what you want. Intelligence officers have to be brought into the
                    decision-making and understand the context to be more effective in what they
                    present. That's the first issue.</p>
                <p>The second issue is it is true we don't have the human network, we don't
                    understand. We see things very well. I could see Saddam doing things. I can see,
                    you know, he had these little science projects he would work on, he would move
                    units here, he would do this. I didn't know the meaning of those things. I
                    didn't know what he was doing. You had no sense of why these things were
                    occurring, what the intent behind them was. We can do a lot to gather what I
                    call order of battle intelligence. I can tell you where the Hammurabi Division
                    is on a given day but why is it there is it there? So intelligence isn't
                    perfect.</p>
                <p>The third point about intelligence is this terrible term, “actionable
                    intelligence.” It also almost means that the intelligence in and of itself
                    predetermines the action. Actions are political and operational decisions. You
                    know, you get a piece of intelligence. The action isn't you know, tied directly
                    to the intelligence. It is an operational political decision you do based on the
                    intelligence. When you begin to believe the intelligence person delivers you the
                    course of action, that's when you get into trouble because there are too many
                    other factors that go into that. I guess what I'm trying to say, part of it is a
                    lack of certain capabilities we have within the intelligence but much of it is
                    understanding how to use the intelligence. And much of it in the intelligence
                    side is about how to present it and you won't know how to present it unless you
                    understand what this guy is going to do with it, what's his intention, what's he
                    want to use it for, what's he got going on in his head.</p>
                <p>I had these two sort of irreverent generals that weren't afraid to get in my face
                    and say “what I give you, I've got to understand how you're going to use it.
                    I've got to caution you about things or put it in the right context or maybe add
                    other things in you haven't asked about that impact on that decision.” So if you
                    don't have that confidence in that interchange then just getting intelligence
                    doesn't serve you well no matter how good it is.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there's another factor that seems to get in and that
                        is conventional wisdom, that once we get into a mold, as with the Soviet
                        Union, that this is a very strong centralized government, which in a way was
                        true but we didn't see it ever ending. You know, I mean, conventional wisdom
                        just draws a straight line.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Yes, that's the other point. Don't just get yourself involved in
                    containment for containment's sake and then surprise yourself when the
                    containment works. You know, we have contained North Korea, Cuba, the Soviet
                    Union, Iraq until the Iraq War and now Iran for how many years? Well, at some
                    point in time if you do it right, the containment works. But then you've got to
                    understand what does “works” mean? What happens when the North Korean economy
                    goes finally completely bust and they're really on the rocks? Are they going to
                    be trapped rats and strike out? Is somebody communicating the golden parachute
                    and a way out for them? Is it going to be some sort of soft landing you can
                    orchestrate?</p>
                <p>And then the intel has to be keen to perceive when they're heading in that
                    direction. You know, everybody is going through the scenarios in a post-Fidel
                    Cuba. Well, what does it mean? What's going to happen? How's the change going to
                    come about? Are there going to be Cubans rushing for Florida or Cubans in
                    Florida rushing for Cuba? How is this going to go down? You can't just decide in
                    the huddle. I was in Europe when the Soviet Union collapsed. General Galvin had
                    a plan: immediately engage with militaries on the other side, immediately create
                    this military to military relationship, immediately tell them, don't snap this
                    back, you know, this is the chance. Go over there, he told us, not as conquerors
                    and winners but as brothers and tell them your people won this and let's work
                    together.</p>
                <p>Baker had a plan and sent Armitage out there. I worked with Armitage, as I told
                    you, on Provide Hope to try to do something along the lines of a Marshall Plan.
                    But he could never get it off the ground. But I was shocked at how unprepared we
                    were for all this. Everything we said would happen happened. And then we were
                    shocked.</p>
                <p>What happens if Iraq collapses or North Korea collapses or even in Iran? What
                    happens if the reformers get stirred up in Iran and things begin to happen and
                    they challenge the regime? What's our role in that? I don't think we've answered
                    those questions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You retired in 2000. All hell broke loose again and you
                        have played sort of a role of one of the, I have to say, many critics, of
                        how things were done. How did you view this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>ZINNI: Well, I did some work for the State Department after I retired. I became
                    in effect the envoy for the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. I was sent to
                    Indonesia to work with the Free Aceh Movement and the government in Indonesia,
                    and to the Philippines to work with the Moro Islamic Liberation Front and the
                    government of President Arroyo. That taught me a lot about this whole idea of
                    the war on terrorism and everything else that was going on. It wasn't just a war
                    in the military context; it was going to be for the hearts and minds of these
                    young people, these groups that had issues with their governments and how are we
                    going to take it down? It struck me we had to stay completely focused on Al
                    Qaeda initially and we also had to be focused on, obviously, we will eliminate
                    the Taliban in Afghanistan so Afghanistan has to be tomorrow. Afghanistan, you
                    have to fully concentrate your resources and your attention on Afghanistan. The
                    advantages are the world is with you, we have just been attacked so today
                    everybody's American. You have popular support, you have moral justification,
                    you're focused, you luck out and get Karzai, a charismatic leader who looks
                    good, sounds good. You've got an Afghanistan that looks reasonably
                    reconstructable in some manner. You've got to stay totally focused on there. The
                    opportunities now and the conditions mean you can reach out to the Pakistanis
                    and others. Maybe if you have other issues you can take away some of the
                    political restrictions and reopen a dialogue and encourage that. You have a
                    tense situation in the Gulf because many those bombers in 9/11 came from there
                    so you're going to have to work seriously to make sure those relationships don't
                    go south on you and you should building them. You're going to have to do a lot
                    to communicate to the American people and I think the president at the beginning
                    did. He said, “This is not a Muslim-Christian issue.” He said all the right
                    things so in the beginning, it looked good. I mean, it looked like we were on
                    the right track. I also thought the peace mediation work that I was doing here
                    now was helpful because I'm dealing with Muslims in all three scenarios. Some of
                    these groups were on the edge and could easily get on the terrorist list. They
                    are fighting within their own groups between the young people who want to go to
                    Osama bin Laden and the older people who say no, this is an issue of us with
                    issues with the state. Now we can wean them away from Osama bin Laden and Jamal
                    Islamia and all these other groups who are trying to grab them. And I thought
                    there is your strategy. The strategy is the hearts and minds of the young
                    people. Every young man, when their anger is caused by political, economic or
                    social conditions, are ripe meat for Osama bin Ladens of the world who preach a
                    radical form of Islam as a rationale for doing what they do. So you've got to
                    work to take away the anger. You've got to work on all these fronts; the
                    diplomatic front, the economic front, the social front, and to a certain degree,
                    the military and take it in a very measured way.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>So when all of a sudden I start I seeing the war going deeper, I say, “What are
                    we doing? This guy, Saddam, is not part of the problem. He's contained.” Why
                    would you want to distract yourself, why would you want to get into a
                    controversial conflict, why would you want to immerse yourself in a situation
                    which is going to drag you into a real black hole? Because, you know, I had
                    looked at all this post-conflict, post-Saddam environment and then to hear the
                    way they were going to do it with too few troops, with this na�ve belief that
                    this was a liberation, with this neocon philosophy that the road to Jerusalem
                    led to Baghdad and this was constructive destabilization. Some of the terms they
                    were using were ridiculous. I couldn't believe it. I couldn't believe we have
                    gone over the edge that far. What was happening to the president? He may be
                    inexperienced, I understand, but Dick Cheney? I know how Colin felt, I think I
                    know he thought this was a bad idea and going about it in the wrong way and he
                    was trying to provide sanity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A real puzzlement is Paul Wolfowitz.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: A neocon leader.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had a pretty good reputation before in Indonesia and
                        elsewhere dealing with things, was what I picked up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: We just experienced the worst secretary of defense in our history. He not
                    only failed as, in directing and conducting the war in every respect, he never
                    made any adjustments within the military. He claimed it was going to be a long
                    war. Prior to this his vision of transformation was to cut the Army 56,000
                    troops, reduce ground forces. In four years he never increased the ground forces
                    to fight this war. You know, its transformation philosophy was completely wrong.
                    His war fighting capability was completely flawed. His leadership style was
                    horrible. His whole philosophy of resource management and acquisition, where he
                    was supposed to be a superstar, we didn't cut any programs. Basically it's been
                    off the page. We couldn't support the troops and supply them. I watched the
                    wheels come off this administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you picked up any of this before? Obviously, you had
                        very good connections right after you retired to the existing command thing
                        and the new administration came in prior to 9/11.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: The only piece I was picking up was, again, the neocons getting ensconced
                    in the Department of Defense. Noises were starting to come out, they had their
                    own agenda and I ran afoul of the neocons in my time in CENTCOM because I
                    opposed the Iraqi invasion and the neocons really took me on. I was their arch
                    enemy. My POLAD (Political Advisor) was Larry Pope.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Larry Pope was not confirmed as an ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Right. And again, the neocons undermined it, with Jesse Helms. I watched
                    this crowd get themselves well positioned. They came in with Wolfowitz and
                    Richard Burr and Douglas Viper, this whole crew. It's clear to me and I'm
                    hearing from the Pentagon their visions of transformation. They have always
                    wanted to get into this business in Iraq, meddle in Iraq and bring their boys a
                    solid regime and so before I was hearing they were trying to push this even
                    before 9/11.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up while you were at CENTCOM what about
                        Chalabi and that crew? Were they these Iraqi dissidents, I mean outsiders,
                        were they a factor at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Well, they were running around town here telling everybody, give me the
                    money and I'll go in and start this revolution from the inside, put CENTCOM
                    under my command, make them give me special forces and air support. There are
                    people signing up to it in Congress. Believe me, this was in that wonderful
                    silent song that how you could do something on the cheap, which was ridiculous.
                    Every leader in the region was telling you, how could you guys work with this
                    guy? He was wanted on an arrest warrant in Jordan, the Petra Bank scam. He had
                    some issue in Lebanon, another one in Saudi Arabia. I mean, he was seen as a
                    scam artist out there in that part of the world. And the stuff he was pushing
                    and his people were slipping a war plan promoting him in Congress was floating
                    around. Had a retired general working with him. I mean, I was in CENTCOM for
                    NATO. I knew the war planning and they are doing it in Congress, staffers are
                    doing it in Congress. I mean, this was ridiculous. And so when they got all of
                    that they resented it. I got on their enemies list.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were out, did you find yourself involved? I don't
                        know if, you shouldn't call them loyal opposition, but an opposition force
                        around the Iraq War? Did you find yourself getting involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>ZINNI: Yes. There were a lot of retired officers, you know, senior officers who
                    couldn't believe this, especially the way we were going to do it. The last four
                    commanders of CENTCOM, myself, General Peay, General Hoar, General Schwarzkopf
                    all publicly, you know, cautioned against this. And going against it they had
                    concerns about the way they walked away from 10 years worth of planning and
                    altered troop numbers that would be in their plan. And then to watch in horror
                    the performance of the CPA (Coalition provisional Authority) and Bremer. We had
                    spent years on this program of sending messages to the Iraqi regular army that
                    the time comes, you don't play with that carrier. He just axed them. We knew
                    that you had to do a reconciliation not a debaathificaiton. They closed — 50% of
                    the paychecks were paid directly, another 25% indirectly and they go in and
                    close all the state-owned factories because they're state owned and the
                    principal are, and put all these people out of work. We're watching things that
                    we all knew beforehand. These snap judgments, there was no corporate memory
                    because they didn't want it. It was Clintonian even though it had nothing to do
                    with the administration but that's how it was branded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q.: I take it, how about almost the phrase or the mentality
                        of war against terrorism? It always struck me as this is an intelligence and
                        police thing with maybe some military component.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Yes. My belief is World War II was a perfect war. It was a perfect
                    endeavor, the most perfect endeavor the United States was ever involved in. We
                    were wronged, we were attacked. We were morally right. We mobilized the nation.
                    We remarkably in four years created the greatest superpower in history. We
                    defeated our enemies, unconditional surrender, and reached out and picked them
                    up and made them into a democracy, with free-market economies. It is a
                    movie.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>So what have we done since then? We want to repeat it in everything we do. We
                    declare war on illiteracy, war on drugs, war on poverty; we declare war on
                    everything. It's a metaphor and so when we're faced with this we declare war on
                    tactics, terrorism is a tactic. We don't take the greater context, you know,
                    what I infer you're alluding to. The greater context of this is this is a
                    society in transition, the Islamic world. They're going to come out of this in
                    varying degrees of success or failure. It is trying to come to grips with
                    modernity. You've got those factors — political, economic and social factors —
                    and angry leaders. You've got those that will capitalize on it, like Osama bin
                    Ladens of the world. So there are places where you will not be taking military
                    action. But this is something more than just a war and something more than, you
                    can't win this thing if there is such a thing by killing enough of them and
                    breaking down their finances and breaking down their cells. That's tactics. But
                    strategically, when you look at this, what is going to win out in the end is
                    winning over the youth and the youth have to be won over in that they see hope
                    and a degree of prosperity and a voice, you know, that they can have. If that's
                    denied to them, you know, 9/11 defined our youth, 9/11 defined their youth. It's
                    a battle for the youth and if we make this in terms of war, we pit our
                    generation of the future against their generation. But we play into the hands of
                    Osama bin Laden. So we're not seeing it in the broadest context, we are not
                    seeing it at a strategic level. We only see this at a tactical level. Because we
                    don't understand the new world order. We have never developed a strategy for
                    dealing with it. There are no Kennans and Marshalls out there that understand
                    this new, very complex world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of complex, you mentioned with Clinton he was a
                        learner, is a learner. What were you getting from your colleagues in the
                        upper ranks of the military about George W. Bush? Vis-�-vis the
                        military.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: You know, I think that in terms of the military and the Vietnam
                    experience, I think that stopped being an issue when Clinton got elected. You
                    know, the fact that he was elected and he was antiwar, basically, and grew up
                    away from it. Initially, there was a big emotional effect but after eight years,
                    that kind of passed. That issue didn't really come up. Vietnam tainted
                    everybody. There were no heroes in this thing. You know, you have Clinton who
                    opposed the war so he alienated a lot of people because of that but still got
                    elected president. You had Bush who was in the military but avoided Vietnam
                    through the guard and maybe parental influence or whatever. You had Kerry
                    running, who had a mixed Vietnam record. He went and did it, some question about
                    his performance, but then he came back and threw his medals while in his uniform
                    or whatever, so I think the military has seen this all now. They are not
                    innocent anymore of that stuff. So I do think it becomes basically a non-issue
                    because the only remaining hero who might be president of our generation is
                    McCain possibly. And McCain has issues too so, you know, it was an era that I
                    don't think people look at it anymore in that way. I think that also people
                    think that the military, the senior leadership, constantly worry about those
                    sorts of things. They don't. They have personal political feelings but they tend
                    to be professionally apolitical.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I was really thinking about George Bush, not the
                        background. Was he asking the right questions of his military people,
                        showing intellectual curiosity or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: I mean, of course he was. He hadn't shown that curiosity, but I think the
                    bigger issue revolved around Rumsfeld because you either love him or you hate
                    him. There's no mixed views on him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did anybody kind of love Rumsfeld?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: A lot of the generals that remained extremely loyal and some retired guys
                    that liked his philosophy. You know, go to a high-tech, all air power, you know,
                    intelligence, and technical systems military. I don't think... I think even some
                    that maybe were on the fence he lost and maybe some that maybe were with him in
                    the beginning he certainly lost by the time he left there. You know, I think
                    people read too much into what senior military officers think in those terms.
                    They basically get permission and figure out how to do it. The big issue becomes
                    when civilians come into the business of the uniformed military. You can give me
                    the political objective, you can tell me what you want done, you can give me the
                    political constraints or whatever, but when you start dictating troop numbers
                    and troop movements and tactics and those sorts of things, then I think we have
                    got a serious problem and that's what happened in Iraq.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before you finish this off, it's been fascinating, could
                        you talk a little about what you were doing on the peace things in Southeast
                        Asia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: Yes. On Indonesia, I was asked by Rich Armitage and Colin Powell to work
                    with the Henry Dunant Center, an NGO in Geneva that does peace mediation work,
                    because they had engaged the Free Aceh movement and the government of Indonesia
                    to try to come to some sort of peaceful resolution of the violence in Sumatra
                    with the Acehnese. Our government was supporting the effort, actually some
                    resource support for HDC, the Henry Dunant Center, and Henry Dunant Center
                    wanted to bring in a number of mediators and they had some interesting
                    constructs since they're a very professional mediation business. In this
                    particular one they wanted to use what they called a group of wise men, senior
                    figures that would oversee the mediation process and being figures that are
                    somewhat removed from it and oversee it and can work at another level. They
                    asked the United States to provide preferably a military, a senior military
                    person, retired and we had a former foreign minister from Thailand, we had a
                    member of the House of Lords that was very much interested and his Ph.D. work
                    was on it. We had a Norwegian; you know, we had a number of people, about four
                    or five of us. So the State Department asked me to fill that role formally as a
                    private citizen but, you know, they supported it. So I did this work with them
                    and I have since done other work with HDC too.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>On the Philippines, President Arroyo asked President Bush to help with mediation
                    and working with the Moros and the Moro Islamic Liberation Front. She wanted to
                    reach out to them, and she asked for U.S. support in some of that. USAID had
                    come down there and did some projects and did some other things so the president
                    asked the U.S. Institute of Peace to take on the project and U.S. Institute of
                    Peace asked me to participate in the mediation process. In that role they were
                    looking at me sort of concentrating on the military aspects. We would get into
                    the military monitoring regime or military issues, the security issues and all
                    because I have done that kind of work before on how you set up monitoring
                    programs, how you set up some sort of process where complaints and getting
                    through issues and concerns that are brought up in the way you set up the
                    monitoring committees, investigating teams and that sort of thing. So they
                    wanted me to concentrate on that but also be part of the broader mediation
                    process. I worked both those along with the Israeli-Palestinian thing.</p>
                <p>Before that, in the Clinton administration, he had asked me to work with Tony
                    Lake on trying to get Ethiopia and Eritrea not to go to war so we sort of had
                    the “Tony Tony strategy,” it was called. It ended up they went to war
                    anyway.</p>
                <p>And of course, the first one was with Aidid with Oakley that sort of got me into
                    this business, the mediation business. And I've done a couple of other things
                    like that too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you find your, it's gotten more structured over
                        time, the mediation process.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ZINNI: It's interesting because I got invited to this mediators' forum, which
                    they hold in Oslo every year. They sort of pick a dozen or so mediators around
                    the world to come in and it's sort of a, what have we learned about mediation?
                    Let's share our experiences. It brought in a number of other, you know, really
                    people who have done major work and did it consistently. And like working with
                    HDC, we brought in some professional mediators because this is becoming a now
                    discipline in and of itself. We had Bill Ury who wrote the book, Getting To Yes
                    and getting past no and that sort of thing. You know, that was maybe more the
                    labor-management and other kinds of things negotiation. But this whole business
                    of mediation, facilitation, negotiation now has exploded. There are even now,
                    not just courses in universities around the world, there are majors and you can
                    receive degrees in this now. It has become that elaborately designed and
                    structured. I've learned a lot about it. I've seen the processes work in so many
                    different ways and I've seen so many different approaches. It's great to have a
                    kickback of all these because no one size fits all. I mean, in some cases you
                    bring in international mediators, like the United Nations or some political
                    organization that's regional rather than international and fits, and sometimes
                    you bring AID. Like, I think the United States has got to be the principal
                    mediator in the Israeli-Palestinian for a lot of reasons. And in other places,
                    because of sovereignty issues or something else, the private NGOs are right. It
                    isn't seen as interfering, it doesn't present threats. Who mediates is another
                    thing and whether you mediate or facilitate you know, because they each have
                    meaning so it's become a science and an art all rolled into one.</p>
