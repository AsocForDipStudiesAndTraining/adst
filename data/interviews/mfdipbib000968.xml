                <p>DAVID E. REUTHER</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Raymond C. Ewing</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: August 29, 1996</p>
                <p>Copyright 2002 ADST</p>
                <p>Q: Today is the August 29, 1996. This is an interview with David E. Reuther which
                    is being done on behalf of the Association of Diplomatic Studies and Raymond
                    Ewing is the interviewer. In talking with you today we want to review your
                    Foreign Service career. You apparently went to high school in Seattle,
                    Washington and then went to Occidental College in Los Angeles and a little later
                    came into the Foreign Service. Dave, why don't you tell me a little bit about
                    your early life and how you got interested in the Foreign Service and what else
                    you did before actually joining the Service, which I think was in 1970?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: I have always considered my interest in international events came from
                    being raised in Seattle. As a premier Pacific Ocean port, Seattle offered
                    exposure to the nations and history of the Pacific Rim. The Pacific was where
                    East and West fatefully met and clashed. In school I read extensively about the
                    battles that took place there during World War II. But if history and proximity
                    didn't catch one's eye, Seattle the melting pot did. The main immigrant groups
                    were Scandinavians, of which a large number came after the World War II. There
                    were large Filipino and Japanese communities, and a small Chinese community. The
                    Seattle Art Museum, for example, had few Van Gogh and Degas paintings, but a
                    stimulating collection of oriental art. The University of Washington always had
                    an excellent Far East Asia studies program. Growing up in such an environment
                    encouraged an awareness of Japan and China. Because Seattle was one of the few
                    Pacific entry points into the United States, the city was often exposed to Asian
                    artists touring on Cultural Exchange programs. I distinctly remember watching a
                    performance of Japanese Kabuki performed by a visiting group. Seattle's place in
                    the world and the encouragement of my high school history teacher, Grace Meyers
                    made it seem quite natural to pursue studies in college in political science and
                    international affairs.</p>
                <p>Q: I, also, grew up on the West Coast and was very much aware that we are a
                    Pacific nation and used to think going back East might be to Denver.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>REUTHER: I have similar recollections of experiencing what a vast country the
                    West was. Once my father announced we were going to take our annual two-week
                    camping vacation and go back East. So, we packed our sleeping bags, our tent,
                    our Coleman stove, and jumped in the car and drove and drove and drove for days
                    and finally arrived in Salt Lake City. While that was about as far East as I got
                    when I was growing up, this, and other annual camping vacations around the West,
                    taught me that the U.S. was a country of great beauty and diversity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, you went south to college in Los Angeles.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes, to Occidental College. I was interested in a small, liberal arts
                    college with ready access to the professors and a manageable curriculum. I had
                    taken summer courses at the University of Washington during high school and was
                    very much aware that a campus of tens of thousands was not for me. So many
                    students, so many course offerings, how could one stay focused in such academic
                    abundance? Occidental was the best experience for my curious mind. The Political
                    Science faculty was top notch. I can still remember some of the classroom
                    stories either Raymond McKelvey or Richard Reath would tell which combined the
                    practical and academic and otherwise illustrated the point they were making.
                    Probably most important for my future Foreign Service career, Occidental had a
                    two year History of Civilization requirement. This course illustrated that our
                    generation stood on a road that others had also trod. Starting with the art and
                    religion departments each department discussed the contributions of its field to
                    world history in chronological order. On a practical level this course allowed
                    the students exposure to every professor on the campus. This helped many
                    discover and focus their academic interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your major?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: My major was political science even though Oxy at that time offered an
                    international affairs degree. The difference between the two was the number of
                    required courses you took to prepare for the comprehensive examination. At the
                    end of the four years, because of excitement or curiosity, I found that I had
                    completed more than enough courses in political science, economics and history
                    to be awarded a degree in both political science and international affairs, but
                    I restricted myself to taking the comprehensive exams in the one field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you finished at Occidental in 1965. What did you do
                        aftethat?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>REUTHER: By then I was deeply interested in China and had already focused class
                    papers and read extensively on China. I had been accepted at the Sino-Soviet
                    Institute of The George Washington University in Washington, D.C., in China
                    studies. It therefore seemed like a good idea at the time to start on Chinese
                    language studies. The summer intensive Chinese language program at the
                    University of Washington, however, seemed more like Marine Corps boot camp. The
                    faculty was great, but demanding, and moved us through the material in quick
                    step. It was very frustrating. The only thing that made it survivable was that
                    of the twelve people in this class, eight were Chinese Americans from the
                    Seattle area and they were having an equally difficult time. It turned out that
                    these young men were from families that spoke Cantonese at home. But the
                    meetings of the local Chinese businessmen society were conducted in Mandarin.
                    Because their fathers were unable to participate in the business meetings, they
                    were bound and determined that their sons would have the language to succeed.
                    So, here were these poor guys who were Cantonese speakers with six tones and all
                    the consonants that Mandarin doesn't have, just struggling away. That helped the
                    rest of us get through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was an early lesson, perhaps, of the extreme
                        differences amonChinese.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Oh, absolutely. Like Americans who takes pride in theihome state, the
                    Chinese also identify with their regional origins.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After that intensive summer language program you came
                        tWashington, DC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes, to the Sino-Soviet Institute that Professor Franz Michael had just
                    established at The George Washington University. He was my academic mentor and
                    key to finding the necessary scholarship funds. Professor Michael had an
                    extensive association with China. He and Professor George Taylor were important
                    contributors to the strong China program at the University of Washington. They
                    authored one of the key textbooks, The Far East in the Modern World, used
                    through the last 1950s, early 1960s in Asian survey courses. Their personal
                    history is fascinating. Michael was German, Taylor was British. During the 1930s
                    they arrived in Asia and obtained a employment teaching at Yenching University.
                    Their China was the China trying to modernize and resist the Japanese. Their
                    personal history constantly reminded we students that modern Chinese history
                    didn't begin in 1949.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this an area studies program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Leading to what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>REUTHER: A Masters Degree in international affairs from The George Washington
                    University and a certificate from the Sino-Soviet Institute, a dual
                    certification.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you did mostly China studies. Did you do some Soviet
                        studies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Although an area studies program, there was an implicit assumption that
                    China and the Soviet Union were to be studied as communist nation-states. We
                    were to see communist China, not necessarily Chinese communists. Despite my
                    China concentration, I enrolled in a couple of courses on the Soviet Union. I
                    remember writing a paper on the organization of Soviet agriculture.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you interested at that point primarily in political
                        oeconomic issues or historical and social?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: I'm afraid my interest was encompassing. Ultimately what I found
                    intellectually attractive about studying China was the vast difference between
                    what was happening in China versus how it is perceived in the outside world. The
                    China in American newspapers in the 1960s was a gross characterization of what
                    small reality we knew. So, not only did you have an interesting, unique
                    political culture; but also this American caricatures. It is a great lesson in
                    paradigm construction. Harold Isaacs discussed this very point in his 1958 book
                    Scratches on Our Mind.</p>
                <p>Q: But at that time, in the mid-'60s, you came to The George Washington
                    University to do those studies there was no reality check by field experience.
                    You weren't allowed to go to China.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>REUTHER: And the lack of field experience is what made the subject intellectually
                    challenging. All these things were being said about China in the 1950s and 1960s
                    that seemed more associated with domestic American political partisanship than
                    with Chinese reality. Then there would be intellectual breakthroughs ignored by
                    the political culture because it didn't fit the partisan paradigms. I'm thinking
                    of Donald Zagoria's excellent work on the Sino-Soviet split all drawn from an
                    exegesis of published sources. The implication was that these national
                    leaderships were not communists per se, but Chinese and Russian communists.
                    During the 1950s and 1960s the American Cold War paradigm of monolithic
                    communism reigned supreme. As a consequence, the role of Chinese nationalism in
                    coloring Chinese choices was ignored. On the contrary, in his introduction to
                    the China White Paper in 1949, Secretary of State Acheson argued that Chinese
                    nationalism was a strong force and that, if the U.S. would just bide its time,
                    Chinese nationalism would eliminate Russian influence on China. Acheson argued
                    for a policy of treating China as a Soviet lackey, pressing Beijing and Moscow
                    together under the assumption that Chinese nationalism would corrode the
                    relationship. By 1962 when Zagoria wrote Sino-Soviet Split Chinese nationalism
                    had begun to erode the relationship with Russia—something Acheson predicted. By
                    that time, however, we were in the midst of pretending there was a vast
                    communist conspiracy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get your degree in a couple of years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: I finished all of the course work and was starting on thdissertation
                    when I ran out of money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you had to go to work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: I had to go to work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, you probably worked for the U.S. government since you
                        werhere in Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: That is right. I cast a very wide net. I took the Foreign Service exam,
                    the Civil Service exam, and whatever else was out there. I talked to DIA, CIA,
                    State.</p>
                <p>Q: I see you started out with the National Security Agency as an East Asian
                    analyst for three years from 1967-70 before you came into the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>REUTHER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything special to say about that? Did it give you a
                        chance tuse some of your Chinese and your area studies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes. The National Security Agency (NSA) provides intelligence drawn from
                    the electro-magnetic environment to the analytical community. I joined a program
                    designed to train mid-level managers. This was actually a very interesting
                    experience because the Defense Department has a particular way of training
                    people, that is, from the bottom up. They made you empty wastebaskets, you did
                    the most mundane reports, you were assigned some of the real basic stuff. The
                    idea being that when you become a manager and were directing the work of others,
                    you won't be so silly and arrogant as to demand in an hour some report that you
                    know took you two hours or longer.</p>
                <p>But, what interested me at the time was the reaction of my fellow trainees. The
                    30 people hired for this program were all college graduates, but many were
                    unable to adjust to idea that you had to know what you were talking about before
                    you were given supervisory responsibilities. To them their college degree was a
                    ration card to be exchanged for employment regardless of their interest or
                    capabilities. As you can imagine, those people were weeded out rather
                    quickly.</p>
                <p>At NSA I had some absolutely fascinating experiences. I arrived shortly after the
                    North Koreans attacked and seized the USS Pueblo and was assigned to an office
                    that was still analytically cleaning up some of the aspects of that incident. I
                    did some China work and then I came back to the Korea section and was working
                    there when the North Koreans shot down a Navy intelligence EC-121. On Monday,
                    April 14, at approximately 5:00 pm EST, a four-engine, propeller-driven, Navy
                    EC-121 aircraft took off from its base at Atsugi, Japan, for a reconnaissance
                    mission in the Sea of Japan. The aircraft had 30 Navy personnel and one Marine
                    enlisted man aboard. Shortly before 1:00 am on Tuesday, April 15, the Department
                    of Defense received a report that this reconnaissance aircraft had been downed
                    over the Sea of Japan by North Korean aircraft. This became my baptism in quick
                    response. At that time a senior Air Force NCO, who had been in electronic
                    intelligence since North Africa in WWII, covered North Korean issues. From our
                    small office we collated and analyzed electronic intelligence on the North
                    Korean attack. Our primary focus was to determine the location of the American
                    aircraft. As I recall, the path of the U.S. EC-130 carried it outside the
                    internationally recognized 12- mile limit and that the North Koreans launched
                    when our aircraft was even further away from North Korean air space. We provided
                    our findings to the U.S. intelligence and diplomatic community. We also produced
                    maps and charts, some of which were used during the UN debate of the incident.
                    We worked straight through for about four days, just the two of us with people
                    looking in from time to time. This was a unique and pressured situation.
                    Nevertheless, the experience stood me in good stead during my years with the
                    State Department when coups, crises, or interagency conflict called for a quick
                    response and a cold head.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, somewhere along the line you must have passed the
                        ForeigService examination.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: I passed the Foreign Service exam in 1967. The State Department entrance
                    exam at that time consisted of an extensive written examination, equivalent to
                    the college entrance SAT or graduate level GRE, and an essay. If you passed the
                    written, then you were invited to take an oral examination. The setting was
                    typical. Three gentlemen behind an uncluttered table, you sat in a chair in
                    front. The interview took place on campus so I interviewed with my colleagues.
                    By some luck of the draw, the most intelligent, academically honored, but rather
                    egotistical, student went first. Something went terribly wrong. He left the
                    interview distressed and slammed the door when he exited. That panicked us. If
                    the lion couldn't succeed, what chance did we mice have?</p>
                <p>With failure assured, I had nothing riding on this exercise and decided I would
                    enjoy myself. There were basic questions about tracing the westward expansion of
                    the U.S., art, and my China studies. The interviewer who participated the least
                    suddenly asked me to tell a joke. That caught me flatfooted because I am not a
                    joke teller. I can hardly repeat good jokes I've enjoyed! After a pregnant pause
                    I leaned forward and offered a play on words, pointing out that some
                    commentators were beginning to think the Chinese leader Mao Zedong was a CIA
                    agent. Wasn't he being called the Great Helm's man? (The background is that
                    Richard Helms was CIA Director at the time). Apparently still in active
                    contention, I responded to a number of other questions and subjects. Among these
                    was a what-would-you-do scenario. The basic story assumed you were stationed at
                    a consulate in France, the local business luncheon group invites you to speak on
                    American culture. The issue is what topic would you pick? My line of thinking
                    was that every Frenchman knows the Americans have no culture — except jazz and
                    Jerry Lewis. My father, a jazz aficionado, exposed me to the great talents of
                    that very American medium, so I dipped into his teachings. I've always thought
                    this cross-cultural question was the most difficult of the interview and that my
                    father's love for jazz was why I passed and was placed on the roll of
                    prospective hires.</p>
                <p>At that time, the strain of the Vietnam War on all federal budgets meant that the
                    State Department was not hiring. As you know, one's eligibility on the hiring
                    rooster is valid for only one year. Consequently to maintain eligibility one
                    would have to repeat the exam process every year. However, during that period,
                    on the anniversary of my passing, I received a letter saying that the Department
                    had not hired from the eligibility list and therefore it decided to extend the
                    eligibility of those listed. I took the exam in 1967, got that letter in 1968,
                    and 1969. I didn't think too much of it, I had already started at NSA, married,
                    and begun planting my feet. Another letter came in late 1969 saying that the
                    Department was hiring but one had to go to Vietnam, into the CORDS [Civil
                    Operations and Revolutionary Development Support] program. Newly married,
                    working on China at NSA, I passed on the Department's offer. Early in 1970
                    another letter arrived offering a Foreign Service appointment without
                    prerequisites. The next class started in April. I accepted.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you actually entered in April 1970. Did you do your
                        initiatraining in Washington at the Foreign Service Institute?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: That is right. FSI was an amazing, congested facility spread throughout
                    Rosslyn, Virginia at that time. The Vietnam Training Center occupied the ground
                    floor of a nearby apartment complex. The crowded building at Key Street was
                    where the new recruits were brought. The building seemed poorly adapted to its
                    training function. You bumped into people who were training in a European
                    language, and turned a corner and passed a room where Cambodian training was in
                    progress. The same facility also housed the professional studies program. To new
                    recruits some things really stuck out. I remember our sophomoric bewilderment as
                    someone in the coffee room was described as an officer just returning to
                    Washington after being overseas since Eisenhower was president! When you
                    understand that with the average tour lasting 2-3 years each, that is only four
                    tours. Of course, European tours were longer because they involved less physical
                    hardship than Asian tours.</p>
                <p>The A-100 course was the beginning of our exposure to statecraft and State
                    Department functions. FSI has access to some of the top academic scholars and
                    they would come and lecture to the group. We even had lectures by Joseph
                    Campbell, author of The Power of Myth, who would later have his own show on the
                    Public Broadcast System, PBS. This was all by way of opening our minds to the
                    cross-cultural world we were about to enter. On the other hand, we also had
                    exposure to more internal State Department issues, management issues, like where
                    to go to arrange travel overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that include Consular Training? Wasn't this still the
                        timthat new officers were required to serve first in a consular
                        assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes, the assumption was that everyone would first be going to a consular
                    tour. But as it turned out for myself, the couple of people that went to Vietnam
                    and a couple of others, the consular tour requirement was not as inflexible as
                    we expected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the A-100 course, the first three months, did you
                        have anlanguage training or did you go right away to your first overseas
                        post?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>REUTHER: I was fortunate to draw an assignment that required language training. I
                    must remark though, I presumed that because we had all taken the same written
                    exam and succeeded at the oral exam all those 40 some people, that is State and
                    USIA officers in the same A-100 class would have much in common. On the
                    contrary, the diversity of personality was comforting. I was particularly struck
                    because I would swear that 50 percent of those people had had Peace Corps
                    experience, or were literally coming off their Peace Corps tours. There was one
                    couple that had just returned to the States the Friday before the Monday start
                    of class from Africa. They were literally were in their bush sandals during a
                    Washington spring!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was probably all they had.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: That was precisely the case. Like myself, I found my classmates, middle
                    class men and women from a broad spectrum of academic backgrounds. Despite the
                    stereotypes of the time, there were no rich scones of the elite from Ivy League
                    colleges.</p>
                <p>I remember one morning at the donut and coffee break everyone seemed more
                    reticent than usual. It all stemmed from the day before when a small group of
                    senior Foreign Service wives invited our wives to tea. This was to be a first
                    taste of the social etiquette and responsibilities of the Foreign Service wife.
                    The senior Foreign Service wives spoke of servants, dropping cards, buying
                    antiques and querying, “And of course, your silverware pattern has a fish fork?”
                    These young middle class women, themselves drawn from hometowns all over
                    America, were horrified by the senior wives' presentation. And that night we
                    employees got an earful of how the spouses were not going to put up with such
                    pretentiousness.</p>
                <p>Q: That is interesting because we are talking about 1970 and the Peace Corps was
                    established in 1961 and in many ways the '60s were its heyday and its strongest.
                    Fifty percent of an A-100 from the Peace Corps probably is not the case today.
                    Although over the years the Peace Corps has been an important contributor to the
                    Service.</p>
                <p>REUTHER: Those who are concerned about public service issues, for example who
                    select to pursue a Foreign Service career, would find the A-100 classes of the
                    early 1970s an interesting laboratory. Certainly I approached State with what I
                    think was a fairly standard stereotype — propagated by our political process —
                    that all Foreign Service officers are East Coast, Ivy League schools, and old
                    money. I thought I was the only person to whom that didn't apply. But as we
                    talked, it was obvious this stereotype didn't apply to them either. I don't
                    think we had one Ivy League graduate in there. We are talking Occidental
                    College, Oberlin, Ohio Wesleyan, universities of California and Pennsylvania,
                    Colby. I think what stimulated these people was the outward turning that the
                    country went through during the Kennedy years when these people were in high
                    school. That expansion of horizons, epitomized by the Peace Corps experience,
                    somehow opened their minds and encouraged them along different paths which came
                    together in April, 1970 to the halls of the State Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Q: Was the April, 1970 class the first class that did not have the restriction of
                    going to Vietnam to CORDS, after the long hiatus of hiring?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: No, we were the second. There was another classes between us and the
                    'Vietnam or else' class. Obviously when the Vietnam bound realized that State
                    was not being exactly honest, there was a bit of a revolt. Years later this
                    event still rankles in some memories. Nevertheless, many of those officers who
                    went to Vietnam had extremely productive careers, including some ambassador
                    appointments. The irony probably is that, here the State Department makes this
                    extensive recruitment effort — at the time people said 10,000 took the Foreign
                    Service exam and 100 to 150 were hired annually — and it expected these same
                    people to accept official duplicity. The untold part of the story is that up to
                    ten percent of those assigned to CORDS were Foreign Service officers. On the
                    whole these people had a unique experience in translating ideas into programs.
                    When refugee programs and humanitarian assistance programs became important in
                    later years, the CORDS-experienced provided a tough cadre of people who
                    understood how to make programs work. Twenty years later many a successful
                    officer working the crises in Somalia, northern Iraq or Bosnia had a CORDS tour
                    in his background. One of the better books on CORDS was Richard Hunt,
                    Pacification: The American Struggle for Vietnam's Hearts and Minds (1995) on
                    which I wrote a book review for the Foreign Service Journal.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What language training did you have after the A-100
                        class?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: At the end of class I was assigned to Thailand, after language training.
                    We finished the A-100 class about June and I was assigned to language starting
                    in September. With a three month gap, I was assigned to the Thai desk in
                    Washington and met Director John Dexter and his deputy, Alf Bergesen, both
                    officers with extensive experience, yet willing to take time to mentor.
                    Deadlines and clear writing, that is what the Foreign Service is all about and
                    my training started on the Thai Desk. But there are always tricks of the trade,
                    special rites for the newly initiated. I remember my first official cocktail
                    party - at the Thai embassy. What rules of savoir-faire did my senior colleague
                    pass? Alf said, “Be wary, never drink wine. Always take a drink in a highball
                    glass because the glass will fit into your coat pocket without tipping. You are
                    here to meet people and that means always being free to shake hands. A plate in
                    one hand and a glass in the other won't do it. A wine glass isn't stable enough
                    for a stand-up reception.” That was the lesson of my first diplomatic
                    reception.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: As a junior officer, taking the advice of senior officealways has
                    cachet!</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Q: I don't think I ever put a glass into my pocket. Before we leave the class
                    entirely, you mentioned there was the feeling about Vietnam, partly from
                    personal experience from those who didn't want to go there but wanted an
                    opportunity to go elsewhere and have a normal Foreign Service career, was there
                    a lot of feeling about the Vietnam war at that time, 1970? Was it pretty
                    uniformed against what we were doing there?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: I would say there was the normal amount of wondering what it was all
                    about. This was not a group of people that were so set on a particular point of
                    view that they couldn't entertain other ideas. They really wanted to find out
                    what was going on and they saw this as one measure of performing that function,
                    getting on the inside. Some were there to not prevent Vietnam, but to at least
                    try to understand it. As I said, we had a strong group of people with a
                    demonstrable practical streak, a fair percentage of whom became senior
                    officers.</p>
                <p>There was one interesting experience during the A-100 course that I am not sure
                    whether to count as an expression of our practicality or our idealism. To
                    illustrate problems in policy making, communication, and negotiation, the FSI
                    staff organized us in teams to play Disarmament. This simulation exercise
                    required each team to select a negotiator and a team leader. Each team had 10
                    nuclear weapons and our objective was to negotiate mutual disarmament with
                    another team. Each team privately decided how many weapons to lay aside and then
                    instructed the negotiator who would meet with the representative of the other
                    team. To make the game interesting, the staff required us to ante up 25 cents
                    for each weapon. If an attack was declared, the weapons' cache of each side was
                    subtracted and the team with the most weapons received 25 cents for each surplus
                    weapon. In the first round, each pair of teams lied in their negotiations with
                    the other team and instead of disarming held steady at 10 weapons hoping to win
                    the money if the other side disarmed! So here you were, in the midst of the
                    Vietnam War, with people just out of the Peace Corps, and they couldn't avoid
                    war. Well, this result came as a complete shock to some of our more idealistic
                    members!</p>
                <p>Q: Yes, Vietnam was still in the background. A few years earlier it probably was
                    more controversial. I can remember being in the Department here in 1968-69 and
                    every conversation in the cafeteria seemed to be on that subject, and then being
                    up at Harvard in the spring of 1970, there was a lot of controversy about
                    Cambodia and all, but the end was beginning to come. I think people realized
                    that something had to happen.</p>
                <p>REUTHER: The people in my A-100 class were well aware of Vietnam in particular
                    and the world in general. They hadn't written off anything, but did presume they
                    were there to lend their talents and make some sort of contribution.</p>

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes, in a positive way. These were thoughtful people trying to work
                    through some of the issues. They understood the American system, the pressures
                    on Congress, but probably were less parochial than other generations of
                    Americans. Again, a fair number of these people had gone into the Peace Corps
                    and were already thinking there were other contributions to be made.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you had a few weeks on the Thai desk and started
                        language training.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much language did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Well, I was lucky. At the end of our training we were provided a list of
                    posts with junior officer positions and asked our preferences. My recollection
                    is that there were only three Asian posts on the list and a Political Section
                    job at the embassy in Thailand was as close as I could get to China. I checked
                    Thailand and on the last day of the class, assignments were announced. Bangkok
                    it was! Unbeknownst to me, however, State inspectors had recently completed an
                    evaluation of the staffing in Bangkok. Their report recommended abolishing my
                    junior officer position in the political section. So, suddenly I was in language
                    training, but without an onward assignment. In time the embassy suggested
                    waiting until the next Thai language position opened the following summer. That
                    allowed me a full year of Thai study, a luxury considering junior officers were
                    only supposed to receive six months language training.</p>
                <p>I think one of the interesting things about Washington, going back to David
                    Brinkley's book on wartime Washington, was its lack of major immigrant
                    communities, such as New York or San Francisco. With the start of language
                    training in the fall of 1970 the teachers were eager that we have an opportunity
                    to experience Thai cuisine. But, Washington at that time had no Thai
                    restaurants. So, the next best thing was to go to a fairly broken down
                    Szechuan-style Chinese restaurant that had spicy food. What is remarkable is
                    that when I returned five years later, Washington was full of Thai restaurants.
                    Large numbers of Asian immigrants finally arrived in the Washington area.</p>
                <p>Q: Do you think that change in Washington was related to the end of the Vietnam
                    war and the influx of refugees?</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Not necessarily. We should first understand the attraction of American
                    academic institutions for overseas students. Many of these restaurants were
                    operated by people who had come for a university education, liked the U.S., and
                    stayed. The establishment of ethnic restaurants is a vital and common part of
                    America's immigrant tradition. Consider: why is it easier to establish a Chinese
                    restaurant in the U.S., than an Italian restaurant in China? My favorite place
                    is a Thai restaurant on Connecticut Avenue. There's an interesting Foreign
                    Service story here. When we came back from Thailand, it was one of the first
                    Thai restaurants to open in the Washington area. Nearby in Bethesda there was a
                    Shakey's Pizza (This is 1976.) and I suddenly realized I could understand the
                    non-English conversation in the next booth — Thai. I leapt over the booth and
                    said in my best Thai, “Who are you? What are you doing here?” It turns out this
                    is the owner of 'my' Thai restaurant on Connecticut Avenue. He was embarrassed
                    to say his American born kids only ate out at pizza restaurants. He had come as
                    a student and thought opening a restaurant was the thing to do when he decided
                    to stay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And now there are plenty of Thai restaurants in
                        Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Wonderful Thai restaurants!</p>

                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you finally got to your first overseas post in
                        1971?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Right. We got there in August/September, 1971.</p>
                <p>Q: Was that your first trip outside of the United States?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes, if you don't count Vancouver, Canada, which is a Seattle's neighbor
                    to the north.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>It was all quite a wonder. We stopped in Japan on our way. An A-100 colleague was
                    already in Tokyo so we had an inexpensive place to stay. We rode the bullet
                    train and visited Kyoto. I had seen Kabuki performances in the States; on our
                    last day in Tokyo we watched with the luggage in the lobby until the last minute
                    dash to the airport. We arrived in Bangkok on a weekend, were met at the
                    airport, and taken under the wing of an embassy colleague from the Political
                    Section. In those days there was somebody from the embassy to get you settled,
                    you were not just tossed into a hotel room. With our administrative check-in
                    completed, we immediately flew up-country to take up the assignment at the
                    consulate in Udorn. My stomach was already suffering the effects of new diet and
                    new spices.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't you remind me exactly where Udorn is in
                        reference tBangkok and to neighboring countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: The travel books always tell you Thailand looks like an elephant's head
                    with an ear off to the right-hand side and the trunk becoming the peninsula.
                    That ear is northeast Thailand, about a third of the population of the country
                    is there. The Thai center of gravity, if you will, is the Chao Phya River valley
                    that stretches from Chiang Mai in the north to Bangkok. All of the Thai capitals
                    since the 13th century are on that river one way or another. Northeast Thailand
                    is on a plateau, about 500 feet above sea level and except for one little
                    stretch of mountains is literally as flat a piece of land as I have ever seen.
                    In fact, what was so remarkable about the northeast plateau —to a Seattle boy —
                    was that the horizon didn't leap out in front of you and soar another 10,000
                    feet. It was boringly flat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In those days we had a consulate also in Chiang Mai.
                        REUTHER: That's right. And in Songkhla.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big a post was Udorn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Udorn was a three-person post. A consul and two vicconsuls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were one of the vice consuls, probably the junior vice
                        consul.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Very junior vice consul!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did consular work, visas, etc.?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>REUTHER: No, actually the post had no visa issuing authority, so I missed the
                    consular experience which most of my A-100 colleagues had. State Department
                    standard practice was that the A-100 graduates' first assignment was a consular
                    tour. But, Udorn, Thailand, was a very unique assignment. The post's primary
                    responsibility was political and economic reporting, with a focus on the local
                    insurgency and oversight of the U.S. military presence. There was an insurgency
                    in the inaccessible, mountainous parts of northeast Thailand, funded and
                    assisted by the Vietnamese and the Chinese. This made Thailand one of the
                    dominos. So, we were very focused on how the Thai were responding to the local
                    guerrilla threat. The consul in Udorn when I arrived was Tom Barnes. Tom already
                    had extensive CORDS experience in Vietnam and was a strong admirer of John Paul
                    Vann. His focus and dynamism played out in many ways, but he was intensely
                    interested in counter-insurgency issues. This worked to my advantage. We were in
                    southeast Asia, next door to the Vietnam War. There was plenty of responsibility
                    and little need for formality. Junior officers at Udorn had more responsibility
                    than was the normal case for the Foreign Service. For example, administratively
                    Tom Barnes divided the 13 provinces in the Northeast between the two vice
                    consuls, one in charge of the northern half and the other in charge of the
                    southern half. Your job was to visit each of your provinces, each district
                    within each of those provinces and gain a feel for the caliber of the local
                    officials stationed there, the tasks and challenges that they faced and the
                    nature of the insurgency. We did a tremendous amount of traveling in our
                    consular district. We wore out two British Land Rovers on those laterite roads.
                    We were knowledgeable about each district, but in considerable disfavor with the
                    embassy administrative officer whose budget couldn't support new vehicles. Tom,
                    himself, traveled extensively and was known as the officer who had visited every
                    district in the northeast, some 126.</p>
                <p>The consulate's interest in the insurgency wasn't our local fixation, but an
                    integral part of the American presence in Thailand. At that time the embassy
                    included the Development and Security Section, in addition to your typical
                    political and economic sections. William N. Stokes was counselor of embassy for
                    Development and Security in the early 1970s. In bureaucratic theory,
                    organization reflects interests and here was a whole separate section focused on
                    the insurgency in Thailand and the Royal Thai Government's response.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that the two vice consuls covered half of
                        thnortheast. Which half was your responsibility?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: I had the southern half which included the provinces from Korat to Ubon
                    along the Cambodian border. I also monitored the U.S. Air Force facilities on
                    the Thai bases in Korat and Ubon.</p>
                <p>Q: To what extent was there interaction with what was going on in Cambodia and
                    Laos in that period? Were their refugees coming? Were you interested in what was
                    happening there or was that pretty much being taken care of by others?</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Reporting on Cambodia was not our primary responsibility. The Thai-
                    Cambodian border is extremely rugged, steep cliffs, sparse populations on both
                    sides so interchange was difficult. From time to time we would forward a report
                    from our conversations with the Thai Border Patrol Police who were responsible
                    for the Cambodian border. During one of my trips a Thai Border Patrol Police
                    patrol escorted the consulate political local, Wongphan Na Lamphon, and I to the
                    temple at Khao Phra Wiharn. The World Court ruled years earlier that this temple
                    stood on Cambodian territory. Standing on a cliff overlooking a valley that
                    reminded me of Yosemite, it was clear that the temple was inaccessible from
                    Cambodia. We interviewed the local Cambodian commander in one of those
                    Cambodian-French-Thai-English conversations that doesn't reveal much. The
                    consulate's priorities were elsewhere and we didn't have the refugee problem
                    that later emerged from Cambodia and Laos. From 1971-73, the borders were very
                    quiet. Of course, there was the time when the Vietnamese infiltrated a sapper
                    team all the way across from Laos to Udorn and attacked the base in late
                    1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Attack what base?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: The Thai base in Udorn in late 1972. One reason the consulate was
                    located in the Northeast was to monitor the presence of some 42,000 GIs,
                    primarily air force personnel, stationed at four Thai bases — Udorn, NKP (Nakhon
                    Phenom), Ubon and Korat. At each of these bases, the USAF had a wing of
                    aircraft. Udorn also held the 7/13th Air Force subquarters. By 1971, other bases
                    used earlier in the war, such as Thakli, were closed. The arrangements for the
                    bases reflected common ground between Thai pride and our needs. In the 1960s
                    this translated into an arrangement where we used these facilities at the
                    invitation of the Thai Government. These were not U.S. bases; the senior
                    commander was the Thai base commander. The consulate's role was to make sure
                    that the American component on those bases had good relations with the Thai
                    civilian community.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>Consulate officers were well placed to monitor base-community relations. We had
                    the language; we stayed in town, not on the base, when we visited. We often
                    invited a government official to join us for dinner and as the evening
                    progressed people from a variety of Thai offices might stop by our table. We
                    could quiz these officials on the insurgency, base-community relations, whatever
                    was of interest. We also made formal calls on provincial officials from the
                    governor on down. Our frequent visits and passable language skills supported
                    camaraderie with the local officials that kept us well informed on local
                    attitudes and problems. These consulate trips were an important part of making
                    certain that the Thai and American governments were informed and comfortable.
                    The governor or mayor knew that he could talk to us and, therefore, resolve a
                    problem. It would have been a shocking departure for a Thai official to call in
                    the ranking American air force officer and say, “Your people have erred, I want
                    you to do this, that and the other thing.” That sort of explosion is the worse
                    case scenario we were there to prevent. The consulate and its American officers
                    were an important part of a feedback mechanism. Errors or arrogance could be
                    costly.</p>
                <p>Thankfully, cross-cultural errors they were infrequent. My primary United States
                    Air Force contacts were the base commanders and the wing commanders at the two
                    bases I covered, Korat and Ubon. These air force representatives were absolutely
                    marvelously trained, culturally sensitive and profession gentleman. They
                    understood the importance of base-community relations and were very willing to
                    listen to whatever feedback we might offer. You have to understand that I was
                    the equivalent of a second lieutenant in my own organization and I was
                    interacting with a senior colonel of another organization. The exemplary
                    cooperation I saw between those two American national defense establishments was
                    key to smoothly advancing America's interests.</p>
                <p>Q: Did the embassy take a lot of interest in your area? Did the ambassador travel
                    up often? Or was it pretty much left to the three of you?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: The embassy exhibited a strong interest in our insurgency and political-
                    military reporting. It would commission reports or ask for contributions to
                    larger reporting projects. We would have some visitors, but I can only recall
                    one ambassadorial visit. Leonard Unger was the ambassador. He had been
                    ambassador since September 1967 and earlier served as the DCM in Bangkok from
                    1958-62. He had already met everybody in country during his long ambassadorial
                    tour. The rumor around the embassy was that the ambassador's long tour
                    represented Washington's general reluctance to move ambassadors in Southeast
                    Asia during the Vietnam War. The argument was that this was a way of avoiding
                    the prospect of public testimony before Congress upon reassignment. Ambassador
                    Unger was a strong and knowledgeable ambassador, much beloved by his staff. His
                    wife, Anne, was delightful and sympathetic to family problems overseas. The
                    ambassador and his wife demonstrated the best professionalism and humanity of
                    the career service.</p>

                <p>Q: Besides the substantive political reporting and working with the American Air
                    Force, did you do anything else? Any economic or commercial work?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: Northeast Thailand was an outpost of the Vietnam War, so economic and
                    commercial work didn't come to Udorn. Because the Northeast was the poorest part
                    of Thailand, one focus was to monitor implementation of joint AID/Thai
                    government rural development programs. One AID representative was stationed in
                    almost each of our Northeast provinces. Over the years AID program in the
                    Northeast had been extensive and covered a number of development issues: finding
                    new crops for the people to grow, and locating scarce water. Th Northeast
                    benefited from one of the best road-building programs in the world. The Thai
                    were lucky there was any room left to grow any crops! The idea behind the road
                    building was to make it possible for the most rural farmer to bring his crop to
                    market and not lose revenue to a middleman.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: By the early 1970s Thailand had an extensive feeder road network. Of
                    course, the best roads linked the provincial capitals. The farther from the
                    provincial capital, the more primitive the road. When we visited district-level
                    offices along the Cambodian border, we often traveled unimproved, rutted
                    laterite tracks. Passengers and vehicle were totally covered in dust by the time
                    we reached our next stop.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Surely AID had a mechanism to report on its programs. What
                        wathe consulate's role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: The high water mark of AID officers in the field had passed. For
                    budgetary and other reasons, AID presence was shrinking; programs were turned
                    over to Thai agencies, such as Accelerated Rural Development (ARD) of the
                    Ministry of Interior. With our language skill, our regimen of visiting every
                    province and acquainting ourselves with Thai officials, it was natural for the
                    consulate to submit follow-up reporting from time to time on development issues.
                    When we traveled to a province, we called on the governor and his immediate
                    staff and, with that entr�e, talked to the police or representatives of other
                    Thai agencies.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>Toward the end of my tour I recall reporting on Thai implementation of a program
                    to provide up-country villages with water pumps. Despite the stereotype of
                    Southeast Asia as lush jungle, northeast Thailand was almost a desert plateau,
                    so, improving access to water was a important quality of life program. We found,
                    in our trips to representative villages and the provincial headquarters, that
                    the Thai program, administered out of Bangkok, was broadly based and evident in
                    every province. A large number of the pumps, however, were broken and
                    unrepaired. An interesting lesson in the complex process of modernization. The
                    AID/Thai program sank the wells and provided the pumps. Overuse, misuse, or age
                    rendered the equipment unusable after an interval and then village leaders were
                    at a loss as to repairs. ARD had no maintenance or follow-up program.</p>
                <p>I found this dilemma interesting because of the academic debate over initiative
                    versus organization in any society. This debate was most succinctly stated in a
                    common self- comparison between the American and German armies during World War
                    II. The story paints a picture of the American GI dashing around Europe until
                    his jeep breaks down. The American finds some gum, fixes the problem and dashes
                    off. When the German vehicle breaks down, the Germans would sit by their vehicle
                    and await the arrival of the organizational unit responsible for fixing
                    vehicles. Well, what that means is that maintaining requirement is an acquired
                    awareness. The Thai villager who had never dealt with much mechanical equipment
                    was untrained, not incapable. In the end our suggestion was that the Thai water
                    agency provide the village headman with a post card to call for help.</p>
                <p>Q: Reporting on insurgency, base-community relations, program monitoring, is
                    there any other responsibility which was a priority with the consulate?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: One of the programs to which we contributed was USIA's International
                    Visitor Program. At the height of the American Foreign Service presence in
                    Thailand in the late 1960s we had three consulates, and a USIS library and an
                    AID mission in almost every province. We became very familiar with Thailand. The
                    embassy was always on the alert for highly talented people from all walks of
                    Thai life. Our International Visitors Program gave us the opportunity to pick
                    some of their best and brightest and provide them an opportunity to experience
                    the United States, its people, institutions and history. The program was
                    successful at recognizing talented Thai. Some Thai agencies saw our IV program
                    as sort of a genius award sort of thing. If we choose one of the officers in
                    their ministry, that was a boost to his career. The Interior Ministry, in
                    particular, understood what the Americans were looking for, initiative,
                    understanding, get-up-and- go, can-do attitude. The IV program paid enormous
                    benefits for us both in helping the Thai understand the U.S. and in stimulating
                    the Thai bureaucracies to select on the basis of talent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were able to nominate people that you identified as
                        yotraveled around?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Exactly, and because of our extensive travel, we met district officers
                    or deputy district officers. So, you are talking about somebody 28 to 35 years
                    of age who easily will be in the service of his country until age 60. In
                    identifying talent so early, we built a reservoir of goodwill toward the United
                    States. Of course, we also picked more senior officers, governors, deputy
                    governors and program directors. I suppose the point is the high quality of our
                    choices was a function of our contact with a broad range of the Thai people, not
                    just the talent that might accumulate in a nation's capital.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Oh, I'm sorry, my sector had seven provinces and probabl60
                    districts.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Right. There were 72 provinces in Thailand at that time. Q: Were there
                    Peace Corps volunteers in Thailand?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes. Thailand hosted an extensive Peace Corps program. Thailand's was
                    one of the largest programs that the Peace Corps ever had and I think it remains
                    in the top five programs. As official Americans, we were instructed to stay away
                    from the Peace Corps Volunteers. We certainly didn't need to turn to them for
                    information on the local situation, we had our own very accessible official and
                    unofficial sources. So, our contact with the Peace Corps volunteers was pretty
                    much confined to Thanksgiving and Christmas when we would host an American
                    party. We invited the volunteers in for good food, good company and a long hot
                    shower — some of them had rather basic accommodations. Their programs were all
                    quite interesting but out of our vision.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about American missionaries?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>REUTHER: My next door neighbors in Udorn were an elderly American missionary
                    couple, who arrived in Udorn in 1938! At that time they landed in Saigon,
                    unloaded their vehicle and drove to Udorn. It wasn't until long after the war
                    that you could drive into the northeast from Bangkok. They stayed in Udorn
                    during World War II with the Thai partisans protecting them. The Japanese
                    apparently did not bother them. Because of their long residence in the area,
                    they had seen a significant change in Thailand's economy and had taught every
                    Udorn governor English since the far recesses of history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other consulates in Udorn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: No. Americans were the only ones so crazy as to be out there. In all
                    reality, the consulate's presence was a function of the fact that the
                    subquarters of the 7/13th Air Force was on the Udorn base, as well as a fighter
                    wing, and the Air America operation.</p>
                <p>Q: And that post was closed?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes, just recently closed. One third of the population of Thailand and
                    an increasingly dynamic economy just disappeared from American awareness. I can
                    say that because Thailand did not have a national newspaper that covered the
                    provinces as well as consulate reporting covered it.</p>
                <p>Q: If Udorn was a reporting outpost collateral to the Vietnam War... It was
                    upcountry. I don't suppose there were any congressional visitors.</p>
                <p>REUTHER: In the two years I was there, no congressmen visited. When I worked
                    refugee issues in the mid-1980s, I escorted a number of concerned
                    congresspeople, such as Congresswoman Pat Schroeder. The Vietnam era was a
                    different time in relations between Congress and State. The one congressional
                    incident I had at the time was an encounter with Moose and Lowenstein.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were a notable pair, staffers from the Senate
                        ForeigRelations Committee, I believe?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>REUTHER: That's right. Richard Moose and James Lowenstein were staff
                    investigators for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and by the early 1970s
                    had a reputation with the Foreign Service. As I recall, when they visited in
                    1972 I was alone at the consulate. Tom Barnes and the other officer were
                    traveling. A telephone call from the embassy's Political-Military Section
                    alerted me that Moose and Lowenstein were in Thailand and might come to Udorn. I
                    was to be polite, but not accommodate their rumored interest in entering the
                    Thai Air Force base at Udorn. At issue for us was that the bases we were flying
                    from in Thailand remained under the control of Thailand. We had no status of
                    forces agreement. The RTG [Royal Thai Government] was in total charge. It would
                    be a violation of the arrangements between the American and Thai governments for
                    me to assist Moose and Lowenstein to enter a Thai base.</p>
                <p>The embassy's warning turned out to be correct. Moose and Lowenstein - I think
                    this was 1972 - showed up in Udorn, came to the consulate and demanded that I
                    gain them access to the Thai base and the American units it contained. They were
                    not interested in being deflected from their task. I remember this conversation
                    because I was threatened and insulted in ways that I had never previously
                    experienced. The one threat that still rings in my ears was their threat to ruin
                    my career, if they did not get their way. I may have been on my first tour in
                    the Foreign Service, but I was a China scholar and I had heard stories in the
                    hallways of congressional blacklists and the reality that Congress can and does
                    destroy Foreign Service careers. What made the threat all the more believable
                    was that you know that the highest levels of the State Department are not about
                    to protect some first tour officer from congressional wrath. After the
                    browbeating I took from Moose and Lowenstein, I was certain that my career was
                    over. Others tried to cheer me up, but I lived with this fear for some weeks
                    until nothing happened and I decided that I was too small a fish for them to
                    waste their time on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your reporting primarily to the embassy or directly
                        tWashington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Our line of command went directly to the embassy and the embassy decided
                    whether it would forward our reporting or include it into broader embassy
                    reporting. I can't recall whether the embassy ever failed to pass on our
                    reporting. On the other hand, there is what I call the distillation issue. My
                    experience is serving — in succession—an up country consulate (Udorn), an
                    embassy political section, and then a Washington desk. What I saw in the course
                    of three tours was that our beautiful 4-5 page reports on the insurgency
                    situation in, say, Chaiyaphom province would be come a paragraph in the
                    embassy's weekly report to the Department and distilled further into a mention
                    about political stability in a report to the assistant secretary. You see the
                    squeezing of information very quickly in that sort of situation. Direct
                    reporting avoids some of this, if Washington is properly staffed, otherwise it
                    just clogs the desks of the few Washington officers.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there times when there were differences in the
                        analysis osomething between the consulate and the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: A few, mostly confined to the issue of the insurgency. The embassy's
                    Development and Security Office seemed wedded to the Thai perception that
                    everything was under control. In Udorn was Consul Tom Barnes with long
                    experience in Vietnam and who claimed the honor of having visited every district
                    in the Northeast. So, we would report an ambush or guerrilla movement, some
                    military activity, and the government in Bangkok would say it was no big deal.
                    DS accepted the Thai evaluation and blocked our reporting and analysis that the
                    Thai weren't doing enough in the field to hold these things down. Udorn reported
                    that the Thai were not quite doing the military necessary, and perhaps actually
                    avoiding the guerrillas in some areas. And, in fact, it was a fairly low-level
                    insurgency that fed on peasant resentments but lacked a claim to nationalism.
                    Insurgencies that do not have a nationalism appeal can be managed.</p>
                <p>Q: Where there was a difference in views, did you feel you could convey that
                    through an airgram to Washington or was the embassy preventing that from
                    happening?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: Because this transpired during the Vietnam War insurgency reporting was
                    cable reporting. When Tom thought that the DS section was grievously wrong he
                    would go to Bangkok and raise his objections in conference with the DS section
                    and the ambassador. The ambassador had been there for a long time so as things
                    tended to reoccur he had the awareness that perhaps we shouldn't always take the
                    word of the Thai that everything was going okay. Like Tom, there were large
                    numbers of Foreign Service officers with Vietnam experience who were willing to
                    hear all sides of an issue. At stake in the intra-American discussion of the
                    insurgency in Thailand was a cross-cultural issue about whether the Thai shared
                    the American can-do attitude. Some argued the Thai were handling the situation,
                    others argued that if the embassy didn't hold them to a can-do standard, then
                    they will succumb to somebody who was more adept.</p>

                <p>Q: Was the Thai military quite strong within the country? What was the government
                    system in Thailand at that time? Was it pretty centralized without much
                    democracy?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: By contemporary standards the Thai Government in the early 1970s would
                    rank low on anyone's 'freedom index.' The government was run by two military
                    officers, Thanom Kittikachorn and Praphat Charusathien. There was no parliament,
                    it had been disbanded at the start of the Vietnam war period. Factions based in
                    the military controlled the country's political life. The key event in
                    post-World War II Thai politics occurred when Sarit Thanerat, who ran the army,
                    faced off in 1957 against another faction headed by Phao Sriyanon, which
                    controlled the police. Sarit's success left the country with a military
                    dominated government. The casual observer at the time could have seen a typical
                    Latin American military run country.</p>
                <p>Q: Thailand in recent years has been extremely successful economically in
                    exports. Had any of that begun to get underway during the time you were there in
                    the early '70s?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: From the perspective of the consulate in Udorn most of that economic
                    growth would come later. What we saw was the groundwork; the infrastructure
                    projects; the tremendous road system; the various water projects; the
                    development of human skills and dedicated administrative organizations to direct
                    development resources. Japanese investment was just arriving. Thailand's
                    economic blossoming was in the future. By the time I returned to Thailand for
                    another tour ten years later, these economic seeds came to fruition.</p>
                <p>One of the keys to later development was American spending on the Vietnam War in
                    Thailand. This included the development of significant skills within the Thai
                    population. For example, the payroll section of the American Air Force unit on a
                    Thai base might consist of an NCO and seven Thai, three or four of which the Air
                    Force would have taken back to the United States and given further training in
                    finance, financial management, statistics, accounting and related subjects. When
                    the American military presence departed, we left a sophisticated, English
                    speaking middle class. Our departure coincided with the Middle East oil embargo
                    that placed vast amounts of wealth in the coffers of the oil producing
                    countries. Companies with on contracts in the Middle Easthired American-trained
                    Thai as skilled overseas workers. So, vast numbers of Thai who worked for us at
                    the up-country bases went to the Middle East for jobs as office workers or
                    project managers.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was well paid.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Well paid by Thai standards. When I went back to the northeast in 1985,
                    I couldn't believe it. Streets were paved, new housing was going in,
                    agricultural processing plants existed where there hadn't been any before. It
                    was just totally different. But, again, all of this was in the future. When I
                    was there first, it was a military run government, no parliament. Who could have
                    predicted the consequences of the Thai students studying in the U.S. at the
                    time, the increasing professionalization of the Thai bureaucracies established
                    as counterparts to an American or international equivalent, the impact of
                    Japanese investment, and the role of Thai self-confidence?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds to me to sort of summarize, you had an unusually
                        diverse and fascinating first tour in a country that was obviously very
                        important to the United States at the time and in part of the country where
                        a lot of interesting things were going on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: I was fortunate that my interest in Asia brought me to Thailand under
                    circumstances which exposed me to the U.S. military, AID programs, and
                    humanitarian assistance. Subjects which would weave themselves in and out of my
                    career for the next 25 years. In fact, two decades later I was working in the
                    Pentagon and realized that the Air Force general I worked for was an F-4 pilot
                    at Udorn at the time I was there. Starting from the same place, we both had full
                    careers within our own professions and again came to work together. However
                    anecdotal, this illustrates how intimately involved State and Defense are and
                    should be.</p>
                <p>Another illustration of Foreign Service and uniformed service cooperation in the
                    field - and the resource differences at the time between our departments - was
                    the “brick” that we carried in Udorn. Today we think nothing of lightweight
                    cellular phones, but the early 1970s equivalent was the Motorola portable radio.
                    Each of use in the Udorn consulate had such a portable radio and a recharging
                    stand for its battery, issued to us by the American military. We were hooked
                    into the U.S. command net at the Udorn base. This arrangement was necessary, not
                    only to maintain 24-hour contact with our military, but also to overcome the
                    unreliable Thai telephone system. The radio was literally the size and weight of
                    a brick and uncomfortable to carry. At social occasions people would often set
                    them down (together) resulting in a scramble to select the one that was
                    beeping!</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Let me say something of cross cultural communication and its application to
                    problems on our side. My next tour was in the embassy Political Section and one
                    of the things that we consistently did was use the ambassador's dinners as
                    venues to introduce sub-Cabinet Thai officials to each other. Many Thai
                    bureaucrats worked similar issues but didn't professionally meet. So, we
                    performed the function of acquainting Thai officials to each other. The American
                    penchant for interagency meetings - a mark of the value we placed on policy
                    coordination - is a value that the Vietnam War forced the Thai to adopt. Other
                    bureaucracies simply didn't understand the value of coordination. Such dinner
                    parties with their theme of coordination sounds nice of us, but we were just
                    passing on hard-won lessons. One of my lessons from this first tour was the
                    absolute need for liaison with the Air Force, the Agency, AID and with all the
                    other organizations that were out there. You were part of a team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it pretty much the Air Force rather than the Army or
                        Navy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: The Army had a small facility at Udorn, but not much of presence.</p>
                <p>Q: So you finished your two-year tour in Udorn and then went down to the embassy
                    in Bangkok. You didn't go up to Mexico City or to issue visas somewhere?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: My luck held. My DCM was very pleased with what we were doing up-
                    country and he was quite willing to encourage personnel to make sure that my
                    next tour was in the embassy political section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had home leave but no further training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of job did you have within the political
                        section?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>REUTHER: The political section at that time was divided into two sections,
                    external and internal reporting. The external reporting unit followed Thai
                    attitudes towards Cambodia or ASEAN issues; Thailand's foreign policy stance,
                    that sort of thing. There was even a China watcher. Bill Kushlis, myself, and a
                    couple of other people were assigned to the internal reporting unit. We looked
                    at domestic issues: we sought to identify who were the movers and shakers in the
                    Thai system, the major political factions, and what were the personality and
                    policy issues within the Thai bureaucracies. The Thai ministry of Interior was
                    highly centralized and attractive to a talented Thai civil service. Because I
                    already met a large number of Ministry of Interior officers up-country, it
                    seemed natural to be in the internal section. My previous experience thus gave
                    the embassy an advantage in working with the important Ministry of Interior.</p>
                <p>I think my first few weeks in the Political Section were typical of Foreign
                    Service political work. One of my early jobs was to write extensive political
                    biographies on the main Thai players. I particularly remember writing on Air
                    Vice Marshal Dawee Chunlasap. Biographic writing may not sound fascinating, but
                    it is key to the skills of the Foreign Service. To write a bio, you have to
                    investigate history as seen by those in the country where you are stationed.
                    What was their view of history as they lived it and what did they take away from
                    that experience? In Dawee's case, he was a young officer when World War II broke
                    out. He was a member of the faction that associated itself with the United
                    States. That faction prospered in the post-war world, vice the faction that
                    allied with Japan. So, one quickly learns the basic lesson of diplomacy - if you
                    don't understand the other side's history, you will miss the common elements
                    needed to build friendships and international consensus.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>Within weeks of my return from home leave in the States, Thailand was in crisis.
                    October 16, 1973 was a day I will never forget. Since early October, the Thai
                    student union organized anti-government demonstrations in Bangkok protesting the
                    lack of democracy. As was oft the case, the students and their leaders
                    represented elite academic institutions. There was considerable popular support
                    for the students. The public provided food and blankets during the student
                    sit-in at a central park. Suddenly, that October day, it all went sour. Shooting
                    started. Army units associated with the son of Prime Minister Thanom shot on
                    student marchers, so it was a pretty messy business. For the embassy, this
                    crisis raised a number of issues. We still had a major military presence,
                    extensive commercial interests, and a large American community. We needed to
                    know what was going on and we needed to protect American interests without
                    meddling in an internal Thai matter. At the time I supervised the Political
                    Section's internal reporting unit. Our first task was the same as any media
                    journalist, get the story and get it in the hands of our Washington leadership
                    with dispatch so that the Department could make the policy determinations. We
                    had officers from every section of the embassy working in our crisis center or
                    out on the street during the gunfire. I remember one of the military attach�s
                    put on this loud Hawaiian shirt and had one for his son, and the two of them got
                    into his radio-equipped car and went to where the shooting was. They would pose
                    as two lost tourists, poke around a little bit, and then return to the car and
                    radio in what they saw. About 150 people were massacred and many more injured.
                    It was just one mess, just incredible. Everything was rumored, and we had to
                    chase down every rumor. We had to keep vacationing GIs and American tourists our
                    of harm's way. The consular section people called hotels to pass the word and be
                    alert to missing tourists. We ran a 24-hour operation for days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a result of that the government fell?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: The government fell. Thanom and Praphat had to leave. There was no way
                    they could recoup the loss. The king moved against them and they flew off to
                    Taiwan — an interesting destination for these two.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the new government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Sanya Thammasakdi, a senior member of the judiciary, conservative and
                    close to the King, headed the new government. It was a very difficult time for
                    Thai authorities and for the embassy. We had 42,000 Air Force personnel in the
                    country. Washington's concern was the change of government's impact on our troop
                    presence. As Vietnam wound down the White House had its hands full, and was
                    sensitive to congressional reaction. The image of having fought in Vietnam to
                    thwart the paradigm of dominos falling to the communists and then getting kicked
                    out of Thailand by a democracy movement was a nightmare for some. I understand
                    that Secretary Kissinger and Ambassador Unger spoke often. There was an
                    ambivalence to the protesters' attitudes toward the U.S. On one hand we were
                    accused of supporting the previous regime; on the other we were the paragon of
                    democracy. In the meantime we were reporting everything we could uncover on
                    attitudes toward the U.S.</p>
                <p>In reporting the coup events and their aftermath, my internal affairs unit
                    competed with the Foreign Broadcast Information Service (FBIS), another USG
                    agency, which was sending Washington translations of the local Thai press, a
                    source that was a little flamboyant, if not misleading, at that time. We were
                    under great pressure to transmit our reporting cables and beat FBIS's
                    translations to Washington. Rapid composition, with balance, and covering the
                    appropriate subjects; that's what the Foreign Service teaches. The absence of
                    balanced reporting leaves Washington in a difficult policy situation. I mean, we
                    literally had the impression that the Secretary's office would call the
                    ambassador and say, “What is this we read in the Thai press that the Americans
                    are going to be thrown out, or the Thai government can't respond, etc.” For
                    weeks after the coup, Washington's sensitivities were such that the political
                    section was chained to subjects FBIS reported and driven to beat FBIS deadlines.
                    That went on for about three months before sanity finally prevailed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The FBIS bureau was in Bangkok?</hi>

                <p>REUTHER: Yes, FBIS was one of a number of offices in Bangkok that made the
                    embassy the second largest mission in the world at that time. Because Bangkok
                    was a transportation hub across the Pacific and from Europe, the embassy
                    encompassed all the State Department's regional officers, payroll, courier, and
                    medical. As well, we had a large State/USIA representation, an enormous AID
                    contingent, and an extensive military contingent. An embassy performs many
                    functions and often hosts a variety of federal agencies. In our case, when all
                    assigned staff was counted, Bangkok was the second largest embassy in the world.
                    Cairo was the largest at that time.</p>

                <p>REUTHER: Ambassador Unger was still there when I first returned to Bangkok for my
                    second tour. But Vietnam was winding down and he was eager for another
                    assignment. The issue of who would be the next American ambassador became an
                    important psychological element in post-coup Thai thinking. I fundamentally
                    believe that the Thai- American relationship was sound and family close. Since
                    World War II, we had been through a lot together, but the coup brought new
                    actors to the Thai stage that didn't share this history or camaraderie. A new
                    American ambassador was coming at a time when the Thai were feeling very sore
                    from this bruising that they had inflicted upon themselves and they looked to
                    the U.S. for support and encouragement of their new democratic direction.
                    American attitudes toward the coup were important because many young Thai
                    leaders and the Thai academic community were once students in the U.S. So
                    American approval was important, especially because no one was certain what the
                    Thai military would do in the wake of the change in government. The new
                    government was not necessarily effective. Strikes and demonstrations continued,
                    inconveniences mounted. The new government was supposed to be kind, not
                    effective. That is what Sanya was noted for, his judicial equanimity, Buddhist
                    scholar in his spare time, close to the king, somebody who would just stand
                    there and by virtue of his presence make people feel good and sit down. But, the
                    insecurities grew. Anyway, the Thai public, the students, the government and the
                    military looked for a sign from the United States. The Thai public, the
                    students, the newly vocal commentators wanted that sign to be an approving
                    one.</p>
                <p>Into this uncertain environment appeared a new, politically appointed ambassador
                    with a military background. Many Thai saw this as a chilling American commentary
                    on their recent overthrow of a military government. The ambassador would have to
                    handle considerable skepticism about the direction of American policy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: William Kintner, who probably had some Vietnam

                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Ambassador Kintner was a 1940 West Point graduate who served until he
                    retired from active duty in 1961. I believe he was an artillery officer, because
                    he was hard of hearing. After his retirement he held an academic appointment at
                    the University of Pennsylvania's Foreign Policy Research Institute which some in
                    Bangkok in 1973 considered a conservative think tank overly concerned with cold
                    war issues. The ambassador was co-author with Robert Strausz-Hup� and others on
                    a 1959 book entitled Protracted Conflict: A Challenging Study of Communist
                    Strategy. The eyes of the moderate Thai reformers saw a cold war warrior, with a
                    military background, coming to Thailand just when the civilians had thrown the
                    military out. Some Thai groups interpreted his appointment as a sign that the
                    United States wanted the military to come back. Given the fluid situation in
                    Thailand, suspicions of the new leaders made the ambassador's tour a delicate
                    and difficult assignment. The ambassador's image became a diplomatic problem for
                    the smooth execution of American foreign policy. In this case, the fact that
                    Ambassador Kintner was politically-appointed worked to his disadvantage, because
                    it made the Thai focus on his background and give consideration to what he
                    'represented.' A career Foreign Service officer would have been more 'neutral'
                    in local eyes because an FSO represented not his personal background and
                    political mentors, but his country. Unfortunately, the ambassador had other
                    personal characteristics that contributed to a rocky job performance. In fact,
                    his tour was cut short. We understood that the Royal Thai Government signaled
                    that his presence was not beneficial to a continued productive relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is pretty unusual.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: It is extremely unusual. Thailand was never a Western colony and had the
                    self-confidence to bend with the times - up to a point. But, in fact, the
                    ambassador had seriously erred in the Royal presence. His conduct in other ways
                    was very frustrating for Thai officials. For example, as an artillery officer he
                    was deaf in one ear and therefore he spoke in a tone of voice loud enough so
                    that he could hear himself; that meant he was shouting. So, dinner parties at
                    the ambassador's residence — which were the vehicles for building friendship,
                    looking over the talented officials, gauging the direction of Thai policies —
                    became painful occasions as the ambassador sat at his end of the table speaking
                    in a dominating voice. You couldn't talk to your neighbor under these
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>The background to these events, of course, was that Thailand was starting a new
                    uncharted course into the stormy waters attendant with the reconstitution of
                    parliamentary democracy. As an officer in the internal reporting unit of the
                    Political Section, my responsibilities were to monitor and analyze the student
                    movement and the new Parliament. Because of the fluid political environment of
                    the time, this was by far the choicest portfolio. My portfolio put me in the
                    unusual position of having CIA colleagues come to me for information or
                    introductions to the student activists!</p>

                        beethere six years or so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: I'm not certain the issue is whether Ambassador Unger was a difficult
                    act to follow as a politically appointed ambassador, or whether Ambassador
                    Kintner was just the wrong person with the wrong talents at the wrong time. When
                    he arrived we were looking forward to easing his transition with briefing papers
                    on the culture and politics of Thailand and whatever else it took. It was clear
                    early on, however, that he did not perceive the American Foreign Service
                    professionals as part of his team. This attitude cut him off from our feedback.
                    And things began to snowball. When your Thai contacts tell you, beg you, not to
                    be invited to the ambassador's residence, this was terribly, terribly unusual.
                    For their own reasons the Thai weren't even willing to sit through a normal
                    rotation and they actually came to us in a very covert way and asked for
                    relief.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like some of these problems could have been
                        anticipated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: I suppose it depends on your focus. Most politically-appointed
                    ambassadors are chosen for domestic reasons, not foreign policy reasons. To that
                    extent you are gambling that the receiving country has the stability and
                    maturity to allow you to ignore its needs while fulfilling your domestic needs.
                    In this case, Kintner would have had less of a problem if the military regime
                    had not been overthrown. When he was nominated for the position and approved by
                    Congress, the needs of the Nixon Administration may have been to 'shore up' our
                    image in Congress and Southeast Asia in the wake of our slow withdrawal from
                    Vietnam. It is ironic that if we were in Vietnam to support the forces of
                    democracy, those very democratic forces in Thailand complicated the job of
                    Ambassador Kintner.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, Ambassador Kintner had other traits that complicated his tour
                    and discomforted the Thai. I later learned that a visiting delegation from
                    Pennsylvania questioned whether Ambassador Kintner had the proper disposition
                    for this position. The DCM, Ed Masters, kept this information to himself and, in
                    fact, took the opposite tack with us. He told us privately and in staff meetings
                    that we had a great opportunity to demonstrate our professionalism to a
                    politically-appointed ambassador. We were excited to have this opportunity to
                    demonstrate the talents of the Foreign Service. Masters was smart.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes, that would be Charlie Whitehouse who came down froVientiane.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he was quite different?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Ah, Ambassador Whitehouse was different from anybody else I had ever
                    seen at that time. He was seemed from a different era. His father was a Foreign
                    Service officer. The ambassador was born in Paris, I believe. He struck me as
                    patrician, correct, old school.</p>
                <p>The arrival of Charles Whitehouse changed the atmospherics in terms of the
                    embassy's relationship with the Thai government and society and within the
                    embassy. By then, the embassy and the Thai had gone through quite a bit together
                    between the coup in October, 1973 and his arrival in late 1975. I left shortly
                    after he arrived.</p>
                <p>We had gone through one or two parliamentary elections. The public regarded the
                    Sanya Government as an indecisive civilian government. On the other hand, Thai
                    reformers and knowledgeable elites looked to us for that welcome hug that
                    everything was going to be okay. If Ambassador Unger knew everybody, Ambassador
                    Whitehouse started at square one. Ambassador Whitehouse ran a more formal
                    mission and rebuilt a more formal relationship with the Thai government. In
                    retrospect, I think that his strategy was helpful at the time—let's start
                    correctly and become friendly later on. But the relationship went through
                    additional strains at that time.</p>
                <p>In the spring of 1975, Saigon fell. The Thai were fairly confident that they
                    would survive, they had survived the Japanese and weren't too worried. But
                    shortly after the fall of Saigon was the USS Mayaguez incident. Because the
                    United States ordered armed aircraft to fly from Thai bases and attempt to
                    rescue the crew, many Thai saw our response as a blatant violation of Thai
                    sovereignty. The civilian government at that time was upset with the United
                    States. Concerned about the fragility of democratic government in Thailand, the
                    civilian administration saw this as an incident in which it was made to look
                    impotent and ineffective. Thai democratic forces were trying to strengthen their
                    case with their public and were concerned we were undercutting them. There were
                    some in the embassy who shared the Thai concerns.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: That's right, they had not. That would come later. There would be
                    another confrontation between the students and the military in 1976. That
                    confrontation forced some student leaders to join the guerrillas in the bush.
                    Later, the insurgency collapsed. The students were uncomfortable in the jungle,
                    the Chinese withdrew their support, the Vietnamese were occupied elsewhere and
                    the insurgency always lacked a claim to Thai nationalism.</p>

                <p>REUTHER: That was the spring of 1975. There was an opening because the incumbent
                    was due long postponed leave and transfer. One of the values of a small
                    constituent post is to provide training for young officers. The DCM's invitation
                    to gain a little management experience at this one-officer consulate was a rare
                    honor. The Songkhla consulate had political and economic reporting
                    responsibilities - there was a Moslem based ethnic insurgency along the
                    Malaysian border - and it coordinated USIA programs with local universities. It
                    was a fascinating 10 weeks.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: That is right. The temporary sojourn to Songkhla turned out to be more
                    exciting than my young family, complete with infant daughter, originally thought
                    because we were there when Saigon fell on April 30, 1975. At the time the
                    embassy informed me that Washington had announced we had evacuated all the
                    people for whom we were responsible out of Saigon. So, if anybody showed up on
                    the beach, we were not to approach these refugees, make any contact or otherwise
                    communicate to the Thai that we had any responsibility towards these people. The
                    issue wasn't that we were just washing our hands of the Vietnamese, but there
                    obviously were going to be large numbers of different kinds of people arriving
                    and we didn't want to close our options, if you will, by creating the
                    presumption with the Thai Government that we would take care of each and every
                    refugee. So, my orders were to stay away from them.</p>
                <p>Within three days, boatloads of people began arriving. Shortly, there were large
                    numbers of people on the Thai beaches. My instructions not to become involved
                    didn't prevent me from enlisting the assistance of the local missionaries, a
                    couple of Americans and a couple of Swiss. The missionaries had already taken
                    the initiative to minister to the humanitarian needs of this refugee population
                    in the makeshift camps the Thai arranged. I indicated that, if the missionaries
                    came across any identifying papers or information that the Vietnamese wanted to
                    pass on, I would take them. For about three weeks, list of names and U.S.
                    government identification numbers dominated reporting cables from Songkhla to
                    the embassy. Fairly dull reporting compared to the insurgency in the northeast
                    or parliamentary elections, but my DCM later said that Songkhla's reporting
                    played a crucial role in focusing Washington on the fact that we had residual
                    responsibilities toward these people and that the numbers involved were
                    significant.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: I would presume so. I had moved on by then. My reporting, indicating
                    that there were Vietnamese employees in the refugee stream, was the first such
                    concrete evidence. That reporting contributed to the establishment of a refugee
                    program.</p>

                <p>REUTHER: Yes, a lot of traveling to the provinces, talking to the police,
                    governors. There was an ethnic Malay insurgency in this area. At the peak of the
                    Thai dynasty's power and just before the Europeans arrived, Thailand had
                    expanded down the peninsula with the result that the last four Thai administered
                    provinces were predominately ethnic Malay. An insurgency, with antecedents in
                    the communist anti-British emergency, continued to sputter. Our interest was the
                    impact of the insurgency on political and economic developments, Thailand's
                    modernization, and the effectiveness of the Thai bureaucracy in delivering
                    services.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your consular district went down to the border of
                        Malaysia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: That's right. The consular district stretched from Nakhon Si Thammarat
                    to Pattani in the south. Tin mining was a major industry and tourism was
                    growing. One of the Democrat Party parliamentarians that I had met in Bangkok
                    represented a province in the Songkhla consular district and we continued our
                    close relationship when I was in Songkhla. As I prepared to depart Thailand at
                    the end of my tour, he presented me with a large painting in appreciation of the
                    year and a half we had worked together. I was very pleased to see that, twenty
                    years later, he became the prime minister. At that time we were both young men
                    starting our respective careers. In the early 1970s although the Democrat Party
                    had the largest block in the Parliament and was the oldest organized political
                    party in Thailand, no one believed it could come to power. There was serious
                    animosity between it and the military. There are two lessons here. First, every
                    country experiences political change over time and the internal dynamics may
                    move in unexpected directions. Second, the United States is well served if the
                    Foreign Service has the resources to take advantage of the future by meeting
                    another country's potential leaders before they get to the capital. It seems to
                    me that, in countries of particular interest to the U.S., the Foreign Service
                    ought to have a core of officers who have the appropriate language skills and
                    who experience a country in their first or second tour and then return ten years
                    later. So, you would have a political officer, or an economic officer, who was
                    an old acquaintance of someone who is now the minister of finance, etc. There is
                    no better way of creating acceptance for American policy than a familiar face.
                    Friends are cultivated, not commanded into existence.</p>
                <p>Q: I think your experience was good and significant but also unique to have
                    essentially your first five years devoted to one country with language training,
                    and service in a consulate and then the embassy.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>REUTHER: I think what you are seeing is that I was the beneficiary of some
                    excellent senior officers who took seriously their roles as mentors. I remember
                    at the end of my tour in Udorn writing to Personnel in Washington saying, “Gee,
                    I would like to stay here. I'd like the job opening up in the political
                    section,” and Washington not being encouraging at all. I mentioned this to the
                    DCM and he made it happen. He also provided the Songkhla opportunity. When I
                    later assumed supervisory responsibilities, I included in my vision mentoring as
                    well as directing.</p>
                <p>There were many lessons I took from my first two tours. I was struck by the
                    consequences of congressional antagonism toward the Foreign Service reflected in
                    our strange financial situation. The diplomat's skill is the skill of developing
                    a human relationship, friendship. Friends are cultivated, not ordered up. There
                    isn't a society that doesn't associate food with friendship — except when it
                    comes to performing the business of the American public. What I am thinking of
                    are embassy representation funds. You have to understand that we had a 13 person
                    political section and our entire representational budget, for the political
                    section of the second largest American embassy, was $1500. For comparison, each
                    officer in the New Zealand embassy's political section had $1500 for his own
                    representation. Yes, each New Zealand officer had the same amount of money
                    allocated to the entire American 13 person political section. Our individual
                    share of the section's allocation was insignificant, meaning to perform our
                    employer's requirements of developing contacts and meeting our host government
                    counterparts, we would have to pay for it from our meager junior officer pay. If
                    Congress's paradigm that Foreign Service officers were independently wealthy
                    were true, then this parsimony would be understandable. But that stereotype died
                    years ago and was but an embarrassing hardship for the vast majority of the
                    junior officers whose background was middle class, state university.</p>
                <p>I solved my problem by teaming with a colleague at the New Zealand embassy. He
                    had representational funds, but didn't have Thai language. We both had
                    responsibility for following parliamentary issues. He would pay for the lunch, I
                    would chat with the Thai parliamentarians, and then we would share notes later.
                    We would write up one set of notes and file them with our respective capitals.
                    But, it still seems strange to me that the New Zealand government paid for my
                    contact work in Bangkok.</p>
                <p>Q: At the end of your time in Thailand you went back to the United States. Is
                    there anything else you would like to say about that period in Bangkok or
                    Thailand?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: No, I think we have covered everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It looks as if you went back to your first

                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>REUTHER: It was another bit of serendipity. Although I enjoyed political
                    reporting, I realized that reporting on countries in the midst of political
                    development and modernization required understanding economic forces. Even
                    though I had a comprehensive exposure to economics as an undergraduate, I was
                    eager to enroll in FSI's six-month course in economics. I lobbied heavily for
                    that assignment, despite negative noises from central personnel, and finally
                    succeeded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That would have been January, 1976?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That course was described as the equivalent of an under
                        graduatmajor in economics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes. The same courses as an undergraduate major, but much more intense.
                    Some courses covered in one week material normally presented over a semester. It
                    was a bear of a course, as advertised. I thought the course was absolutely
                    fabulous. The staff FSI organized to teach these courses was utterly fascinating
                    and delivered the most stimulating lectures that you have ever come across. FSI,
                    in fact, has an excellent academic reputation. I recall that when we took the
                    area study course in preparation for going to Thailand, FSI enlisted Joseph
                    Campbell, who later would be all the rage on television, with a series I
                    believed entitled The Power of Myth.</p>
                <p>So, I survived the economics course. The professional requirement for completing
                    this prestige course was accepting an economics-designated job. You will recall
                    that at that time State Department organized its officers into cones -
                    political, economic, consular, and administration - for assignment and promotion
                    purposes. I exited Thailand as a political cone officer. One of the benefits
                    from the economics course was that I also became an economic cone officer. This
                    came in handy later when bidding on jobs. Not only did I improve my job
                    prospects via taking the economics course, but I was most fortunate to find an
                    onward assignment in Washington in a desk job in the Near East Bureau, the Iraqi
                    desk. I eagerly took that assignment, not only as a price for the course, but
                    also because I believed that a strong career development program involved being
                    familiar with the work of two regional bureaus.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: The Office Director, Morris Draper, wanted a strong desk, so within a
                    short period of time I embarked upon an orientation tour which included stops in
                    the Gulf, Bahrain, Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, and then up to Baghdad and on to
                    Jordan. Not only was I coming in contact with a new bureau, but also a whole new
                    topography. You have to understand I had just departed steamy Southeast Asia and
                    my hometown is the western part of Washington State, which is called the
                    Evergreen State. To go to a real desert was just amazing. We've all seen the
                    pictures, but that doesn't mean you understand the reality.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: The language demand for a Washington desk job is different from being in
                    the field. A Washington position is primarily an analytical, policy management
                    and coordinating job. In reality, the Iraq Desk job was supposed to be a
                    somnolent introduction to desk duties. As luck would have it, another Lebanese
                    civil war started. This event consumed the talents of the office director and
                    everybody else in the office. Although a Middle East novice, circumstances thus
                    required that I also cover economic and political issues involving Iraq, Jordan
                    and Syria.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did we reopen the embassy in Baghdad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Our typical experience in the Middle East is that during an Arab-Israel
                    war, the Arabic countries break diplomatic relations with the U.S. After a
                    decent pause, we return with a scaled down mission called an Interest Section
                    which is technically under a protecting power and usually housed in our former
                    building. In time, diplomatic relations are restored and the embassy again flies
                    an American flag. This cycle began again with the 1972 war. By the mid-1970s
                    most embassies had been restored; except Baghdad. This was Baghdad's way of
                    demonstrating disagreement with the other Arab powers. When I was the Iraqi Desk
                    officer, 1976-78, our Baghdad mission remained an interest section. Ed Peck was
                    the chief of the mission and David Mack his deputy. It would not become an
                    embassy until Iraqi's desperate days during its war with Iran.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>A Washington desk job is fundamentally different from a job in the field and
                    calls on a different set of skills. A major focus is policy coordination, which
                    exposes you to working with other U.S. government agencies. You seek
                    understanding of State's perspective, gather an understanding of the other
                    agencies' needs, and hammer out American policy.</p>
                <p>Q: When you came fresh and new to a job in Washington it was often more
                    demanding, more challenging, more difficult to establish yourself than in an
                    embassy abroad because in an embassy you were an important part of the only
                    American embassy in town, but in the Washington policy arena you were only one
                    of many and you have to deal with stereotypes of your agency and it takes a
                    while to establish your credentials and be able to get something done.</p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes. Also, I think, a Washington desk job probably requires you to cover
                    a variety of more detailed, specific subjects, very briefly. If you are working
                    in the internal section of the embassy in Bangkok you are the parliament officer
                    covering political parties. You're not reporting about what the military is
                    doing, or what the drug scene is. But, on the desk on any one day, you are
                    working with the Economic Bureau on a grain sale, or working with the FBI on a
                    technical legal issue. The Iraqis at that time smuggled machine pistols made in
                    Florida out of the U.S. in their diplomatic pouch, so I had a delightful time
                    working with the CIA, the FBI, and Customs. After months of pressure the Iraqis
                    returned all but one of the 10 pistols.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You also have to work with the Iraqi interest section
                        iWashington. Were they in the Swiss embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Actually they were in their own building, flying the Swisflag because
                    Switzerland was the designated protecting power.</p>
                <p>Q: But in many ways establishing rapport with lots of different people was
                    probably as important as understanding the least nuance of what was happening in
                    Iraq.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>REUTHER: The mark of the domestic assignment over a foreign assignment was the
                    need to work closely and productively with a variety of domestic agencies.
                    Because of various embargoes against Iraq, I worked closely with Treasury, for
                    example. And of course, because of the situation in Lebanon, I also had
                    extensive contact with embassies of other countries. For example, we were trying
                    to establish a reasonable dialogue with Syria on Middle East peace issues. As
                    part of encouraging a dialogue and making ourselves more transparent, we offered
                    the Syrian Foreign Minister access to Walter Reed for a medical checkup. He was
                    having very serious problems that he didn't want to become public, so he didn't
                    want to go to a Syrian doctor. In time I found myself with the Syrian ambassador
                    sitting in a waiting room at Walter Reed. I remember that circumstance vividly
                    because during the course of our confinement I found the ambassador to be a very
                    cultured gentleman. But as we spoke I noticed that he was scribbling on a legal
                    yellow pad. I thought he was making notes for some future meeting. When he
                    finished he handed me the page. It was a sketch of me. I framed it and still
                    have it. His foreign minister safe, the ambassador could relax. You can't make
                    too much of a pleasant human moment, but creating such moments was important in
                    possibly changing the atmospherics of political relations.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, there are aspects of diplomats that one doesn't suspect. Jordan, also,
                    was obviously a very important country to the United States. We had a fully
                    established embassy there in Amman and, I suppose, in Damascus, but not in
                    Baghdad?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes. In fact, the Iraqis wanted to play it that way because that was
                    their policy objective vis-a-vis the other Arabs. They wanted to be the tough
                    guy, the last to normalize. Iraqi policy was to influence, if not dominate,
                    intra-Arab debate on policy toward Israel by being obstinate. We were not
                    deterred by such bravado. Our policy was not so much to 'get along' with Iraq as
                    it was to give the other Arab countries cover to engage in productive
                    discussions with Israel, by creating the image of a steady normalization of
                    U.S.-Iraq relations. To that extent presenting an image that relations with
                    Baghdad were better than they were, or at least not as bad as Iraq wanted to
                    present them were our minimalist foreign policy goal. Of course, Baghdad's
                    stance meant it would not be very cooperative. We wanted to repair our building
                    and they made it very difficult. By ignoring the bravado and tenaciously
                    overcoming obstacles we watered down the benefits of such intransigence.</p>

                        1978 anyou moved up to the Secretary's Office?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>REUTHER: That is right. I moved to the Secretariat Staff (S/S-S), the office that
                    supported the Secretary. In Washington our responsibility was to manage the
                    paper flow; while traveling, we coordinated the Secretary's schedule and
                    communications with the embassy. We were organized into eight teams, one officer
                    and one secretary to each team. When the Secretary traveled, at minimum, two
                    teams would accompany him. One team would be on duty at all times and the other
                    stand down. Most trips during this period involved some advance planning. In
                    that case one team would precede the Secretary and assist the embassy with the
                    required preparations. The other team would travel with the Secretary. The team
                    that was in place on arrival would take over and those who traveled with him
                    would try to get some rest. It was a very brutal, physical existence of numerous
                    time zones, uptight embassies, and exacting demands. At that time tours in S/S-S
                    were mandated to be only one year, because they just exhausted people so
                    quickly. And, we had it easy. There were stories still being told about S/S-S
                    teams during the Kissinger years and of working such demanding hours that people
                    fell asleep while copying documents on the aircraft.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time you were there it was Cyrus Vance, who was
                        verdifferent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: That's right. A lawyer by training, self-confident, Secretary Vance knew
                    how to get the best out of people with a light touch, as far as I saw.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did several trips with the Secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Several trips, again concentrated on the Middle East. This was the Camp
                    David period so Middle East issues were very hot and heavy at that time. Of the
                    eight trips that I took that year, six of them were to the Middle East. The
                    normal circumstance was that the Secretary's travel was planned in advance. On
                    those occasions, we were responsible for tasking the desks that covered his
                    destinations for briefing papers. You know he is going to see the King of
                    Jordan, so what do you want him to say, what is the background, maps, historical
                    material. We would collect such papers into briefing books, distribute them and
                    in this way the Secretary and his party were prepared. There were other, more
                    hectic trips. Once we only had 12 hours notice. We were told in the morning that
                    we were leaving that evening. This is 1979, i.e., all pre-word processor and
                    whatnot, the days when you had real secretaries, and none of the desks could
                    draft the normal volume under such a short deadline, although they could pull
                    together the latest things they had done. So, literally we took the assistant
                    secretary, a couple of deputy assistant secretaries and a couple of office
                    directors, and tossed them on the plane and they dictated the briefing material
                    as we proceeded across the Atlantic to the Azores, and on to Cairo and the rest
                    of the trip. I remember going to the back of the plane where the press was
                    located and borrowing a small, portable, manual typewriter as I lent my fingers
                    to the task of turning edited drafts into clean copy. We were up all night. We
                    left Washington about 8:00 p.m. and flew through the night typing and dictating
                    away, an incredible thing. Of course, the Secretary was in the back of the plane
                    sleeping. Somebody had to be alive at the end of the trip. Seemed natural that
                    it should be him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you travel some with the Deputy Secretary too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes, one trip to Paris when the Deputy Secretary attended an OECD
                    economic summit. At that time Secretary Vance was in Moscow so both ranking
                    officials were out of the country. I particularly remember this assignment
                    because it was my only official trip to Paris. From Moscow Secretary Vance
                    decided on short notice that he would attend a NATO meeting in Portugal.
                    Consequently, I was detached from Paris and sent to Portugal to advance Lisbon
                    for him. This opportunity expanded my horizons because my personal focus on Asia
                    would otherwise have left no time for a tour to Portugal. I remember being
                    struck by the fact that, right across from the embassy, was an exquisite Chinese
                    restaurant and then thought, “Of course, Macao, and all those explorers!”</p>
                <p>While with S/S-S, I went to Mexico City with President Carter and Secretary
                    Vance. That was the trip when the President fell ill. That was the first time I
                    worked with the White House; it wasn't a comfortable match. The White House
                    staff with which we had liaison wasn't professionally organized to the extent
                    that they refused to coordinate requirements and plans, yet demanded immediate
                    obedience to their every whim even if it was a minor staffer's touring needs. I
                    was embarrassed by such arrogance, particularly because it seemed to be systemic
                    rather than individual.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>Q: You certainly get a good overview from that perspective of the way the
                    Department works or doesn't work, you have to work with many different bureaus,
                    various under secretaries and their staffs.</p>
                <p>REUTHER: It is an excellent perch for career development. In my mentoring of
                    younger officers, I often referred to that progression: up-country reporting,
                    embassy reporting, desk and then being around the Seventh Floor (the Secretary's
                    suite), as a career path that everybody ought to experience. You do end up
                    seeing how information is handled, how the Department coordinates with other
                    agencies and what the Secretary needs. You can be out in the boonies, you can be
                    in embassies, and you can be on the desk for years without ever coming to a
                    realization of what the Secretary of State needs in some particular
                    circumstance.</p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Q: This is a second part of an oral history interview at the National Foreign
                    Affairs Training Center, the Association of Diplomatic Studies and Training with
                    David E. Reuther. It is being conducted on October 3, 1996 and I am Raymond C.
                    Ewing.</p>
                <p>David the other day we took your career up until approximately 1979. I would like
                    to go back and ask you a couple of questions that occurred to me later about
                    your time as desk officer for Iraq from 1976-78, in the light of subsequent and
                    very interesting events. You left in 1978 from that job, did you see anything on
                    the horizon relating to the war between Iraq and Iran? Was that something that
                    you and others were beginning to think about?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: Around 1979 I can't really recall anything that would have suggested a
                    future Iran-Iraq war. I have subsequently concluded that Saddam simply seized
                    the opportunity that opened when Iran made itself reprehensible to the rest of
                    the international community. Iran's seizure of the American embassy left it
                    quite isolated, not only diplomatically, but also militarily. Tehran antagonized
                    the very country upon which its primarily American-equipped military was
                    dependent. For Saddam then, Iran looked like easy pickings. But that was in the
                    future. At the time I was dealing with Iraq, both Baghdad and Tehran used
                    different Kurdish factions to harass each other. But, then that had been going
                    on for a years and in fact during the 1976-78 period there was a lull in this
                    activity.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>As to U.S. policy, the Carter Administration came to office in the middle of my
                    tour. Its basic thrust was that the United States should have diplomatic
                    relations with anybody, regardless of whether we approved of them. This policy
                    stressed that opening communications was key to reducing tension. Because, Iraq
                    was the last of the Middle East countries that had broken off relations as a
                    result of the 1972 war, the Administration sought to move Baghdad to a more
                    formal relationship as the first step to nullifying its opposition to a Middle
                    East peace. I think that is where our efforts were directed at that time, to
                    look for opportunities to establish some sort of dialogue with them, or at least
                    undercut Iraqi policy by creating the image that progress was being made. As I
                    mentioned, for Baghdad, a truncated relationship with the U.S. was a pillar of
                    its foreign policy. Iraq's position was that it was the last true Arab state,
                    the only protector of the Palestinians, that the Syrians had sold out and
                    established relations with the Americans. So, part of Baghdad's policy was no
                    official relationship with us; that is why our willingness to establish a
                    dialogue was a direct, albeit subtle, challenge to Iraq's policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My second question which you have already touched on
                        relates to the Kurds. I am curious as to what extent you as the desk officer
                        or the State Department had continuing contact with the various Kurdish
                        groups and how you did that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Well, actually we had had a rather intensive relationship with the Kurds
                    prior to my coming on the scene, as I understand it, and that relationship had
                    climaxed and was on the ebb, if you will. Mustafa Al-Barzani, of the Barzani
                    clan, was in the U.S. as were many of his clan members. Many of the older
                    Foreign Service officers with whom I worked had personal relations with the
                    Barzani Kurds that went back over the years. They kept a social relationship, so
                    I was included in entertainment at Barzani's house a couple of times here in the
                    Washington area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Finally, I wonder whether you perceived at that time any
                        threaby Iraq towards another neighbor, Kuwait?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: No. There wasn't anything in that time period that would have suggested
                    any danger for Kuwait. I don't recall Kuwait being the subject of special
                    condemnation or attention. As I said, the prime thrust of our policy was to move
                    to a more formal relationship, undercut Iraqi challenge any intra-Arab
                    inclination for peace talks, encourage a more responsible dialogue with Iraq,
                    and do that by making ourselves available. I think we licensed the sale of some
                    Boeing commercial aircraft at that time. On the other hand, when they become
                    difficult, we reciprocated. So, we had this whole incident of them smuggling
                    guns in their diplomatic pouch, catching them red-handed made our protests that
                    much more effective. That was basically what we were doing at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were the Iraq desk officer essentially before the
                        Iraniarevolution took place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: That is right. The Shah was still in power and we werstill on very close
                    and friendly relations with Iran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, there was no tilt towards Baghdad or the idea of
                        duacontainment or any of these things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Right. As a matter of fact, when you really look at it, Iraq was very
                    much a backwater in our efforts at that time because shortly after I came on
                    board, Lebanon blew up again. So, in this five-person office you had four
                    working on Lebanon; and I was covering Jordan, Syria and Iraq on a daily basis.
                    So, our whole focus, responding to the pressure of daily events was in a whole
                    different area. There was no tilt to Baghdad or containment.</p>
                <p>Because we are talking about the Carter Administration, we should note the
                    beginnings of strong American interest in the issue of human rights. During the
                    Carter administration, the State Department established the Bureau of Human
                    Rights. One of the consequences when you set up a new office is that you alter
                    the policy flow through the bureaucratic system: who has to be cleared with, who
                    has to be dealt with.</p>
                <p>In our effort to create the image of working toward establishing a normal
                    dialogue with Iraq, someone came up with the idea of presenting Saddam Hussein
                    with ornamental pistols as a gift. Intelligence said Saddam was an avid gun
                    collector. If he showed off American gift guns, he would be undercutting his own
                    policy. We became involved in long, complicated bureaucratic battles with the
                    Human Rights Bureau over this gesture. Of course, Iraq had a bad human rights
                    reputation and HR refused to sign off on the permission to provide this gift. In
                    retrospect, it appears to me that the traditional goal of diplomacy, and a goal
                    to which the Carter Administration seemed committed to, was the larger goal of
                    establishing a dialogue so that you can exert influence. The new world of human
                    rights ran counter to engagement. Dialogue was replaced by our requirement that
                    country X comply with our list of demands. There is no reason human rights can't
                    be part of a foreign affairs dialogue. As the movie Z about Greece portrayed,
                    some governments were carrying on some nasty activities. When you move from
                    'what you wish for' to 'what you can accomplish' priorities become an issue. In
                    the early days Pat Derian and her colleagues in the Bureau of Human Rights
                    demanded that human rights not be one issue among many priorities, but the
                    priority. Perhaps this was necessary to establish the Bureau's turf. The end
                    result for handling relations with Iraq was the Human Rights bureau strictly
                    limited our tools of engagement. The irony is that both the HR Bureau and
                    Baghdad were in agreement that the U.S. was not engaged in a constructive
                    dialogue with Iraq. An interesting irony.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, perhaps it would have been better if Saddam Hussein had gotten the
                    ornamental pistol, instead of some of the other weapons that he came to acquire
                    in the later period.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>Let's move ahead. After you left the Secretariat Staff, I believe you moved to
                    the Office of Chinese Affairs as an economic officer. Tell me a little bit about
                    that. That was a period from 1979-81, the end of the Carter Administration and
                    the beginning of Reagan Administration.</p>
                <p>REUTHER: While assigned to Secretary Vance's office, the Carter Administration
                    completed the task of normalizing diplomatic relations with China. The
                    Administration closely held this decision. The January 1979 normalization was as
                    much a surprise to many inside the Department as those outside. With
                    normalization came an expansion of officers assigned to the new Office of
                    Chinese and Mongolian Affairs and I was invited to join the China desk. At that
                    time, the China Desk Office Director was Chas Freeman. The office was divided
                    into two sections: political and economic. I was assigned to the economic half,
                    under Jerry Ogden, and had responsibility for Sino-American economic relations,
                    including export control issues and liaison with Murray Zinoman in OES (Bureau
                    of Oceans, Environment, and Science) on science and technology issues.</p>
                <p>Normalization presented an unprecedented opportunity. Chas Freeman, as you know,
                    was office director at that time and his oral history should be perused for
                    important guidance on this period. He is talented, a gifted linguist, and one of
                    the few officers involved in the initial breakthrough in the early 1970s.</p>
                <p>He had thought deeply about what it meant to reestablish relations with Beijing.
                    In addition to easily anticipated foreign policy issues, the State Department
                    itself had to prepare for the new relationship. One of the consequences for the
                    Foreign Service of the previous policy of only recognizing Taipei was that the
                    Taipei embassy provided a limited number of positions for Chinese language
                    speaking officers. The post- normalization Foreign Service, which would have to
                    staff an embassy and numerous consulates, needed language capable officers.
                    Checking with Personnel we determined that Chinese language training for younger
                    officers was one of the things that had lapsed over the years because of budget
                    circumstances, lack of need, and the unintended foreign policy signal training a
                    fair number of officers would have sent. There was a sizable number of older
                    officers with Chinese, but precious few younger officers. Even at that, the
                    Department had Chinese language slots in Manila, Bangkok, and Hong Kong, as a
                    method maintaining a cadre of Chinese speaking officers. With diplomatic
                    recognition, the numbers were totally inadequate, so one of Chas' first
                    objectives was to press Personnel and FSI for more Chinese language training. We
                    had an embassy and consulates to staff. Now, if one were just staffing a country
                    like Franc— where there are good newspapers, adequate roads, a modern
                    transportation system — an embassy and a consulate or two might be adequate to
                    understand national trends. But, China is a vast, continental, developing
                    country with primitive transportation and communication networks. So, if you
                    were to find out what was happening you had to be in those places. For
                    comparison, look at German or British embassy staffing in the continental United
                    States. The U.S. is a modern, sophisticated country and excellent media
                    facilities, yet the Europeans just don't rely on an embassy in Washington, but
                    have the United States covered by numerous consulates.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In that period when you were just starting, did we already
                        havsome consulates?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: No, those were post-normalization objectives.</p>
                <p>Q: How about on the economic trade side. Was there much business community
                    interest? Were you involved in negotiating agreements? Were you analyzing the
                    Chinese economy? What sort of work did you do?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: All of the above. The establishment of diplomatic relations meant
                    replacing the previous tight embargo with trade. To answer the question what
                    sort of market might China be, one of the first things we did was to commission
                    our in-house Intelligence and Research Bureau to conduct some studies for us. I
                    remember one of the questions put to them was, if China were to acquire a
                    telephone network equivalent to Italy or Spain, mid- level European, what would
                    it require? The answer was that it would require the world's production of
                    copper for the next five years to wire China like a mid-level European country.
                    Obviously, if China bought all of the world's copper, prices would skyrocket.
                    So, it was to the U.S. advantage not to have this largest, last, undeveloped
                    country setting traditional modernization goals. Fortunately, satellite
                    technology was at hand, but if the stringent export control laws scared away
                    U.S. business, we would have no commercial relationship, a weak Chinese economy,
                    and potential supply and price problem in the international economy. With this
                    in mind then, we encouraged American companies to consider offering satellite
                    technology.</p>
                <p>Of course, such an effort collided with the encrusted export control laws that
                    applied to China. Over the previous 30 years, many a freshman congressman
                    demonstrated his anti- Communist mettle by sponsoring anti-Chinese legislation.
                    The result hardly left any room for any significant trade. There was a need to
                    communicate both to the Congress and the business community that the government
                    was serious about encouraging trade. Our office drafted speeches and sought
                    fora, such as the U.S.-China Business Relations Council, to communicate that the
                    U.S. Government supported trade and encouraged business to sell items for which
                    it earlier could not obtain export licenses.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>At the time of normalization our export control laws placed China and the Soviet
                    Union in one category, Yugoslavia, in recognition of Tito's break with Stalin,
                    in another. Written this way, the law assumed that the Chinese would potentially
                    divert any purchase to Moscow, and that any sale to China, became a precedent
                    for a sale to the Soviet Union. One of the most acrimonious aspects of
                    interagency implementation of the new relationship with China was overcoming
                    these presumptions. The whole geopolitical basis of the opening to China was
                    that Washington and Beijing were anti-Soviet! To Chas and others it was obvious
                    that if other bureaucracies dragged their feet implementing existing export
                    control regulations, then trade with China was problematic. In time, because of
                    our interagency delays, we rewrote the export control regulations to remove
                    China from the same category as the Soviet Union. The export control issue took
                    enormous amounts of our time as either we or our principles fought these issues
                    in interagency fora. In time, the Chinese realized little was coming out the
                    pipeline and at high level meetings we began to receive queries from the Chinese
                    as to this project or that computer. Two of the largest issues revolved around
                    the Landsat II Ground station and the Western Geophysical computer for oil
                    exploration. To State, China's economy was so needful that diversion to
                    non-economic purposes was a remote chance were we willing to take. Defense
                    fought us well into the next Administration. We tried to establish export
                    control guidelines for equipment, especially computers: typical graduations were
                    - some low level where U.S. companies threw stuff away (but above current
                    technical limits for sale to China); a low mid-range for which we wanted a
                    presumption of sale; and a high-mid range for which no presumption of sale was
                    warranted and every case reviewed individually.Even these attempts didn't
                    streamline our deliberations. I remember one seemingly simple case, I think it
                    was of a y level medical diagnostic equipment on which DOD kept stalling.
                    Finally, we tried to create a deadline and get a straight answer from them as to
                    the problem. Turned out that some Army lab in New Jersey owned the earlier
                    version of this equipment and wasn't about to approve it for sale to China until
                    they got the budget to buy a replacement for themselves! With the exposure that
                    the problem was not a level of technology issue, but a budget issue for that
                    lab, we obtained consensus for the sale. Export control remained a contentious
                    interagency issue.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q. How else did you go about building a relationship with
                        China?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>REUTHER: If the first element of our approach was to encourage U.S. business, the
                    second element was to demonstrate to the Chinese that the U.S. sought a full and
                    productive relationship. The trade embargo was only a symptom of the extent to
                    which the United States worked over the years to totally isolate China. While
                    China was a member of the UN after the early 1970s, it certainly was not a major
                    economic or international actor. It might have trade relations with France or
                    the United Kingdom, but let's face it, the United States is the premier world
                    power and American acceptance meant international acceptance in a manner China
                    had not enjoyed since 1949. So, one of our objectives was to look for areas in
                    which we could engage our two countries in responsible, normal, commercial, and
                    diplomatic endeavors. An analogy we used at the time was that there was great
                    hole in the ground that was a lack of Chinese contact with the U.S., and our job
                    was to fill that hole.</p>
                <p>So, we approached this task from a number of angles. China was still a
                    centralized economy dominated by significant bureaucracies. How to engage each
                    bureaucracy and give its personnel insights into the workings of a consumer
                    economy? China's association with European economies was insufficient experience
                    for it to connect with the American economy. The American economy was in the
                    midst of deregulation. Unlike the Europeans, we did not have a national airline,
                    or shipping company. We knew the U.S. economy would 'feel' different to the
                    Chinese.</p>
                <p>One of our first steps was to negotiate a maritime treaty, for example. That is a
                    fascinating little case study. The State Department's Economics Bureau has a
                    maritime office. Because of its specialized knowledge of maritime issues, it was
                    the lead negotiator for the American side. Of course, our delegation included
                    other government agencies with equities in this issue. There were
                    representatives from Defense, Transportation, Treasury, and others.</p>
                <p>With the negotiating team set, we invited the Chinese to Washington. Setting an
                    American venue was very important to us at that time because we wanted to use
                    this opportunity to increase the pool of Chinese officials who had visited the
                    U.S. The penalty for the years of no contact was that Chinese officials had
                    never seen the United States, had no idea how big it was, no idea of our
                    consumer economy and certainly little understanding of our technological
                    advancement. Nothing like an American hotel room or barbecue invitation to a
                    private home to underscore an important message. The Chinese may have visited
                    Europe, but if they only thought the United States was a little bit bigger than
                    France, or like Germany, then they weren't getting the whole picture. So, we
                    were quite eager to invite their teams here as an educational experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>In this vein you will recall that Deng Xiaoping came to the United States in
                    early 1979. I had not yet taken up my Chinese Desk assignment, but my
                    understanding is that our organization of his schedule was designed to educate
                    him about the size and variety of the U.S. I believe his schedule had him
                    stopping in Hawaii first, and then on to Washington. From there he went to Texas
                    and California. The point of the exercise was not for him to come into the West
                    Coast and do serially West Coast, Texas, Washington and maybe out through Europe
                    or something like that. We wanted him to fly across the United States twice
                    assuming that sitting in that plane five hours would give him a physical
                    understanding of the size and majesty of the United States.</p>
                <p>So, we began negotiating a maritime agreement. The first problem was our own
                    legislation which forbade port access to Soviet Bloc countries. But then, wasn't
                    that the key political-strategic factor, China was no longer a Soviet satellite?
                    Of course, in reviewing which ports we would offer to open, in close cooperation
                    with our colleagues at Defense, we undertook a considerable effort to balanced
                    commercial ports with those which may have had naval facilities adjacent to
                    them. We wanted a clear appreciation of our national security and economic
                    interests.</p>
                <p>The Chinese, for their own requirements, wanted the final list of Chinese and
                    American ports to be of equal length. This was not easy. The U.S. has three
                    coasts, China one. I remember collaborating with Navy representatives and
                    comparing size, water depth, etc. of the Chinese ports with our ports. It made
                    considerable economic sense for Los Angeles to be on our list and Darien to be
                    on theirs. For face purposes, the two lists of posts are equal, but their list
                    included ports of no particular interest to us because they were too small for
                    U.S. merchant vessels. Nevertheless, we also believed the Chinese port list
                    reflected a signal from the central government to the local governments, and the
                    country as a whole, that opening the country to foreign trade was government
                    policy. Considering the Qing Dynasty efforts to thwart western trade 140 years
                    earlier, the openness of the Chinese position and its connection with its own
                    domestic reform was remarkable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they equally interested in the Gulf coast as well as
                        thWest Coast?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: At the time a primary product in Sino-American trade was American grain.
                    Economic reform in China coincided with an extraordinary decision to feed the
                    Chinese coastal cities with imported grain. It was cheaper and unburdened the
                    Chinese rail system. So the mouths of the Mississippi and the Columbia rivers
                    were of interest. In terms of industrial trade, of course, Beijing sought access
                    to the southeast and southwest coasts. Part of our objective was to build
                    bridges with the Chinese and overcome the years of separation. In addition to
                    problem solving, we wanted to create scenarios where they would have to talk to
                    us, have to visit us, exchange with us, begin to understand our requirements,
                    the unique aspects of the U.S. market, etc.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>The other economic issue of high priority for us was an aviation agreement. An
                    aviation agreement provided immediate economic and cultural benefits for
                    American business, tourists and academics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Deregulation had started?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes, deregulation of the American market had started. Between our
                    deregulation and the Chinese, like all of Europe, with its national flag
                    carrier, we entered these negotiations from two different perspectives. The
                    Chinese already had negotiated a number of civil aviation agreements with Japan
                    and the Europeans by the time their high- ranking team came to Washington.
                    Again, the Department's Economics Bureau, which had an aviation office, headed
                    the American delegation. As with the maritime agreement, the Department of
                    Transportation, Treasury, FAA, and the military were involved.</p>
                <p>During these negotiations I heard one of the best advertisements for Boeing
                    airplanes that I have heard in years. During the 1972-79 period, we allowed the
                    Chinese to fly commercial aircraft into the United States on a one-time basis,
                    if they had a U.S. military crewman in the cabin. One of these officers was the
                    Air Force representative to our civil aviation delegation. He told of one
                    flight, which he said was typical of the minimal skills of the Chinese pilots,
                    into Los Angeles. He swore that when the aircraft was five feet off the ground,
                    the Chinese pilot reversed the engines and the plane fell onto the runway. The
                    landing gear absorbed this tremendous impact and nothing untoward happened.
                    After that experience, this air force captain said he loved Boeing quality.And
                    there were other stories. When the Chinese were going to New York in those days,
                    they had no experience with heavy traffic and the requirement to circle, waiting
                    one's turn to land. Normally, New York air traffic controllers create two stacks
                    of airplanes to safely separate the aircraft and prioritize landings. The
                    Chinese pilots' inexperience with these procedures created a special burden for
                    New York air traffic controllers. Apparently it got to the point that, when the
                    Chinese aircraft arrived, the air traffic controllers pulled all the stacks away
                    from New York, brought him down, and then returned to normal procedures. This
                    story, however, isn't about safety. Its about Chinese inexperience with a
                    commercial economy and the multiple ways in which we could develop a productive
                    relationship with China. We believed it was to our advantage to expose them to
                    how we handled these kinds of problems. China and the United States, as large
                    continental economies and therefore have a great deal in common, particularly
                    the scale of the economic and social issues we both face. Our problems are on a
                    much more vast scale than those facing the Europeans.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>Civil aviation was another venue for an interaction in which standards and
                    technical parameters would be exchanged, and ultimately the benefits of American
                    equipment and procedures extolled. At that moment, the Chinese commercial
                    aviation was in its infancy, few planes were in the air, safety relied on the
                    lack of planes in the air. The Chinese piloting experience was to get airborne,
                    be assigned a very small slice of air space (by the military which controlled
                    the sky), get to his destination and be brought down. Every time we exposed them
                    to our system, we were educating, building expectations.</p>
                <p>The civil aviation negotiations were interesting because the Chinese brought with
                    them their standard bilateral civil aviation agreement. It was quite inadequate
                    because it assumed both countries had national airlines. During our initial
                    meetings we explained at great length that there was no U.S. national airline.
                    We had numerous airline companies. We described how we allocated routes through
                    a bidding process. The Chinese were absolutely flabbergasted. How could a
                    country like the United States not have a national airline? In their lobbying
                    effort, the PanAm representatives took advantage of the Chinese presumption,
                    saying, in essence: “Don't listen to what the government guys tell you. We are
                    the U.S. national airline. Remember, we served China in the '30s...” In fact,
                    some of the officials in the Chinese aviation system were mechanics with PanAm
                    in the old days, so the PanAm name resonated. The prime American bidders for the
                    routes to China were PanAm and Northwest. PanAm gained an advantage with its
                    nostalgic presentation. The Chinese support for the PanAm bid, to the extent the
                    Chinese were unfamiliar with aviation trends in the U.S., in part reflected the
                    success of our embargo which kept them on the periphery of world trends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: PanAm and Northwest actually participated in the
                        discussions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: As with many of these negotiations, there is an official delegation and
                    industrial representatives. On one hand, the industrial representatives acted as
                    resources for our delegation, but did not participate in the bilateral
                    discussion. On they other, they had full access to the opposite delegation. They
                    hosted some of the meals, privately met with the Chinese delegation and made
                    their own presentations to them. It would be interesting to get the Chinese to
                    tell us what they thought of that whole thing.</p>
                <p>Our effort, again, was to try to educate them as to how we operated, why we had
                    so many airlines, why we were so big, how the whole thing worked, because we saw
                    these early meetings with China as methods to educate them as to what we were
                    about.</p>
                <p>Q: During this time did you have an opportunity to visit China, or were you
                    pretty much working on the interagency and negotiating side in Washington?</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Actually I took my first trip to China at that time. Included in my
                    portfolio of responsibilities was what we called science and technology
                    (S&amp;T). International cooperation in S&amp;T evolved from a concern for
                    controlling the technology of mass destruction and the budding environmental
                    movement. The White House had an S &amp; T office. During the Carter
                    Administration, Frank Press headed that office. The relevant State Department
                    organization was the Bureau for Oceans, Environmental and Scientific Affairs
                    (OES). Again, we saw scientific cooperation with the Chinese as a method of
                    contacting their educational system, generating immediate benefits for both
                    sides and subtly educating them about ourselves. Science and technology
                    exchanges with the Chinese were in fact a very major part of our bridge building
                    program. There was an umbrella S&amp;T agreement with China and under that there
                    were a large number of individual protocols which again sought to fill the void
                    between the two countries. Our objective was to reverse the many years of
                    suspicion and no contact.</p>
                <p>My first trip to Beijing was as the State Department escort officer to the annual
                    S&amp;T conference. The conference created a useful deadline for putting the
                    final touches on various agreements under negotiation and a ceremonial focus for
                    the overall relationship. As this was my first trip to a country I had studied
                    from afar, rather disparate images stand out today. The trip took place in
                    January a particularly cold month for northern China. We were invited to a piano
                    concert. The weather forced one to wear an overcoat in transit, but what I
                    didn't realize was that this vast, first-rate (to the Chinese) auditorium was
                    not heated. Absolutely everybody there looked like a buffalo wrapped up as best
                    as they could. The poor piano player was probably freezing his fingers off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The pianist wasn't wearing gloves.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: He should have, because it was cold. Beijing in the winter doesn't have
                    the snow of Minnesota but it has the winds and temperatures of the upper plains.
                    The other meteorological factoid that struck me at the time was the low
                    humidity. Any negotiation requires last minute changes and notifications to the
                    delegation. One day I was struggling with the embassy's copy machine which was
                    probably invented when Marshall was Secretary of State. The low humidity of the
                    Beijing winter meant that there wasn't enough moisture for the rollers to pick
                    up the paper. At times you had to breathe on the edge of the paper and then put
                    it onto the rollers. One page at a time. It really slows down your copying. Just
                    another illustration that good equipment doesn't get to the field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we have an ambassador then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes. Ambassador Woodcock.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who came from the labor union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Right, the UAW. He had a long time interest in China. In fact, with
                    normalization, things Chinese were all the rage. Major department stores, such
                    as Macy's, had exclusive sales of Chinese products and Chinese influenced
                    designs. It is interesting how Americans flock to fads. One day I took a phone
                    call from a major mid- West manufacturing company. The caller noted that his
                    boss recently finished a golf game during which he heard, at length, about his
                    partner's trip to China. Could we recommend even more exotic Chinese
                    destinations in preparation for the next golf game? One-upmanship in executive
                    travel, if you will, which is absolutely hilarious because China had meager
                    facilities for tourism at that time. It was all quite spartan. These and other
                    travelers had no idea of how desperately inadequate the Chinese facilities were
                    at the time. But, everybody had overly romanticized China.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, there had been a long period, of course, of estrangement between the
                    United States and China and to some extent China and the rest of the world...the
                    Cultural Revolution and all that long period...and certainly there was an
                    excitement at the thought of interacting with China. I can remember being on a
                    panel discussion with you, Dave, in January 1981, I think, and you were
                    stressing how important China was for the 1980s and the need for the Reagan and
                    Bush administrations to deal with some important issues with China. I was
                    talking a lot about Europe in the same panel but I think you were right that
                    China was on the front burner and should have been.</p>
                <p>Unless there is something else you want to say about that time as the economic
                    officer on the China desk, maybe we should move on to your next assignment,
                    which I believe was to the American Institute in Taiwan in 1981. I think you
                    were there for four years or so. You were chief of the political section. Would
                    you like to say something about the unique arrangement of the Institute not
                    being an embassy?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: Certainly a lot has been written about the way in which we organized
                    ourselves in 1979 to assure a proper relationship with Taipei. It appeared to me
                    that the Japanese precedent was in the minds of the American players. The
                    Japanese in 1972 recognized Beijing and established an unofficial office in
                    Taipei called the Japanese Interchange Office. Taipei had an unofficial office
                    in Tokyo. Taiwan used to be a Japanese colony. Taiwan and Japan had important
                    personal, business, and educational ties that they wanted to preserve. The
                    Japanese unofficial relationship worked. When we came on the same
                    decision-point, we saw an advantage to the precedent the Japanese had set. I
                    think there are minor differences, reflecting unique aspects of our law and
                    customs. We told Beijing in our negotiations that we were going to do this and
                    whatever their objections they would just have to table them. Beijing may not
                    have liked it, but it found the arrangement acceptable. So, coming out of
                    Washington I was first assigned to Chinese language training, 1981-83.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did that take place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: At that time language training was one year in Washingtoand then one
                    year in Taipei.</p>
                <p>Q: Now, you had already had some Chinese before, but you pretty much had to go
                    through the whole program because you didn't have any experience speaking.</p>
                <p>REUTHER: Exactly. My previous language training was in academia, which, because
                    American scholars couldn't go to China, was basically training for research
                    purposes. Diplomatic use of language necessarily assumes face to face
                    conversation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The second year was in Taiwan, in Taipei?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: In Taipei. By that time the language school, previously located in
                    Taichung in central Taiwan had moved to Taipei. The pre-normalization American
                    presence in Taiwan was extensive and included a fair military presence. There
                    could be no military presence under an unofficial relationship. The departure of
                    the military left us with this vast housing pool in Taiwan. Instead of having
                    facilities throughout Taiwan, we consolidated basic functions into the housing
                    area on Yangming Shan, a mountain in a northeastern suburb of Taipei.</p>
                <p>I finished the second year of language training in 1983 and took up my duties as
                    the Chief of the General Affairs Section of the American Institute on
                    Taiwan.</p>
                <p>Q: Dave, we got you out of language training and into the job at the American
                    Institute in Taiwan. You were there from 1983-85 and chief of the political
                    section. Tell me what sorts of things were going on in Taiwan in those days?
                    They were still, I'm sure reacting a bit to normalization of our relationship
                    with Beijing. Was that your primary focus or was it more internal political
                    developments within Taiwan itself?</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Actually there were a number of aspects to it. On the one hand our
                    primary mission, since we were still close emotionally to normalization, was to
                    make the idea of the unofficial relationship work. For their part, the
                    authorities on Taiwan spent all their time trying to prove to themselves and
                    their public that we had an official relationship. For two years we engaged in a
                    running game of thrust and parry with the local authorities. For example,
                    Taiwan's unofficial counterpart to AIT was the Coordination Council for North
                    American Affairs (CCNAA). It had an office in Washington (and other American
                    cities) and one in Taipei with which we conducted liaison as if it were the
                    “foreign ministry.” Publicly we were seen working with CCNAA which was housed in
                    a separate building a few blocks from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. In fact,
                    we worked closely with talented and patriotic officials at the Ministry of
                    Foreign Affairs, but in unofficial venues. At one point, for their domestic
                    reasons, the authorities on Taiwan told us that they would move CCNAA into
                    offices on the backside of the building that housed the Ministry of Foreign
                    Affairs. This would create a situation where, if you will, the address for the
                    ministry is 1500 Third Street, but the address for the opposite side of the same
                    building was 1500 First Street. Despite their arguments of efficiency and
                    obtuseness (the CCNAA and MFA addresses would be different), their intent was to
                    impart the appearance of officiality to the relationship. We begged them not to
                    tinker with the symbols of unofficiality, and they finally dropped this
                    idea.</p>
                <p>This game of imparting officiality into the relationship dominated the two years
                    I was in Taipei. Our objective was not to put Taiwan down. The reality was that
                    we could have as robust a relationship with Taiwan as we desired, as long as we
                    kept it unofficial, meaning out of the public eye. A public event would force
                    Beijing to notice; otherwise Beijing would turn a diplomatic blind eye.</p>
                <p>Taipei needed the appearance of officiality for the Kuomintang-dominated
                    government to justify its hold on power. The rationale for KMT rule was that it
                    was the government of all of China. In partial proof, there was a national
                    government on Taiwan and a provincial government. Because Taipei needed the
                    psychological boost of officiality, incidents arose from time to time where
                    Taipei would steal a march on us. After our long years of association, Taipei
                    was familiar with American practices and weaknesses. I recall one day seeing a
                    picture on the front page of the local newspaper of an American military
                    officer, in uniform, at a medical conference. The local authorities had invited
                    an officer from a military medical corps, at their expense, to a conference in
                    Taipei. They knew that in encouraging him to wear a uniform, a symbol of
                    sovereignty and hence sovereign recognition, the officer was violating U.S.
                    policy. My office spent the day calling the major hotels in town, tracking the
                    officer down, and getting him out of town. So, one mark on the wall for
                    them.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>Since 1979 the authorities on Taiwan sought to make the relationship as official
                    as possible, and we sought to maintain an unofficial relationship. The ultimate
                    audience for this thrust and parry was not the international community or
                    friends in America. At issue for the authorities on Taiwan was their domestic
                    legitimacy which they had tied to their claim to be the government of all of
                    China. For them these exchanges had an edge, yet I think both sides exhibited
                    professionalism and good humor. That's the point. It is the role of diplomacy to
                    manage disagreements and insure that small conflicts do not snowball into major
                    issues.</p>
                <p>In the early 1980s, the issue of the Republic of China's position in the Asian
                    Development Bank [ADB] was an illustration of the tension between the KMT and
                    the Taiwanese. Up to this time, the KMT position was that if its rival, the
                    People's Republic of China, joined an international organization, then the ROC
                    would leave. This made sense within the paradigm of the “One China” issue.
                    Neither the CCP or the KMT wanted to establish a circumstance in which both were
                    represented, no two Chinas, no one China, one Taiwan. Of course, this policy
                    left the KMT isolated internationally. The Taiwanese political opposition,
                    starting with the Presbyterian Church's declaration of 1972, argued that the
                    hardline KMT position was isolating the island. Moderate KMT forces were seeking
                    a way to undercut the Taiwanese criticism. So, domestic and international
                    politics came together over the status of the ROC in the ADB.</p>
                <p>Q: But what was the role of AIT in all this?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: Actually, we played a number of roles which are illustrative of what
                    foreign service work is all about. First, we did extensive reporting on how the
                    various factions in Taiwan thought about the representation issue at the ADB in
                    Manila. We talked to government officials, Taiwanese politicians, and business
                    people. Second, with Director Lilley in the head, AIT Taipei, we were making a
                    number of suggestions of how the issue of the ROC's representation could be
                    handled. This was important because there were actors on the U.S. side, in
                    Congress and in the Executive Branch, whose support of the KMT position
                    complicated the discussions. Ultimately, I think the KMT moderates won a major
                    victory. The ROC stayed in the ADB as “China, Taipei,” a formula that opened up
                    renewed ROC participation in a number of organizations and especially the
                    Olympics. But I don't think the record of the internal KMT debates is well
                    documented yet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Handling an issue such as ADB membership, didn't that
                        involvcontact with the authorities on Taiwan at the highest level?</hi>

                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>REUTHER: It certainly did and I think part of Director Lilley's contribution, and
                    our efforts in GAS, was to restore a productive association with the KMT. One
                    consequence of the change of relations in 1979, of course, was a much less
                    intimate relationship with the elite, the Kuomintang. I don't remember whether
                    the heads of the American Institute in Taiwan ever did see Chiang Ching-kuo, who
                    was the president at that time. By 1983 he was advanced in age and ill with
                    diabetes and other complications. As a consequence, he was not as readily
                    available to AIT's senior staff.</p>

                        officials?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes, all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of the American Institute at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Jim Lilley was the Director when I arrived but left shortly thereafter.
                    He was very well liked and did an excellent, discrete job. Familiar with the
                    Chinese cultural context, he enjoyed superb contacts at the highest levels and
                    performed an outstanding job on both political and commercial issues. He did
                    much to repair the frayed edges of our altered relationship and projected
                    confidence and sincerity in the strength of the unofficial relationship. After a
                    short hiatus, career Foreign Service officer Harry Thayer arrived as
                    Director.</p>
                <p>As we moved away from 1979, our relationship with the government authorities
                    stabilized. Taiwan was also changing and the nature of our political work
                    shifted. In addition to myself, there were three other officers in the General
                    Affairs Section. One of them covered what we called the tangwai, or outside the
                    party, that is, the political opposition to the ruling Kuomintang. I covered the
                    Kuomintang. Because of the break in relations, our normal contacts with the
                    Kuomintang had atrophied. AIT had good relations with the economic and the
                    commercial offices of the government and the business community, but not with
                    the ruling party. So, my job for the next two years was to reestablish the
                    relationship with the Kuomintang. When my predecessor introduced me to his
                    contacts, there were no Kuomintang officials at these 'hail and farewell'
                    receptions. Circumstances in Taipei called for a special effort. Normally one
                    arrives at post and your predecessor introduces you to the people he knew and
                    that you are going to be working with. You in turn maintain those relationships
                    and perhaps add a few new people. So, I spent the next two years working on
                    AIT's contacts with the Kuomintang. When I departed post, the third ranking
                    official in the party gave me a heart felt farewell party. Through diligence,
                    perseverance and the fruits of two years of language training, we successfully
                    reestablished a friendly and professional relationship.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, the problem for your predecessor at least
                        partly wathat that was very soon after the change of relationship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Oh, absolutely, in fact, that is quite the point. I was the first
                    officer to arrive who had no relationship with the events of 1979. In 1979, the
                    Department gave people stationed in Taipei the option of staying or departing
                    right away and two officers in the political section, Mark Pratt and Stan
                    Ifshin, decided to stay. They were extremely talented and capable officers of
                    the highest order and chose to stay and do what they could to work through the
                    changed relationship. But to the same extent, they were sort of tainted by the
                    break in 1979. I was the first person to head GAS without any connection to
                    normalization.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, it is hard to transform yourself to really in effect be a transition
                    when you are identified, symbolically at least, with the previously situation. I
                    noticed in your sheet here that you did report on democratization of Taiwan. You
                    just talked about liaison with the government party, a pretty strong party, and
                    I don't know how strong the opposition was.</p>
                <p>REUTHER: In fact, one of the key things that was happening in Taiwan at that time
                    was a consequence of the January 1979 change in diplomatic relations. The
                    political opposition saw derecognition as damaging to the ruling party's claim
                    to power. It argued that even the Americans have walked out on the KMT; that
                    Taiwan was isolated, weak, and in danger of being turned over to Beijing because
                    of KMT claims to be the government of all China. The end result of increased
                    opposition pressure and derecognition was the Kaohsiung demonstrations on Human
                    Rights Day in December 1979. The entire leadership of the opposition was in
                    Kaohsiung on that day. The government trapped the opposition into a street riot
                    and used that circumstance to crush it. One individual, because he was ill and
                    couldn't make the rally, was the only tangwai leader not rounded up. Also swept
                    up in the government crackdown and tried in military court was the leadership of
                    the Presbyterian Church of Taiwan. So from 1979 on, the worst aspects of the
                    authoritarian government that had been in place since 1949 exhibited itself.
                    Underlining the significance of these events, on the anniversary of the February
                    1947 massacre of Taiwanese protesting KMT rule, the family of one of the
                    defendants was slaughtered in its home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The trial was before you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Right. The trial was during 1980. When I arrived everyone was in jail,
                    the family was murdered, and little incidents denoting pressure on the
                    opposition happened from time to time. For example, a visiting Chinese-American
                    scholar fell off a five-story building while in police custody.</p>

                <p>REUTHER: No, that was Chen Wen-cheng.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: With the 1979 round up of the political opposition, the hard-liners
                    dominated the KMT and it entered a new period of repression. Of course, it is
                    not always clear whether acts were committed on orders or by zealous
                    lieutenants. Henry Liu was a KMT-trained political warfare officer, who worked
                    as a journalist, had fallen out of favor with the KMT, and was in the process of
                    writing a biography of Chiang Ching-kuo. The biography was supposedly very
                    critical.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, he was an American citizen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Well, at least a green card holder.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, living in Taiwan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: No, he was living in the United States. He knew he couldn't go back to
                    Taiwan. He was researching this book and some of the people that he was talking
                    to were partisan foes of the government. A group came to the United States in
                    1984 and assassinated him in his garage in a town outside of San Francisco.
                    There is an excellent book by Kaplan, Fires of the Dragon that gives a fairly
                    good description of the circumstances surrounding this murder.</p>
                <p>What is interesting about this event is that it appears to have become a turning
                    point in the way the KMT governed Taiwan. It is my impression that the younger,
                    American educated members of the Kuomintang—those who had been pushing for
                    elections and similar procedures to keep the party in power rather the
                    strong-armed tactics—were quite upset that they were a party to this murder.
                    They didn't feel it was part of their self- identification. Mainly Mainlanders,
                    they were not willing to see the Taiwanese opposition come to power, but they
                    thought different tools were available to the KMT; that it could base its
                    legitimacy on its success in economic policy. Oddly enough, there were signs of
                    the system loosening, simultaneously with these murders. The KMT lifted
                    censorship in the movies and a number of Taiwan films won awards at Asian film
                    festivals. One USIA officer, Joe Moyle, was particularly close to the film
                    industry. From time to time we would have special showings of movies that
                    handled sensitive social subjects.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>The point to make here is that Henry Liu's murder polarized opinion within the
                    KMT. Just as the conservatives used the Chungli election in 1977 to dominate the
                    moderates and went on to stage the 1979 Kaohsiung incident; the moderates gained
                    from Liu's murder. It appears to have been a decision point that moved Taiwan to
                    democracy. Ed Winkler, an academic, wrote an article in the fall of 1984 arguing
                    that politics on Taiwan were moving from hard authoritarianism to soft
                    authoritarianism. This article was published two months before Henry Liu was
                    murdered. Without the murder, Winkler's conclusions would have been premature,
                    but he may have been drawing on the stirring of these American-educated
                    officials who had little influence at the time he was writing, but whose softer
                    line would predominate in the wake of the Liu murder.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, Winkler was right but a little premature.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: A little premature. Chiang Ching-kuo is an absolutely fascinating
                    personality and an excellent biography needs to be done about him because his
                    role in the political transformation of Taiwan is not well understood. He has
                    had so many organizational responsibilities in his career that observers project
                    his organizational roles as his personal beliefs. He first came to Taiwan as a
                    strict enforcer of the security system. Later he was in charge of the China
                    Youth Corps and may have realized very early that if the KMT was going to
                    survive on Taiwan, it needed a Taiwanese patina. Nevertheless, the Mainlander
                    dominated KMT began its rule by trying to convert the Taiwanese into
                    Mainlanders. The Taiwanese language was banned in the airwaves; quota systems
                    were introduced in the school system; your registration card identified you as
                    either Mainlander or Taiwanese. Chiang, however, may have realized that the
                    army, and then the party, in time would exhaust the pool of Mainlanders. This
                    realization probably led to the Taiwanization of the upper reaches of the KMT
                    and government, which all Taiwan watchers, and we in our turn, observed and
                    reported. When a cabinet shuffle would occur, when the Kuomintang would have a
                    standing committee election, Chiang would add one or more Taiwanese, generally
                    balanced by Mainlander appointments, but slowly resulting in increasing numbers
                    of Taiwanese in positions of influence. After each of these events, GAS
                    submitted a cable explaining the significance of creeping Taiwanization. We
                    would add that our interlocutors characterized the Taiwanese appointees as
                    younger, Western educated, and more talented. Young, American educated
                    Mainlanders suggested they and their Taiwanese counterparts were the group
                    Chiang increasingly relied upon. In any event, we saw the process of
                    Taiwanization of the KMT was preliminary to the democratization of Taiwan.</p>
                <p>Our reporting from Taiwan focused on a couple of subjects. We watched the
                    Taiwanization of the party. We watched the impact of the western educated
                    technocrats in the economic arena. We also reported on the tangwai, the
                    political opposition, most of which was still in jail serving their Kaohsiung
                    incident sentences. Their wives, however, took up the challenge and rode their
                    husbands' martyrdom to subsequent electoral victories. We extensively spoke to,
                    and reported on, the activities of these opposition leaders.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>The Taiwan opposition could be divided between those in exile in Japan and the
                    United States and the tangwai on the island. Despite the government line that
                    the political opposition (meaning the exiles) was a hair's breath from sedition
                    and terrorism, on the island, the two sides played a sophisticated fencing match
                    that defined the boundary for tangwai activity. This was particularly evident in
                    the media field. The opposition was not allowed to own a newspaper, but it could
                    publish magazines. From time to time, the Garrison Command, the premier security
                    agency at the time, closed down the magazines. So, members of the opposition
                    would register a number of magazine names. When the Garrison Command closed one
                    title, for some article mentioning Chiang Ching-kuo's secret fortune or half
                    brother Chiang Wei-kuo's activities, the opposition would return the next month
                    under a new name. This ballet was interesting to watch. Sometimes Garrison
                    Command would let the tangwai distribute an issue and then ban the magazine
                    (collecting copies for sale, but in fact allowing some distribution); sometimes
                    they closed it down at the printing shop. This was a great cat and mouse game in
                    which each side tested the other. In an entrepreneurial spirit, sometimes the
                    opposition would start a rumor that the next issue was going to be banned in
                    order to boost sales.</p>
                <p>AIT, and the embassy before it, had long reported on political events on Taiwan.
                    What we were watching was new because the jailing of the opposition leader
                    unified the movement (to the extent squabbling leaders were in jail) and handled
                    it an excellent issue to proselytize the population. I should also note that the
                    U.S. Congress was paying more attention to internal dynamics on Taiwan during
                    the 1980s. Congressmen Solarz from New York visited Taiwan and publicly identify
                    himself with the opposition. His attention assisted their cause and gave them
                    some cover. I recall accompanying him to a speaking engagement at a Taipei
                    hotel. His address was not as remarkable as the opportunity for the opposition
                    to meet without being arrested. It was interesting to note that the tangwai
                    provided its own strict security on this occasion. For those who look at the
                    democratization of Taiwan for clues to the possible democratization of Mainland
                    China, note that the consequences of trade (not only in generating wealth, but
                    training entrepreneurial skills) and American education are far more important
                    than human rights posturing by foreigners.</p>
                <p>Q: It was a very interesting period both in terms of U.S. relations, if you will,
                    with Taiwan and in the light of normalization with the Peoples Republic in 1979,
                    but also in terms of what was happening in Taiwan, itself. Of course you were on
                    the political side, but we haven't talked about the economic side but the
                    economy was booming, trade was prospering.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Trade was booming, substantial numbers of American businesses were in
                    Taiwan, encouraged in the early years by U.S. aid programs, American investment
                    and trade opportunities. Although my immediate responsibilities were political,
                    I made an effort to go to the American Chamber of Commerce breakfasts and
                    meetings to gather a sense from them about what was going on economically and
                    politically. The Chamber was very active and a number of individual American
                    businessmen had been in Taiwan for years. I particularly remember a couple of
                    business issues. Most businesses were tied to their American home offices by
                    increasingly sophisticated telecommunications. Garrison Command regulated
                    communications and had set a maximum baud transmission speed so that it could
                    easily intercept and read any traffic. By the early 1980s, however, contemporary
                    equipment had long exceeded Taiwan's allowable transmission speed. Home offices
                    were complaining to their managers on Taiwan. While the companies improved
                    company-wide speeds, their circuits to Taiwan were comparatively slower and, in
                    some cases, required separate circuits. The issue for the resident business
                    people was do they just upgrade their equipment and not inform the local
                    authorities or seek permission? The justification for 'do and don't tell' was in
                    appreciation of the Chinese cultural context: not directly asking saved face.
                    Asking guaranteed a negative response. I forgot how it turned out.</p>
                <p>I was impressed with the economic progress evident on Taiwan. Of course, the
                    island's entrepreneurial spirit had its positive and negative consequences.
                    American Chamber of Commerce (AmCham) members from time to time would express
                    concern about losing good mid-level managers. Because of the open economy, lax
                    intellectual property rights regulations and 'can-do' attitude among the
                    Taiwanese, American companies often faced a situation where a trusted local
                    middle manager would learn some part of the company's manufacturing process and
                    then set himself up in business making a clone of that item, often at a cheaper
                    price.</p>
                <p>Another entrepreneurial story. During language training we traveled around the
                    island and practiced conducting interviews. Once, we stopped at a substantial
                    shoe manufacturing facility, I think in Taichung. The Taiwanese owner was making
                    good money, but he knew nothing about design or fashion issues. During our
                    interview, it became clear he had an arrangement with a Japanese trading firm
                    from which he received patterns, dies and tools. He manufactured shoes to order
                    for the Japanese trading company that sold to the American market. I have seen
                    little academic writing about the role of Japan in post-war economic
                    developments on Taiwan.</p>

                <p>REUTHER: There were a number of things happening in Taiwan. I think somebody
                    ought to research, for example, Taiwan films at this time. During the 1980s the
                    Kuomintang allowed the Taiwan film industry to move away from a very sterile
                    period to producing innovative and interesting pieces. I recall the Taiwan
                    directors even started to win awards at Hong Kong film festivals. The appearance
                    of creative films was the result, in part, of a process where the senior KMT
                    leadership was looking for opportunities to give the new American-trained party
                    members experience. The KMT was a bureaucracy; members worked their way up and
                    proved their loyalty and competence along the way. At the time I was there, it
                    seemed that the leadership started some of the American educated people in the
                    cultural directorate. What these new people did was to loosen restrictions on
                    the movie people and allowed them to be creative.</p>
                <p>On the sociological side, Taiwan was the richest Chinese society in human
                    history. But Chinese cultural history and embedded social signals assumed a
                    traditional marginal economic (primarily agricultural) existence. Some in the
                    KMT were concerned that, to the extent that traditional culture might lead
                    people to dissipate their wealth, the KMT began a newspaper based “Ann Landers”
                    column to inculcate new social signals. The message in part was puritanical,
                    invest wisely and stay out of the bars. I often met young Taiwanese businessmen
                    who owned two or three substantial businesses and were now channeling their
                    wealth into mistresses or dance halls. Was this culture or a lack of alternative
                    investment opportunities?</p>
                <p>Apparently, as political and social changes accumulated, the ground was shifting
                    under the KMT. I remember being told in all seriousness by a ranking Kuomintang
                    official, that the Americans underestimated KMT factionalism. He argued that one
                    of the reasons for going slowly on democratization was otherwise the KMT would
                    shatter into small parties and lose the reins of power. He was certain rapid
                    democratization would lead to chaos. Perhaps, while there were limits on our
                    ability to see KMT factionalism, we understood the tensions between the
                    moderates and the hard liners during the mid-1980s, primary over elections.</p>
                <p>The KMT, which needed a mechanism to legitimize itself and extend to the grass
                    roots, had held elections on Taiwan since the early 1950s. These elections
                    allowed them to fan rivalries among local Taiwanese factions. The KMT would
                    support one local faction one election and another local faction the next
                    election. But, the older hard liners had always believed that the KMT should
                    always win an election by a landslide. The people returning to the island, the
                    moderates, the modernizers, were saying, you could win an election with 51
                    percent of the vote, your manhood was intact and you were still in power. That
                    was a revolutionary idea and it took years before the older members of the party
                    agreed that the only thing you had to do was to win the election, not overwhelm
                    it. In fact, one of the senior reformers at one time, Lee Huan, lost his job
                    because during an election in the late 1970s because riots broke out over
                    allegations of KMT ballot stuffing, the old timers didn't think 80 percent was
                    good enough.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>Q: In this period from 1983-85, to what extent was there interaction between
                    Taiwan and the mainland and was there investment beginning to take place by
                    Taiwanese entrepreneurs in China or did that all come later?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: In the early 1980s there was no investment and little interaction.
                    Getting permission to leave the island was very difficult. The Taiwan Garrison
                    Command watched Mainlander and Taiwanese alike. In those days it was recognized
                    that it was the Mainlanders, brought to Taiwan in the last days of 1949, who
                    longed to visit the Mainland. One tangwai stalwart at the time told me that
                    Taiwanese were always worrying about a sell-out; that, as the Mainlanders aged,
                    they might turn to Beijing in their twilight years and turn Taiwan over. After
                    all, the KMT and the CCP were of a single mind that Taiwan was just a Chinese
                    province.</p>
                <p>For the Mainlanders, despite Garrison Command, there was a safety value. One
                    could go to Hong Kong and once in Hong Kong one could disappear and visit
                    mainland relatives. There were rumors that, because the people in Fujian
                    Province spoke the same language as people in Taiwan, Taiwanese business people
                    could sneak back to Fujian and do a little business. This seemed inordinately
                    risky for a Taiwanese to me. The security forces easily monitored such travel.
                    But, the KMT couldn't cut it off because that would damage its Mainlander
                    supporters. So, they thought since they couldn't cut it off, they let the
                    security organs monitor and regulate it. As the Mainlanders aged, contact with
                    mainland China opened a little bit more each year. For example, our language
                    teachers in 1982 were able to call their Shanghai relatives via a telephone link
                    through Hong Kong that switched the call into the mainland system. I remember
                    one of our teachers in tears; they had called for the first time that night. It
                    was the first conversation they had had with their relatives since 1949.</p>
                <p>While easily monitored and easily controlled, everyone seemed to believe that
                    some contact was going on. The Taiwanese opposition with whom we were in contact
                    believed it, but saw contact as propitiating the Mainlander community and spoke
                    of this contact as evidence of a possible KMT sell-out. When the domestic
                    reforms of 1988-89 came along, the abolition of martial law removed the
                    authority of the Garrison Command to monitor this contact. The sub rosa contacts
                    increased to the point where it was publicly acknowledged and regulated. Looking
                    into the future, it isn't until you get into the 1990- 91 period and the
                    establishment of the Mainland Affairs Council and States Exchange Foundation
                    that cross-straits contacts include Taiwanese business people in any
                    numbers.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>Anyway, every now and then there would be a whispered conversation about a
                    Mainlander who had gone to the mainland. The basic rule was you could go to the
                    mainland and see your relatives, if you don't talk about it, which makes a lot a
                    sense in the Chinese context. Saving face means not trumpeting your activities.
                    For example, at normalization we told the Chinese we would sell military
                    equipment to Taiwan and they said, “Well, please don't do that.” We said that
                    the subject was not negotiable; we were committed to not abandoning Taiwan. They
                    said, “Okay, but don't embarrass us by doing it publicly.” At that time and I
                    think it still is, on all arms sales of $50 million or more you have to notify
                    Congress, a requirement which guaranteed publicity. So, the Carter
                    Administration chopped up all the arms sales to Taiwan into $49 million
                    packages. They would manipulate package size to keep it below this threshold.
                    Taipei knew it, Beijing knew it, but as long as we didn't talk about it, we
                    could continue an arm sales relationship.</p>
                <p>Q: During this period when you were in Taiwan from 1981-85, first as a language
                    student and then the political section chief, I assume you did not travel to the
                    mainland at all?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: No Mainland travel, that's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that against policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Well, in my case, I had a full plate on Taiwan and the reporting from
                    the embassy and four consulates in China satisfied any lingering curiosity.
                    Those assigned to AIT were discouraged from Mainland travel. They would have had
                    to travel on non- diplomatic passports. Complications could have arisen in those
                    early days after normalization that could have complicated our claims of
                    unofficiality. Of course, diplomatic passport carrying language students might
                    proceed to their next assignment on the mainland—which they would do via home
                    leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not from Taiwan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Right. In the first place there were no direct transportation
                    arrangements. And we wanted to maintain the veil of unofficiality. So Foreign
                    Service travelers would go from Taiwan to their home leave address and then on
                    to their assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a matter of changing status too, because an officer
                        at AInominally left government employment.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Correct, like military officers, Foreign Service officers are appointed
                    under a presidential commission. This bit of personnel arcania was one of the
                    reasons behind the original draft of the Taiwan Relations Act. We needed an
                    administrative device which allowed Foreign Service officers to resign their
                    commissions, take a job with this private company, AIT, and still be eligible
                    for reinstatement as a commissioned officer without the loss of benefits. Let me
                    tell you, it took a lot of legal thinking to turn that light on and in the end
                    we were never able to apply that system to our own military. AIT Taipei had a
                    military section, but there is no way in our legislation, or via the regulations
                    the uniformed serviced followed, for a military officer to resign his commission
                    and then return to duty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they were all retired military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: They were all retired military who had had full military careers,
                    retired, and then were picked up as private hires. It was not possible for them
                    to go back at all.</p>
                <p>Q: I remember working in Personnel a little later than this and trying to keep
                    track of all these people and arrangements. I think there were times when we
                    weren't perfect and temporarily lost an individual here and there.</p>
                <p>REUTHER: It was one of the more unique circumstances, I think, thaForeign Service
                    Personnel has gotten itself into.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, it still continues.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes. It still continues and works well. It is a system that satisfies
                    our need to generate language officers and staff AIT Taipei. There is some
                    debate about moving the language school onto the mainland, but that involves
                    many financial issues and with the present budgetary situation I don't think
                    that it can be done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It also involves some other issues in the Peoples Republic
                        iterms of hiring teachers and allowing students to be free and travel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: I don't think the PRC has a problem with that because we were running
                    language lessons when I was there and traveling freely. But there is a
                    difference between a few language classes and a complete, FSI-administered,
                    language school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not now, but I think in the past they have had

                <p>Is there anything else you would like to discuss about your time in Taiwan? If
                    not, maybe we should go on to your next assignment, which was Chief of the
                    Regional Anti-Piracy Unit, Refugee Section, American embassy, Bangkok. That got
                    you back to Thailand, but that is an unusual Foreign Service assignment to be
                    involved with pirates.</p>
                <p>REUTHER: More than unusual. Many Foreign Service assignments stress reporting or
                    negotiating skills, rarely do people have program management opportunities. In
                    this case there was a massive outpouring of Vietnamese starting in 1978-79.
                    Actually most of those people were Chinese, although perhaps second generation.
                    In any event, in the eyes of the Vietnamese government, these refugees were
                    Chinese and Hanoi wanted to get rid of its Chinese population. As a consequence,
                    large numbers of people fled into the Gulf of Siam, only to be plundered by the
                    Cambodian/Thai/Malaysian fishermen in the area. Like the refugees at the time of
                    the fall of Saigon in 1975, some in this refugee population had connections to
                    the United States. In any event, the death rate, rape, robbery of the refugees
                    was unacceptable. The U.S. felt a responsibility to act. AID invited Fred Cluny,
                    who was later killed in Chechnya (former USSR territory), to design a program to
                    halt these deprecations. He was a brilliant man and really understood
                    humanitarian relief programs. Congressman Solarz, whom I knew from Taiwan,
                    organized congressional funding for the program.</p>
                <p>Cluny's idea was to work on a regional basis with the Thai, Malaysian,
                    Singaporean and Indonesian governments to centralize crime reporting. One of the
                    legal problems was that each country's judicial system was handicapped if the
                    victim ultimately landed in another country. If we were to identify and bring
                    perpetrators to justice, we needed the cooperation of the countries surrounding
                    the Gulf of Siam. My job was to use the prestige and resources of the USG to
                    facilitate that interregional cooperation among the respective governments. I
                    contacted Thai, Malaysian, and Singaporean foreign and interior ministry
                    officials in pursuit of our objectives.</p>
                <p>The core of the program was an attempt to professionalize and strengthen Thai
                    police forces to handle this criminal outbreak. My liaison with Thai interior
                    ministry officials, many of whom I knew from ten years previously, was as the
                    blocker for the quarterback. The key member of the team was a DEA agent who
                    first came to Thailand as a Peace Corps volunteer. An absolutely brilliant man,
                    Tex Learly had both the language skills and the law enforcement professionalism
                    to gain the active cooperation of the Thai police.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a narcotics element to this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Not necessarily, except that Tex was the absolute perfect person for
                    this assignment. He originally came to Thailand as a Peace Corps volunteer,
                    acquired excellent Thai, and enjoyed the country. He later went into police work
                    and DEA. I think while with DEA he had an assignment to Thailand, which he also
                    found attractive. So, when they were looking around for someone who understood
                    police work, had excellent Thai (he could even speak the royal vocabulary), and
                    would understand the needs of the police, his name surfaced. By the time I
                    arrived, Tex was already there. We also had a contractor, Steve Kraus, a young
                    man from Minnesota with extensive understanding of refugee issues and programs,
                    who completed the team. His enthusiasm, knowledge of Thailand, and familiarity
                    with refugee issues was a great addition to the program. My job was liaison with
                    the Thai civil authorities to see that the Thai Ministry of Interior supported
                    this program.</p>
                <p>Now you have to understand a little bit of Thai history. Remember we earlier
                    discussed the student demonstrations that sparked the October 1973 coup? One of
                    the consequences of that public uprising was, even though it was the army
                    shooting down the students, the public burned down every police station in
                    Bangkok. Public enmity for the police has a history. The police had lost the
                    coup of 1956. The penalty they paid was that military officers were assigned as
                    heads of the police from that time. The military officers had no interest in
                    suppressing corruption and building a positive public image of the police. So,
                    by 1973 the police had a reputation for venality and corruption. When the public
                    had the opportunity, it burned down the police stations. In protecting the boat
                    people by supporting the police, one is running against the grain of benign
                    neglect into which the police had fallen. So, my job was to liaison with the
                    Ministry of Interior as a symbol of our interest in encouraging a
                    professionalization of the police. There were two police forces actually, the
                    Border Patrol Police and the regular national constabulary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And in this program we were working with both?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes. One of the advantages that I brought to the program was that,
                    because of my previous time in Thailand working the northeast and visiting every
                    district chief and every governor, etc., all those officials I had known ten
                    years earlier had moved up in the Thai system. They were now at the assistant
                    secretary level in the Ministry of Interior. So I could walk in and have
                    immediate rapport with a ranking government official. Of course, the program
                    would have to survive on its own merits but at least one got in the door. In
                    fact I have always thought that one of the things that the Foreign Service
                    should aspire to in these major countries is a situation where people come in as
                    young officers, go on to other assignments, come back as middle level officers,
                    and finally return as senior embassy officers. That way you have your friends
                    moving up with you or you move up with them and you have instant rapport. It
                    certainly made a difference in this case.</p>
                <p>So, what we were trying to do was to provide training, encouragement, and
                    political cover to our interest in protecting Vietnamese boat people.</p>

                <p>***</p>
                <p>Q: Today is October 10. Dave, you have been talking about your responsibilities
                    as Chief of the Anti-piracy Unit in Bangkok from 1985-87. We have talked about
                    the boat people and the pirate threat to them that you dealt with. What were
                    some of the other things that your responsibilities evolved into during your
                    time in Bangkok?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: The anti-piracy program was enormously successful and drew the attention
                    of Ambassador Bill Brown. He and Lacey Wright, who was the counselor of embassy
                    for Refugee Affairs at that time, decided that the embassy needed to have a
                    better handle on what we called refugee protection issues. Over the years since
                    the end of the Vietnam War a large number of refugees flowed into Thailand.
                    Extensive camps were established as the international community dealt first with
                    humanitarian subsistence issues and then resettlement questions. In the
                    meantime, any number of things happened from time to time in these camps—general
                    security issues, for example. There were camps on the Cambodian border where
                    rival political groups would clash. While the UNHCR was responsibile for
                    organizing services to all the camps in Thailand, the ambassador felt that the
                    embassy should take a more active role and independently evaluate the situation.
                    So, we took our little group and expanded it from anti-piracy, a very specific
                    issue, to being the office in charge of refugee protection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you work with not only Thai authorities but I suppose
                        with UNHCR and some of the other agencies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Exactly, there was a tremendous expansion in our contact work and all
                    the agencies we dealt with, both UN agencies and NGOs, that is, the volunteers
                    in the camp who provided the sanitation facilities, the training, the health
                    care, etc. The facilities being provided at each camp varied with how long the
                    camps had been in Thailand. For example, the Vietnamese camps along the
                    Cambodian border were fairly sophisticated by this time. The NGOs in these camps
                    had been there for years and were very familiar with their work. But, still it
                    was a difficult time. We woke up one morning to hear that one of the camps had
                    been mortared. We dashed down there, about a two and a half-hour drive to the
                    Cambodian border, to check it out. We were there to play detective: who did
                    this? What does it represent? Who do we need to pressure to do a better job?
                    What we found out was the incident involved RPG (Rocket Propelled Grenade)
                    rounds rather than mortar rounds. My contribution was to dig up pieces of
                    shrapnel to bring to our military colleagues so they can identify the weaponry
                    and start identifying whom might be responsible.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>On the other hand, there were camps in the northern part of Thailand, in the
                    Chiang Mai area, which represented Laotian groups that were coming over as the
                    Communists were taking power or as the insurgencies of which they were a part
                    began to fall apart. Most of these people were Hmong tribesmen. The Thai were
                    quite eager that each camp represented a separate ethnic group. It was easier
                    for them to manage. The Thai Government, of course, also was concerned about its
                    security. Harboring refugees could seem like a political challenge to Thailand's
                    neighbors. The Thai authorities were torn between their international
                    responsibility to care for and resettle the refugees, i.e., making being a
                    refugee attractive, and their self-interest in closing the border. There was a
                    constant struggle between us and the NGOs and the Thai on that very issue. As I
                    was joking with somebody recently, one of the disasters we had in the
                    anti-piracy program was that a Vietnamese refugee once won a million dollars in
                    the California lottery. This was instantaneously broadcast to Vietnam and for
                    four weeks we had this spike in exits. It just drove the Thai crazy because they
                    are very anti-Vietnamese, they didn't want any more Vietnamese, they didn't want
                    anything done that would encourage Vietnamese. They were willing to be a
                    way-station for those people who legitimately could go on to other countries,
                    but they did not see themselves as a settlement place of last resort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall the order of magnitude figures on the
                        refugees iThailand at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: We are talking about 100,000 people in ten camps or so. One of the
                    things we tried to do to stem the flow and show the Thai that we were on their
                    side was to start up the ODP, the orderly departure program. This was a program
                    where we would put people in Saigon to interview Vietnamese who identified
                    themselves as possibly having relatives in the United States. This way people
                    did not have to make the hazardous journey or at least already knew they did not
                    have a good resettlement case.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These would be American consular officers who would do
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: That is right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They would fly over?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>REUTHER: They would fly into Saigon where there was a small office. But, the
                    Vietnamese were not eager to admit that their people were leaving so we were
                    torn by our promises to the Thai to cut down on the number of people coming in
                    and using the ODP program to do that, and the Vietnamese desire not to admit
                    that anybody wanted to leave. So the Vietnamese would try to close down our
                    program or hobble it or not cooperate and the Thai were always watching the
                    numbers saying we were not moving enough cases, and hence continuing to
                    encourage the land and sea exodus. This became a very important issue between
                    the two countries and was one of the issues that the ambassador spent a good
                    deal of his time on, briefing the Thai Government on our efforts.</p>
                <p>Q: Besides the sensitivities involving the Thai people and government and the
                    Vietnamese government, there were also domestic political sensitivities in the
                    United States. Were their congressional visitors? Did you get involved in that
                    debate of how many refugees we should accept and what our responsibilities
                    were?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: Those kinds of issues were generally fought out in Washington. But we
                    would often get congressional delegations that wanted to go visit the camps. I
                    recall one particular time Congresswoman Schroeder was in country and wanted to
                    visit the camps. While we all know there is domestic criticism of domestic
                    congressional people traveling, the schedule Congresswoman Schroeder set for us
                    was pretty demanding. And she was inquisitive. I remember sitting in this one
                    small house before we reached the main camp and my Thai assistant is translating
                    from Cambodian to Thai and I translated the Thai for the Congresswoman. It was a
                    little bit slow, but everyone enjoyed it. Of course travel conditions to the
                    camps were basic, Toyota Land Cruisers over dirty, dust blown roads. But there
                    were people like Congressman Solarz and Congresswoman Pat Schroeder who made
                    those trips.</p>
                <p>Q: That was certainly a very important part of the end of the Southeast Asia
                    wars, the handling of the refugees. There was obviously a very important human
                    dimension, but also an international geopolitical one.</p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes, and the Thai were very focused. The Thai National Security Council
                    and its leader Colonel Prasong gave a high priority to the refugee issue in
                    Thai-American relations. Colonel Prasong became NSC director when the refugees
                    first arrived. He was still there in 1987 when I left because he made it a
                    personal pledge that he wouldn't move from that job because he was the person
                    who received the assurances from the United States that Thailand would not be
                    left holding the refugee bag. So, rather than move on to other jobs, he stayed
                    there as the institutional memory of that pledge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are in 1996 now, do you know what the general situation

                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>REUTHER: There still are camps but I must say I haven't dealt witthe issue in
                    recent years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else about your third time in Thailand that we
                        shoulcover?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: A couple of little anecdotes about what it means to be a professional
                    officer and how you handle friends in a changing circumstance. With the end of
                    the Vietnam War, the intimate relationship that we had with the Thai had to
                    shift to a new footing. We discussed earlier that a political appointee
                    ambassador in the 1970s was unable to make the transition to a more equal
                    relationship. Ambassador Brown, however, was quite adept at using all his
                    talents to get himself well and favorably known with a government that had seen
                    all kinds of American ambassadors over the years. I remember when he first
                    arrived in country, one of the things he did was go to Saraburi where the Thai
                    have their Army parachute school and jumped out of a plane with a local group.
                    Now, he is an former Marine and knows his business, but it was an important
                    little adjustment which then took care of that whole segment of the Thai
                    politic, the military. From then on, he gained their respect and received
                    priority consideration for American interests.</p>
                <p>The ambassador took very seriously his responsibility to inform Americans about
                    events in Thailand and the issues the embassy faced. He was always available to
                    brief groups, whether tourist, business or academic. He encouraged his other
                    officers to make themselves available if he couldn't. Once we had a
                    congressional delegation coming through Bangkok that very explicitly had said it
                    was on a shopping tour and didn't want to be bothered. The ambassador just was
                    not going to let an opportunity to brief pass by. We met the delegation out at
                    the airport with one of these tourist vans, a nice well- appointed bus with a PA
                    system. The ambassador stood on the steps of the van as it was coming into
                    Bangkok. It take between 35-40 minutes to drive from the airport to downtown
                    Bangkok and he took that time to welcome the congressional delegation, offer his
                    embassy staff for anything they needed and then proceeded to give them a
                    briefing on the Thai economic and political situation.</p>
                <p>Q: I can remember doing the latter, briefing a congressional group from the
                    middle of a bus, but I never felt that my calling to serve my country required
                    me to parachute out of an airplane, so I think Ambassador Brown was a special
                    kind of person to be able to do that.</p>
                <p>After you finished your time in Bangkok in 1987, I believe you went to Beijing.
                    Was that the first time you had visited the Peoples Republic of China?</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Actually no. I had that one visit in 1980 when I escorted the S&amp;T
                    delegation to Beijing. But that made going to Beijing on tour in 1987 all the
                    more remarkable because China over those decades of the 70s and 80s is going to
                    be one of those places where people will have such stark comparisons. You will
                    run into people who would say: “Well, you should have been here then,” or, “ the
                    difference is so demonstrative.” I think it is an amazing part of the way China
                    has changed that what we saw in Beijing seven years earlier was quite different
                    from what I saw when I arrived in 1987.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you only in Beijing during your earlier visit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes, and there was hardly a vehicle on the road, people were very drably
                    dressed, and that alone just driving in from the airport you saw a lot more
                    vehicles and people much more interestingly and colorfully dressed. Obviously
                    they had more income and things to spend it on.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: The ambassador was Winston Lord and his deputy was Peter Thomson. The
                    economic counselor was Kent Wiedemann and I was his deputy and concurrently head
                    of the external reporting unit in the economic section. So, the economic section
                    was divided in half, if you will. One half looked at what the internal economy
                    was doing and the other half basically ran our trade relations with China, thus,
                    we focused on China's external economic relations.</p>

                <p>REUTHER: The Most Favored Nation status at that time was as it was when we first
                    started in 1972, that is, sort of an annual update. This is a draw back from the
                    Jackson- Vanick Act which was designed to punish the Soviets over Jewish
                    emigration. The Jackson-Vanick Bill only illustrates, I think, why lawyers and
                    diplomats are worried about precedent, because if you do something in one area
                    you may get stuck with it in another area. For example, Jackson-Vanick more
                    broadly said that to gain MFN a country had to promise to allow free emigration.
                    Well, when we explained Jackson- Vanick to Deng Xiaoping he said, “How many do
                    you want?”</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Right. Actually he said, “You want 20 million, 30 million? We can do
                    that.” And he did it with such a straight face that the Americans really did not
                    know how to respond. Was he pulling their legs, lining people up, threatening,
                    or what? The whole Jackson-Vanick thing is totally inexplicable to China. But,
                    here we are stuck with a policy of making China promise free emigration—which is
                    precisely what we do not want. In fact after getting this promise from him we
                    had to go around and say don't you dare do such a thing. This sort of
                    illustrates that when you are dealing with China on its own, all the stereotypes
                    from the Cold War, all the anti-Russian stuff, all the anti-Chinese Communist
                    stuff really gets in your way.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you still there when Tiananmen Square took
                        place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Oh, yes. That was in 1989. Before we get into that let me address the
                    issue of continuing negotiations. My office was responsible for economic
                    agreements between the United States and China and many of the things that I had
                    worked on while on the desk from 1979-81 period were still important issues. So,
                    we worked on civil aviation a great deal. Not only negotiating further
                    expansion, because the original agreement I think only allowed one U.S. airline
                    initially could serve Beijing and a second airline could come in and serve
                    Shanghai. We had more airlines wanting to get into the China market and were
                    deregulated. So, we have to renegotiate with them that whole bit plus cargo
                    sharing and things like that. So, yes, during that time I had a little rut in
                    the road from our office to CAAC where we did a lot of negotiating.</p>
                <p>Q: Were there also trade negotiations, delegations from the Special Trade
                    Representative's Office that came? STR did not have a person in the embassy did
                    they?</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>REUTHER: No, because USTR had a worldwide mandate, they did not have a person in
                    the embassy. But, as issues arose, USTR would lead negotiating delegations to
                    Beijing. I can remember one such circumstance involving tungsten. Chinese
                    tungsten was being sold in Europe in violation of a marketing agreement we had
                    with Beijing. Tungsten, like many minerals, is very specific to origins and
                    trace minerals identified it as of Chinese origin. So, with that evidence in
                    hand, we went to the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Relations
                    (MOFERT) and say, “Look, China is dumping tungsten in Europe against the
                    marketing agreement we have. We will impose penalties, if you don't stop this.”
                    They said, “Don't look at us, we are not selling it.” What really was happening
                    was that Beijing was decentralizing the economy—as Western economics had been
                    encouraging them—which meant that the province of Yunnan, which controlled these
                    mines, had the freedom to market tungsten and were doing so in violation of
                    Beijing's international agreements. USTR arrived and we had about a week of
                    negotiations on tungsten that resulted in them having to recentralize their
                    economy to the extent that Beijing was required to impose an export licensing
                    system on the provinces. I presumed Yunnan was not happy with this reassertion
                    of central authority and probably bargained for a trade-off in another policy
                    area. This whole incident was typical of new problems that arose from China's
                    participation in international trade. By the mid-1980s economic reform meant
                    that there were more actors on the Chinese side, many of whom had short-term,
                    parochial, interests that would lead to trade disputes with other countries
                    until the central government developed new administrative mechanisms.</p>
                <p>So, that was one type of negotiation. Another one, and one that would continue
                    for years as it had in Taiwan, was intellectual property rights. We began to
                    address IPR issues in the mid-1980s. As is typical of Foreign Service work, we
                    in the embassy looked around and said, “Okay, we are about to talk to the
                    Chinese about intellectual property rights. What do you suppose their position
                    is going to be?” We took the initiative to plumb the various ministries,
                    determine which ones might be on a Chinese IPR delegation, and gain an
                    understanding of each ministry's approach to IPR issues. It was easy for us to
                    contact the ministries because the Chinese side saw the Economic Section as
                    commercial officers. So I, or my colleagues in the economic section, had the
                    widest range of contacts around Beijing. We interviewed people at the party
                    schools. We talked to people on the factory floor. We had complete access to the
                    ministries. The whole town was ours. In fact, we had better contacts around
                    Beijing than the Political Section, and often had better insights into the
                    Chinese government and policy debates.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in advance to the negotiation team coming?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes, in advance of the negotiation. This is what the Foreign Service
                    does to prep for these things. What we found out was that the National Science
                    Foundation and the educational establishment in China opposed IPR. They opposed
                    it on the basis that since China had no patent or copyright legislation of its
                    own, and it was un-Marxian to be paid for the results of your own intellectual
                    endeavors, they saw no benefit in it. We also found out that the R&amp;D
                    sections of industrial enterprises practiced what might be called reverse
                    engineering. It seems counterintuitive, but the Chinese intellectual
                    establishment was not pro-IPR in the mid-1980s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Reverse engineering? Figure out how something works and is
                        putogether.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Exactly. When you get your Time-Life book on how to do your deck in the
                    back, that is what they were doing. On the other hand, when we talked to MOFERT
                    officials they were very eager to obtain some agreement on intellectual property
                    rights because foreign investors had come to them and said, “I am not going to
                    bring my plant here until you can protect my industrial process.” So, we
                    reported our findings on the Chinese views on IPR to Washington. This research
                    was in preparation for making the U.S. delegations' presentation as sharp as
                    possible.</p>
                <p>A fairly sizable American delegation arrived and we had a fascinating week or so
                    with the Chinese. This preliminary effort was pretty much an educational one. We
                    tried to explain how we looked at patents and copyrights and why we deemed it
                    important; why it was important to our trade; how much of our trade involved IPR
                    issues. We argued how unfortunate it would be for them if they were unable to
                    take advantage of the IPR gateway to technology by paying a few royalties. We
                    pointed out that the industrial world would not be favorably disposed, if China
                    continued to violate these patents. For the Chinese ministries that had
                    intellectual rights offices, and not all of them did, we learned that there was
                    another major input into Chinese thinking on IPR negotiations. These offices
                    were very much aware of the status of our negotiation with the Japanese and
                    Taiwanese on some of the same issues. During my ministry interviews, one of the
                    very sharp comments I received, and reported, was from a senior cabinet
                    secretary who supervised economic ministries, who said, “You cannot expect China
                    to get ahead of what you have gotten out of the other governments.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We will not give more.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Exactly, they would not give more. So, what we had obtained from Taiwan
                    or Japan was a cap for them in negotiating with us. Made sense to me that they
                    would not want to be seen as giving more, or acting weaker, than Taipei or
                    Tokyo.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>Q: When you were on the China Desk and here again in Beijing, you were involved
                    in negotiations with the Chinese. Are they tough negotiators?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: While I wasn't in a position to be the negotiator for the American side,
                    in Washington and Beijing I did participate in some typical, primarily economic,
                    negotiations. I stress economic because economic negotiations do not tend to be
                    zero- sum enterprises, but areas where both sides could readily see mutual
                    advantages. Of course, any negotiation session involves a great deal of
                    educating the other side as to why you are taking the position you are. Remember
                    our civil aviation negotiations in Washington? How surprised the Chinese were to
                    find that we did not have a national airline?</p>
                <p>I am not impressed with the idea that the Chinese are extraordinary negotiators -
                    that the Americans can manly toss vodka with the Russians, but collapse when the
                    Chinese pull out the egg rolls. Often the issue is not Chinese negotiating
                    expertise, but pressure on our side that may damage our own position. When I was
                    on the China Desk, all Cabinet level officials wanted to travel to China. Each
                    trip had to look successful. Something had to be done or signed. I think the
                    Vice President wanted to travel to China and the main trip even would be the
                    opening of the consulate in Guangzhou. Except we had not finished negotiating
                    the space and facilities for a proper consulate. Now, the Vice President's
                    office doesn't care what the needs of the State Department were. State is to
                    serve and suck it up. So we ended up with a consulate in the Dong Fang Hotel, a
                    miserable facilitiy from a work and security angle. Was this the product of
                    superior Chinese negotiating? Not really.</p>
                <p>Remember that in negotiating the Maritime agreement, the Chinese were strongly
                    committed to a reciprocal list of ports? Fact. This illustrates why being in the
                    Foreign Service was so interesting. You were there to tell your side what the
                    trends, fads, and goals of the other side were so that you could factor that
                    into your negotiations. Maybe that would help uncover the Chinese bottom line,
                    maybe that would uncover some important deadline.</p>
                <p>The reality is that there are differences in national negotiating behaviors, but
                    they are not often as stark as the op-ed pages suggest. I always enjoyed
                    negotiating with the Thai. Thailand had never been colonized, a fact which made
                    the Thai proud and able negotiators. In contrast, I was told, the Vietnamese
                    were always worried that you had something up your sleeve and that the subject
                    of this round of negotiating was only a pretext. I suspect the Chinese are
                    somewhere in between.</p>

                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>REUTHER: In Beijing we were just starting out. Across the straits, we had been
                    seeking IPR agreement from the government on Taiwan for years. When I was in
                    Taiwan, 1983- 85, the Taiwan authorities finally agreed to some basic IPR
                    protection, after almost 15 years of discussion, for American authored books.
                    For years American manuscripts were pirated in Taiwan. The Taiwan publisher
                    would mark the front page “for sale in Taiwan only” or something like that, but
                    then sell throughout Asia. Everybody went through Taiwan to buy their copies of
                    the American classics, academic volumes book of the month volumes - the range of
                    pirated books was significant. Even esoteric tomes such as Ambassador Hummel's
                    father's book, “Biography of the Ch'ing Dynasty,” a three volume work, was
                    pirated.</p>
                <p>So, Beijing was very much aware of our success in the region on IPR issues and we
                    knew we would have to factor that into our delegation's presentation. Again, it
                    is that kind of background work that the Foreign Service does, not only for
                    Washington as a government negotiating agency, but for American business
                    because, of course, we were sharing our insights with our business colleagues in
                    Beijing and other embassies.</p>
                <p>Q: There was, of course, a foreign commercial service office, element, in the
                    embassy that was also dealing with American business presumably promoting
                    American exports, working with specific firms. How did you work with them? Were
                    they part of the same unit?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: Actually, they were a separate unit in a different building wedged
                    between the Romanian embassy and ourselves. Placing the Commercial Section in a
                    separate building was an attempt to make it more accessible to the general
                    public. It was a very dynamically run office at the time I was there. I think
                    they had a staff of four or five people, two or three of which were from the
                    Commerce Department's Commercial Service and a couple of interns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All with good Chinese.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes, all with good Chinese and a good understanding of how the Chinese
                    system operated. The Commercial and Economic sections would often share insights
                    about commercial issues and the impact of the ongoing reforms. They were the
                    first stop for arriving businessmen. Commerce would often organize industry
                    specific trade delegations, like medical instruments or something like that, and
                    maybe the Foreign Commercial Service would arrange a schedule and interviews. If
                    the delegation was from the aircraft industry, we might do join briefings
                    because joint ventures might be the focus of such a group rather than trade.
                    Speaking of civil aviation in China, one of the things we realized was that
                    Chinese civil aviation had no independent traffic control capability. The
                    military controlled the air. So, if a delegation came to sell equipment to
                    improve their airports, you don't sell it to CAAC, you sold it to the military.
                    One of the services the embassy tries to perform is to direct the American
                    businessman to the office that has the decision-making authority.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>Q: In addition to that, your two other main responsibilities were reporting on
                    the external economic side and in being involved in actual negotiation - whether
                    assisting a delegation or yourself dealing with a ministry.</p>
                <p>REUTHER: Right. And, of course, what made the job interesting and dynamic were
                    the extensive economic reforms that often that impacted on areas of interest to
                    U.S. business. So, we have an extensive reporting responsibility. We tried to
                    send economic officers around China to gain a feel for these reforms and how
                    they were being implemented. We might, for example, be interested in regulations
                    on access to foreign exchange. Such access was one of the key issues we watched,
                    because the Chinese very tightly controlled foreign exchange. In the late 1980s
                    foreign exchange issues might create strange situations. A businessman could
                    come in town and find a Chinese buyer and go back thinking he had set the
                    company up for years only to find out that the buyer doesn't have any foreign
                    exchange. To get around foreign exchange regulations the Chinese buyer might
                    suggest that the foreign company import something that the Chinese counterpart
                    could sell to earn the foreign exchange to fulfill the original contract. The
                    end result was that a foreign export might find itself committed to performing
                    export AND importing roles just because foreign exchange was so tight. So, we
                    did a lot of reporting on foreign exchange...who had it, who controlled it, what
                    the policy was. In doing this and other issues embassy officers traveled to
                    other towns to compare the central regulations with local practice.</p>
                <p>Q: How much connection was there between this economic reform that you have just
                    been talking about and the political environment. We mentioned before Tiananmen
                    Square, the student involvement in the spring and early summer of 1989. How much
                    of that ferment did you see happening? I assumed you worked somewhat with the
                    domestic political side of the embassy as well. I'm wondering, particularly from
                    the economic dimension was there a connection on the political side?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: To me there was a clear connection just because the way economic reforms
                    were implemented under Deng Xiaoping and Zhao Ziyang. In the old days if the
                    central government wanted to implement a new policy, the policy came down as an
                    order to all. Reforms in the 1980s derived from a more flexible, experimental
                    policy. Chinese think tanks were encouraged to design different policies mapping
                    how to move from a command economy to a market economy. Implementation was also
                    more experimental. Hunan experimented with one approach, Sichuan another, and
                    Yunnan a third. But the most important aspect of these experiments were the
                    articles in the papers or internal discussion about, say, how Sichuan was doing
                    with housing reform. If Sichuan's experiment looked attractive to the conditions
                    in another locality, then those officials might also pick it up. But it wasn't a
                    matter of the central government saying anymore, “Okay, all you guys do this.”
                    So, there was a lot of ferment going on out there and a lot of experimenting at
                    the local level. Both the anticipation of reform and the flexibility in
                    implementation fed into the frustration of Beijing Spring.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>We saw Tiananmen as connected with the frustration that reforms had come to an
                    important junction, but were slowing down - in Chinese eyes because, in opening
                    up the economy, corruption and misallocation of resources also emerged. The
                    banking system didn't exist and that was the only command structure the
                    government had to really keep the economy from flying off into hyper inflation
                    which, if you understand Chinese history, is something to be avoided at all
                    cost. The liberals were frustrated and were pushing an idea called
                    neo-authoritarianism. The Western translation would be “Bonaparteism” or “rescue
                    by man on a white horse,” because they couldn't figure out how to put limits on
                    the corruption and move ahead. They were looking for some dictator, some one
                    person who would wave a wand or put all the corrupt people in jail, and move
                    reforms forward. The issue was not democracy. The problem was how to move
                    forward, if corruption involved the sons and daughters of the leading elite.</p>
                <p>After all of this experimentation, all of these productive changes that had
                    happened in the agricultural economy, or these great reforms, people were making
                    money, dressing better. They had seen the Promised Land. When one young Chinese
                    woman who was assigned to work in the embassy came in a mini skirt one day, I
                    remember a colleague who had experienced China just ten year earlier — just
                    after the Gang of Four — remarking that he was astonished by the changes in so
                    short a time.</p>
                <p>I don't know if we mentioned it before but one of the things you have to
                    understand is how infectious and debilitating corruption is. When we are talking
                    about the October 1973 rioting in Bangkok, one of the problems that played into
                    that was police corruption. We talked about that and the fact that even though
                    it was the army shooting at students, the public burned down every police
                    station, because the demonstrators saw the police as corrupt and nobody was
                    doing anything about it. Well, here you have the Chinese population in the
                    spring of 1989 with this economic expansion that was being throttled in their
                    eyes by corruption and their answer was to call for a dictator to clean up the
                    corruption. They didn't see any other method of reinvigorating reform. From our
                    point of view, the spring of 1989 was not a democracy movement. We went down to
                    Tiananmen Square and talked to demonstration leaders. They did not have a
                    sophisticated understanding of democracy.</p>
                <p>Remember the demonstration leaders at first were students from the premier
                    universities, meaning they were sons and daughters of ranking party members.
                    When government put out an editorial that said the students were being
                    disruptive, student leaders took offense. In addition to their policy complaints
                    was added the issue of face. So, a lot of things came together.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>But Tiananmen was fascinating, in part, because it was a reverberation of what
                    was happening in Europe. European Communism was failing in 1989 yet Gorbachev's
                    visit in the spring and the whole things starts off in a very Chinese way, a
                    demonstration for the funeral for an honored leader was the excuse to get out
                    into the streets. Once the students were out on the streets you couldn't lock
                    the barn door. Gorbachev came, but the demonstrations caused obvious schedule
                    changes. The longer the demonstrations lasted, the more difficult for the
                    student leaders to maintain control, as new groups and students from outside
                    traveled to Beijing. It was not hard to see a parallel with the student
                    demonstrations of the Cultural Revolution. Finally, I think May 27 or 28 the
                    authorities declared martial law. Now that was a significant event. We had
                    established an office in the Beijing Hotel, which is right up from Tiananmen
                    Square. From the hotel the embassy dispatched two officers at a time, from May
                    through June, to chat with demonstrators in the square on a daily basis. Notice
                    the return on investment in Chinese language training. We didn't rely on the
                    papers, embassy officers had first hand information.</p>
                <p>Q: You don't even have to watch CNN.</p>
                <p>REUTHER: Right. We could talk to people, see who they were and see what was going
                    on. The authorities declared martial law late May, responding in large part to
                    labor and business people becoming sympathetic to the students. It was something
                    I had seen during the 1973 student demonstrations in Thailand where the general
                    public demonstrated support by offering food and drink to the students. The
                    Tiananmen students were very disciplined. They could have been civil rights
                    marchers in the 60s. They had their own security, cleaned the square and tried
                    to maximize their presentation of themselves as within the Chinese system by
                    their politeness and conduct...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we talk about the role of the embassy. To what
                        extendid incidents occur there related to what was going on at the
                        square?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>REUTHER: As I was saying earlier, the demonstration was very well organized, very
                    disciplined and very big. You have to understand that, at that time and
                    continuing to the present, the Chinese put the foreign diplomatic community in
                    compounds. The main compound is on one of the main streets that exits on to
                    Tiananmen square in a north south direction. From time to time, to keep their
                    morale up and connect with the public, the students marched out of the square
                    and around the internal beltway. That would bring them by the embassy and
                    housing compound. I don't think the Rose Bowl parade or the Macy's Thanksgiving
                    Day parade was ever as exciting as sitting up on the roof watching just miles
                    and miles and blocks and blocks of people — 10 across — marching down the road.
                    One of the more beautiful things was the parade of the motorcycle brigades.
                    Economic reforms allowed people to establish private business, the 'getihu.'
                    With their private income, one of these private business people's first personal
                    purchases was a motorcycle. So you had this motorcycle brigade of private
                    business people. Each vehicle had a small Chinese flag on the handlebar and then
                    three very large Chinese flags on poles at about the third rank. This revving of
                    the engines while going through Beijing was just stirring, I mean it had the
                    emotional impact of a marching band during a sporting event.Such parades were
                    very stirring and obviously got people quite involved. In fact, the positive
                    public response was the reason the authorities became worried and the hard-
                    liners saw things spinning out of control. What is remarkable about Tiananmen
                    Square is the push and pull between the hard-liners and the moderates right up
                    to the end. We heard rumors that the PLA was divided. The struggle between the
                    two was like the Greek myth about the sun and wind betting which one of them
                    could get a traveler to take his coat off. That is what Beijing was like up to
                    those first days in June. The Conservatives said to the Liberals, “Okay, let's
                    see if you guys can get them to stop demonstrating.” So, troops were sent in
                    unarmed without their officers and the Beijing public stopped them from getting
                    to the student center. The moderates in the government failed, the moderates in
                    the student demonstration slipped away with martial law. The streets were left
                    to the people of Beijing and a more inexperienced group of student
                    demonstrators.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>Well, if a political process started moderately, it rarely becomes softer, and
                    often reverts to harder. What happened on the night of June 4 was that the
                    hard-liners moved armed troops into Beijing and, like the Paris Commune of 1848,
                    the population of Beijing rose up. The students were a minor focus of what
                    happened that evening. The western press missed a good story by creating a
                    students versus government story. Forgotten in that story—and part of the legacy
                    for the Chinese—was the city of Beijing rose up in revolt. All the destruction,
                    all the death, was caused by the troops fighting their way into Beijing. By the
                    time the PLA arrived at Tiananmen Square, the students surrendered and were
                    marched off very easily, according to a Latin American ambassador who was near
                    the square until early in the morning. According to another account, the only
                    incident between the student demonstrators and the PLA at Tiananmen Square
                    occurred as one group of troops was escorting the students out of the square. In
                    the negotiated surrender, the students were allowed to march out with their
                    flags. However, another unit that had fought its way into town suddenly arrived
                    at the square from the south. Seeing the students with their flags, this second
                    unit apparently opened fire hitting some of the escorting troops as well as
                    students. To the extent that Tiananmen Square was more than putting down a
                    student demonstration, it was an urban uprising. The people of Beijing will
                    remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there some sort of shooting incident near or at the
                        Americaembassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Obviously on the night of June 4 there was shooting all over the place.
                    Beijing was full of tourists and business people. It became obvious that the
                    situation in Beijing was very unstable. So, all the embassies in Beijing
                    evacuated their nationals. We ultimately evacuated about 1500 Americans,
                    tourists, business people, our own embassy staff. The Japanese evacuated 4000
                    out of all of China. All the embassies slimmed down their missions. There were
                    probably fewer foreigners in Beijing on June 6, 1989, than in the last 500
                    years. Think about it. The point is that the dream of any nationalistic Chinese
                    for the last 200 years, since the first opium war, is to get the foreigners out
                    of China, because it is the foreign influence that corrupted and weakened China.
                    So, there were conservative elements in the Chinese structure that were very
                    pleased to see these departures. To them the departure of all the embassies was
                    a next logical step.</p>
                <p>Someone acted on that impulse. Across from one of the diplomatic compounds that
                    faced Jianguomen Dajie was a Japanese hotel under construction. By virtue of the
                    way housing was allocated, the Chinese knew apartment assignments among the
                    compound buildings. In the morning of June the 6th, or two days after Tiananmen
                    Square, a group of soldiers who were walking along Jianguomen Dajie in front of
                    the diplomatic compound suddenly started shooting up from the street into the
                    building.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Into which building?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Into the diplomatic housing compound, building number one. They said
                    they had received sniper fire from the roof of the building. More to the point:
                    the platoon hidden in the building across the street simultaneously poured fire
                    horizontally into building number one. Given a 10 floor building, if you are
                    shooting from the street, bullets will lodge in the ceiling the first six inches
                    or so from the window. In this case, however, you had horizontal fire poured
                    into the apartments of the American, British, Japanese and German military
                    attach�s, those same embassies' security officers, one American economic officer
                    and one Brit. They just trashed those apartments with automatic weapons fire.
                    Later the American Defense Attach� told me that he received a phone call from
                    somebody he knew in a central military unit who said don't be home at 10:00,

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, it was planned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Something was known in advance. Something whose objectivwas to scare us
                    away, to make us close all of the embassies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there casualties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: No. All the apartments were empty except for one. The American security
                    officer's kids were still there and the maid got them below the windowsill in
                    time.</p>
                <p>In retrospect, the objective of this incident was to do what the Boxers had
                    wanted to do in the summer of 1900, make the foreigners go away. This shooting
                    had a great impact on us, being shot at tends to do that to you, but we were
                    quite determined that we would not break off relations with China, they were
                    stuck with us. We would stay engaged and not be scared out. In fact, we presumed
                    the perpetrators were a small cabal of people and that there would be others who
                    were not supportive of this kind of thing. But, if we left, if we did what the
                    shooters wanted, then we would also leave the reformers naked to them.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>What is interesting about this is that the Tiananmen Incident reintroduced China
                    into American domestic politics. American politicians expressed the outrage we
                    all felt. But after a while, moralistic statements about China became just
                    another jab at one's American partisan opponent. So, a situation developed where
                    some in Congress were calling for a break in relations with China and the
                    imposition of penalties which meant the same thing. This created an interesting
                    situation where the last remnants of the Boxer Rebellion and congressional China
                    critics were making common cause, saying, “Break off contact.” And you have the
                    Bush Administration saying, “No, we have to stay engaged with China because we
                    can't let them break it off and go their own separate way.” In fact, the
                    advantage at that time of having Bush as President was that, because he had been
                    head of the earlier liaison office, he understood how important the whole issue
                    was. I believe he understood how crucial it was to maintain contact with China
                    so that we didn't lose contact with the reformers. Dealing with the Chinese has
                    its frustrations, like dealing with the French. But frustration is no excuse to
                    abandon the opportunity to educate.</p>

                <p>REUTHER: It was both frustrating and hard on morale. We were as caught up in
                    reacting to the killings as everyone else, although I had been through a similar
                    event in Thailand 16 years earlier. For those of us in the Economic Section,
                    there was little of our standard economic/commercial reporting to do. There
                    weren't going to be any negotiating delegations coming for some time either. One
                    of the interesting indices of the frustration we felt was that some of our more
                    talented compatriots turned their frustration into song. I had seen this
                    phenomena when I was in Thailand, Foreign Service officers serving in CORDS came
                    to Bangkok singing new lyrics to contemporary songs. The same happened in
                    Beijing. If I can find a couple of examples, I will add them later.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now Tiananmen Square was toward the end of your tour. What
                        otheissues were you watching?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Remember, we were talking earlier about intellectual property rights.
                    Another educational process that we closely watched was the British negotiations
                    with the Chinese over Hong Kong, the bulk of which was covered by a 99-year
                    lease that would expire in the 1990s. From the negotiating record I say much of
                    those negotiations were not negotiations but educational seminars on how the
                    British ran Hong Kong. I remember one report that talked about payroll
                    deductions. A fairly clear concept to you and I, but alien to recent Chinese
                    experience. In China you belong to a danwei, or work unit, which provides at
                    little cost to you: your schooling, your housing, your food, your recreational
                    facilities, so the wages you get are minimal and do not represent the cost of
                    labor. Well, in a free market economy, of course, you have to buy all those
                    things from your wages and save for a pension. Well, the Chinese don't have
                    that, so the British had to describe to the Chinese the connections between
                    payroll deductions, pensions and using stocks and bonds to make pensions grow.
                    No negotiating team looks bad in its own cables, but there is an educational
                    aspect to any negotiation as each side explains its perspective. In the case of
                    the discussions over the future of Hong Kong, the minutia and detail were
                    interesting to watch.</p>

                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes, some real basics. But then everything about the Hong Kong
                    negotiations was unique. Even the fact that there were negotiations, China did
                    not follow the Indian example. New Delhi extinguished Portuguese Goa by force of
                    arms. The British-Chinese talks began as a rather legalistic discussion. At one
                    point the Chinese increased the size of their delegation to involve
                    bureaucracies that had implementation, rather than legal, responsibilities. I
                    can't conceive of more complicated talks, certainly given the historical
                    animosity between the two countries.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Exactly, and that is where we are with China. People talk about
                    engagement but they are only thinking in national terms seeing China as an
                    undifferentiated whole. But, China, like the United States, is a large
                    continental society. Fortunately we have funding at the moment for five
                    consulates. But if you didn't have those consulates you really would be quite
                    blind to what is going on with the variety of reforms and the variety of
                    circumstances. That would be like saying because there is a French embassy in
                    Washington, Paris will understand Proposition 13 in California. Useful
                    intelligence it not so neatly packaged. While a French Embassy might pass on a
                    definition of Proposition 13, its consulate in California can explain in detail
                    what stimulated the idea, who is behind it, what are the chances for this local
                    movement to become national.</p>
                <p>Q: And in some ways China is even more challenging than the United States is
                    because it is so much larger and really has a lot of diversity. Dave, when you
                    were there in the economic section, were you able to travel some in the rest of
                    the country? Did you rely a lot on the consulates for reporting on what was
                    happening in their areas or did you try to get a flavor yourself of the whole
                    country?</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Well, my experience was a mixture of both. Being in the cockpit of the
                    embassy, if you will, we tasked the consulates for reporting on specific issues,
                    or to determine whether a reform being touted in Beijing was really being
                    implemented. With the consulate reporting in hand, we would combine it with
                    conversations that we had with the Chinese bureaucracies or think tanks and file
                    a report to Washington that we believed provided the best nation-wide picture. I
                    personally didn't get that much of a chance to travel. I found my schedule
                    crowded with visitors and a growing list of negotiating sessions. But, I had
                    some absolutely outstanding young officers in the economic sections and we tried
                    to free them for travel. I assumed that when they returned for a China
                    assignment ten years hence, they would have a useful sense of comparison. So,
                    officers from the economic section traveled to the port city of Tianjin from
                    time to time. Some of the limits on traveling through China were not caused by
                    our demanding schedules. Even by 1989, China's infrastructure was still rustic.
                    You could not drive from Beijing to Guangzhou on paved roads. Air travel was in
                    its infancy. To cover our district we generally traveled by train.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is near Beijing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes, Tianjin, it is Beijing's port, if you will. Actually Tianjin's port
                    is Tatu. It's the port where the allied army landed to lift the Boxer siege of
                    the legation quarter in 1900, or the Marines landed in October 1945. Tianjin was
                    a major city in northern China and the scene of local reform initiatives.
                    Fieldwork allowed us to evaluate consulate reporting and central government
                    promises. Such fieldwork is typical of how the Foreign Service with its language
                    skills works. This is the way we did it in Bangkok a decade earlier when we were
                    covering parliamentary elections. The embassy offered insights into central
                    government thinking and implementation in adjoining jurisdictions; and the
                    consulates reported the regional feel. Consulates perform an invaluable function
                    when you are looking at large continental economies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In 1989 you left Beijing. What month was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Actually that was later in the year. As you know June, July and August
                    is the usual transfer season, but because of Tiananmen Square some people didn't
                    want to return or start new assignments. So personnel informally froze the
                    normal summer transfers for a little while. I didn't leave Beijing until late
                    August.</p>
                <p>Q: Approximately four months after the incident. At the time you left how would
                    you appraise the general situation in terms of the relations with the United
                    States on the economic side? Had things begun to return to the way things were
                    before or would that take quite a while?</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>REUTHER: That would take quite a while to describe. Such a destructive event as
                    Tiananmen Square makes people who need security and stability and predictability
                    in their relationship hold back, and nobody wants stability and predictability
                    more than business people do. Even after we started summer transfers, the
                    business people stayed away. Of course, it is business peoples' interest in
                    stability which makes them good advocates for transparent laws, protection of
                    property and other accoutrements essential to underwriting the transition to
                    modernity, if not democracy. Because most countries seek economic advancement
                    they voluntarily put such instruments in place. Human rights advocates rarely
                    have such a system wide impact, and they often meet with resistance.</p>
                <p>The first few months after Tiananmen Square were quite telling. We began a series
                    of economic reports discussing the economic price China paid for Tiananmen. I
                    recall one report on the tourist industry in which we compared all international
                    flights coming into China in the pre-Tiananmen Square period versus what was
                    happening after Tiananmen. Literally everyone just stopped coming to China.
                    Tourism collapsed and most airlines simply did not fly their posted schedules.
                    Hotels, two major Hong Kong invested properties had just opened, had enormous
                    vacancy rates. Some airlines still flew. Lufthansa had a joint venture with the
                    Chinese airlines, which were being deregulated at that time, to build a service
                    center for them. So, they could not terminate all flights. They came in once a
                    week instead of four times a week. And they came in empty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they were obliged to continue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: They were obliged to continue. Cathay Pacific was doing good business
                    because all the businessmen took refuge in Hong Kong and then flew up for a day
                    or two maintain their contacts and fly back. So, Cathay Pacific and Dragon Air,
                    the two companies that flew the Hong Kong to Beijing routes, were doing okay,
                    but everybody else was dead. Hotel occupancy rate scraped along at maybe 5 or 10
                    percent. We calculated that in tourism alone Tiananmen cost China millions of
                    dollars in lost revenues.</p>
                <p>So, I would be prepared to offer the proposition that the Chinese paid dearly for
                    Tiananmen. The government understands the financial, prestige and industrial
                    price it paiIn the unintended consequences category, for example, under our
                    export control regulations, guidance systems in the Boeing airplanes that China
                    bought had to be under the control of a Boeing official. Such systems were not
                    stored with the Chinese. This meant that after Tiananmen, the Chinese Boeing
                    airplanes weren't safe to fly. The Boeing personnel had left country and there
                    was no one qualified to adjust the systems or install new equipment. They had
                    all left. By the time I left, most of the Chinese fleet could not be safely
                    flown. So, even their domestic commerce was severely damaged by Tiananmen.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>Q: I think we have covered China as vast as it is. You were there for one of the
                    major events of the last 50 years, a fascinating experience.</p>
                <p>REUTHER: You know it is funny how these things come to you. I was reading a book
                    the other day which pointed out that Herbert Hoover, who would later become the
                    U.S. president, was in Tianjin during the Boxer Rebellion and fired a rifle over
                    the parapet. So, many Americans have had interesting experiences in China.</p>
                <p>Q: After you left Beijing you went to a very different part of the world to the
                    Sudan where you were the refugee counselor there. Who were these refugees and
                    what was going on there at the time?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: The refugees were the consequence of the neighboring Ethiopian civil war
                    and the resulting man-made famine that had been going on for years. There were
                    three quarters of a million Ethiopians in Sudan under the protection of the
                    UNHCR. The refugee situation had existed so long that the international
                    community's efforts were rather routinized by the time I arrived. The UNHCR
                    supervised a number of NGOs that were providing the refugees with food, water,
                    and shelter. The American embassy's interest was to oversee the efficiency of
                    the UNHCR's performance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were interested in that because we were a major
                        financiacontributor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Exactly. That was the reporting side of this assignment. The other
                    responsibility we had was to manage a refugee settlement program from Sudan
                    based on the Southeast Asian premise that if there were refugees in these camps
                    who had a claim to either U.S. citizenship or family in the United States, then
                    we would resettle them. We had a budget that presumed that about 2,000 people
                    annually would be resettled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was far smaller than the Vietnamese
                        resettlement.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Oh, yes. But, it was substantial and very similar. Associated with my
                    office in the embassy was a contractor of 20 people who processed all these
                    people from these camps. Don't forget, you are looking at three-quarters of a
                    million people and you are going to churn them for people with connections with
                    the United States. It is a very complicated project and I think the
                    International Rescue Committee, which was the contractor in this case, was able
                    to find absolutely fabulous and dedicated administrators who accomplished this
                    job under difficult conditions. IRC's job was to attempt to identify refugees
                    who had a connection with somebody back in the United States. There was a
                    procedure back in the States for checking the claimed relationship. The IRC
                    office would then develop an elaborate genealogy on the claimant. Not only does
                    this verify the claim, but it overcomes the problem that Ethiopian refugees
                    rarely had adequate personal documentation. An interview was an important part
                    of the verification process...if you are claiming you are the brother of someone
                    in New York then one of the questions asked might be “What color was the tile in
                    the bathroom of the family home?” The same response probably meant they lived in
                    the same house. If they both identified a common neighbor, again you are drawing
                    closer to the presumption that they did live in the same house and that the
                    family relationship was established.</p>
                <p>Once you had in fact worked this case up where you concluded that the claim was
                    valid, and a refugee receiver in New York stepped forward - Lutheran Church,
                    Catholic Church, some charity - the next step was transportation to the U.S.</p>
                <p>Here is where the Sudanese came in. The Sudanese have 183 major ethnic groups in
                    their country. They don't like the Ethiopians, they don't like the international
                    community helping the Ethiopians. They, the Sudanese, are running a war in the
                    South against one of their major tribal groups. So, the whole idea of
                    international maintenance programs for refugees, or resettlement programs was
                    questioned by the Sudanese authorities. To be fair to the government, the
                    Sudanese had at an earlier time cooperative with a very similar resettlement
                    program only to find out that the refugees were being resettled in Israel. That
                    revelation brought the government down. So, Sudan paid a very high price for an
                    earlier, naive cooperation. As a consequence, by the time I arrived in late
                    1989, the Sudanese didn't want to be naive and didn't want to cooperate.</p>

                <p>REUTHER: Yes, in the Sudanese government because the Sudanese government issued
                    the exit visa. The Sudanese government meticulously required that all its normal
                    procedures for leaving the country were fulfilled. For example, that you have
                    receipted proof that your taxes had been paid. They had any number of hoops
                    created to make it very difficult for us to execute this program. My predecessor
                    had had a very difficult time with Sudanese obstructionism and had in fact only
                    been able to move about 500 people annually because of all of the
                    impediments.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>Little in my Asian experience prepared me for Sudan, which, to my eyes, was the
                    end of the earth. I concluded early on that Sudan and Burma are the two
                    potentially richest countries in the world in which the indigenous leadership
                    has deliberately driven the country into the ground. Some political leaders do
                    it inadvertently; these elites did it deliberately. Khartoum used to be the
                    winter capital for Europe. But by 1989 a drive around the city demonstrated
                    abandoned hotels and open air nightclubs. Sudanese authorities had gone Islamic
                    and closed these facilities. They took a hard conservative Islamic turn. They
                    enjoyed all the money they were making surely, but it just didn't sit well with
                    their values and when the Falasha problem (i.e., the Ethiopians covertly
                    resettled in Israel) occurred. The Sudanese just turned inward. One result was
                    the emergence of obstacles to the embassy resettlement program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any Falasha still there in the country? I think
                        there was a subsequent exodus or flight to Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes, but the subsequent exodus was out of Addis Ababa. The exposure of
                    the covert Falasha resettlement to Israel severely damaged the program as the
                    Sudanese had lost confidence in it and it had been very difficult for us to
                    recover.</p>
                <p>So, when I got there and made my initial calls on the Sudanese officials, who
                    were my counterparts. I met the General who was in charge. In fact, he had also
                    recently came to his job. We broke the ice when we realized both of us were
                    amateur World War II historians. Recognizing the problems my predecessor had and
                    that because the two of us were new to the job, I made a simple initial
                    presentation to him. I acknowledged the delays my predecessor had experienced
                    and offered that I wasn't there to waste my two years. I had a program that I
                    felt was worthwhile and we would operate it in a transparent manner in which
                    they would have no problems. But I wasn't going to repeat my predecessor's
                    experiences of dashing around Khartoum hours before the midnight airplane
                    departure scouring for last-minute permissions. It all seemed an unnecessary
                    pretense on both our parts. Either we satisfied each other's needs or Sudan had
                    to admit that it wanted us to drop the whole program. Between our common
                    interest in military history and my willingness to operate a transparent
                    program, I thought we had the grounds for a successful, professional
                    relationship. Again, humanity and professional respect goes a long way to build
                    useful business-like relationships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you could establish a certain common language?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Very much so, and I had him over to the house and had his son over to
                    the house, just the three of us, rummaging through my books and some of the
                    maps. So, we had a respectable and professional, if not personal, relationship.
                    He was very good at what he did and what he did was to guide me, not instruct me
                    but to hint at things, and I began to understand the local environment in which
                    he operated. One of the things that I was working toward correcting was the
                    residual suspicion from the earlier Falasha incident. The Sudanese officialdom
                    we dealt with were suspicious of our program but couldn't quite put their
                    fingers on why. The reality was the Falasha incident but also the Arabic
                    Sudanese didn't like refugees; they didn't like ethnic groups; they were
                    involved in a civil war in the south, so who likes refugees? Why are these
                    Americans saying they will take refugees?</p>
                <p>Once I understood Sudanese antipathy toward refugees on one hand and suspicion
                    that any country that accepted refugees must have some ulterior motive on the
                    other, I formed a plan. In fact, during this period the U.S. relationship with
                    Sudan was very strained and would remain so for years. A direct result of the
                    poor relationship was that the embassy's allocation of 7 USIA International
                    Visitors Grants was not being used. Remember in Thailand, the International
                    Visitor program was an important tool in developing Thai sensitivity to things
                    American and identifying up-and-coming Thai counterparts? I obtained the
                    ambassador's permission to use all seven grants for Sudanese officials -
                    immigration, police, tax - responsible for my program. I proposed that we sent
                    these officials on an immigrant/refugee tour of the United States. We took them
                    from the Statue of Liberty to a Hmong and Vietnamese refugee settlement program
                    in Minnesota. We scheduled cities like St. Louis to show them older immigrant
                    communities, such as the German. When they returned, they had changed attitudes
                    about what refugees and immigrants mean to America. The American public got
                    their money's worth out of that IV program because here you took skeptics,
                    people totally uninformed about the United States, and you exposed them to the
                    United States in a very directed way - an immigrant's tour of the United States.
                    Of course, they saw the Grand Canyon and other natural wonders, which was an
                    important part of underlining the parallel geographic diversity of the United
                    States. From then on I had no problems with that program. My Sudanese
                    counterparts provided me the exit visas or whatever was necessary to run a
                    smooth program.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the ambassador realized that perhaps this was the key
                        program that could function that had some advantage to the United States
                        that was going on in Sudan, whereas everything else was being
                        frustrated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Very much so, and he was very frustrated too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Ambassador Jim Cheek.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were the Ethiopian refugee camps located? Were they
                        neaKhartoum?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: No, they were adjacent to the Ethiopian border which meant they were
                    quite some distance from Khartoum. The long drive over the desert to the refugee
                    camps was depressing. You have to understand I am from Seattle, Washington, the
                    Evergreen State. God didn't want boys from Seattle to be in places like this. It
                    was absolutely desolate for miles. We would have to drive six or eight hundred
                    miles before we even got to the first camp and even at that the infrastructure
                    in Sudan was absolutely abysmal. Literally there were no places to stay.</p>
                <p>Once we flew in the military attach� aircraft, a C-12, to the Red Sea port of
                    Port Sudan. At 20,000 feet you understand how stark the terrain is. One of the
                    pilots said, “Gee if we had to land that would be it.” We could land, the
                    terrain was flat in all directions, but you would never walk out of such
                    desolate circumstances. It is an environment that is incredibly inhospitable.
                    What was running through my mind of course was the movie of Lawrence of Arabia
                    that had been done in the early 60s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that filmed in Sudan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: No, I think it was filmed in Egypt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Similar terrain.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes, similar terrain. I thought the film did a very good job of
                    illustrating the physical demands of living in the desert. But, Sudan was very
                    instructive in other ways. A haboob (dust storm) was one of the things that the
                    city of Khartoum suffered from. These storms would come from nowhere. There
                    would suddenly just be a wall of dirt coming at you, sixty or seventy feet high.
                    Sometimes it was a localized phenomenon. The haboob itself was swirling, brown
                    dust, but to the side of the storm the landscape was clear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the Nile valley there were farms. Was this just dirt
                        pickeup off the desert?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Off the desert. It was incredibly biblical. There is no protection. No
                    houses are sealed against dust. So, all your equipment, anything that is left
                    out...I had a dinner party one night and a haboob hit. An hour later we were
                    standing in the living room in typical conversational groups realizing that the
                    air in the room was so dusty, we could hardly see across it. The other biblical
                    phenomena I remember was desert rain. I was driving to work one typical, sunny,
                    100-degree day when all of a sudden I realize it is raining on the hood of my
                    car. The rain cloud was small and it was only raining on the small area directly
                    below that cloud. You could see the rain go down the street because it kicked
                    the dust as it went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was very different than Seattle or Thailand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Exceedingly. In addition to performing the embassy's oversight of UN
                    activities and managing our refugee resettlement program, I became involved in
                    one other refugee issue. The famine in Ethiopia had gone on for so long that
                    many of the NGOs had been in country for years feeding the people in Ethiopia
                    from Sudan. This program, however, had come on to bad days. The USG and AID in
                    particular had lost interest I think. So, when I arrived there was no embassy
                    involvement in this covert feeding program and there were real coordination
                    problems. Much of the grain for the program was from American AID stocks, some
                    from European supplies, all purchased by northern European NGOs. Trucking the
                    grain into Ethiopia was easy—during the dry season. American shipments became
                    erratic and arrived during the wet season which enormously complicated the
                    delivery of this vital material. One of the things I did was focus on
                    reorganizing these feeding programs.</p>
                <p>As a result of my involvement in the feeding program, the embassy in Khartoum
                    began to take a more active role in opening a dialogue with senior Tigrean and
                    Eritrean leaders that spent some time in their Khartoum offices. The two main
                    leaders were Isaias Afwerki, the Eritrean, and Meles Zenawi, the Tigrean leader.
                    Again, this demonstrates the value of a diplomatic mission overseas. The
                    Khartoum embassy had an increasingly meaningful dialogue with two movements
                    which in time would successfully come to power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were both based in Sudan at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Actually they were based inside their country and woulcome to Sudan from
                    time to time for administrative purposes.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>I should note parenthetically that our positive relationship with the Ethiopian
                    resistance movements paid an unusual dividend. I think it was early 1990 that we
                    received work that the Eritreans seized a Polish crewed ship. The Polish
                    Government asked for American good services to obtain the crews' freedom. After
                    an initial hesitation, the Eritreans did decide to release the crew into
                    American custody. The turnover would be at the Red Sea port of Port Sudan. The
                    ambassador led a small embassy group in the attach� aircraft. We flew in and
                    established ourselves in a modest local hotel. What I found fascinating was that
                    in one of the briefcases we carried was a satellite radio with which we could
                    talk to a military command in Frankfurt. After the glitches and delays, the
                    Polish crew materialized. They were very happy and clutched the small American
                    flags we presented with enthusiasm. We understand the Polish Government was
                    grateful for American assistance. We were pleased that our favorable relations
                    with the Eritreans gave us the opportunity to be of assistance. You never can
                    tell how friendships will payoff.</p>
                <p>Q: Actually Embassy Sudan probably had a monopoly on contact with the resistance.
                    They probably didn't go into Addis Ababa and had no contact with our embassy
                    there.</p>
                <p>REUTHER: Right. They would have no opportunity to do that because of the civil
                    war they were fighting against the Mengistu regime. It was this civil war which
                    resulted in famine for the people of Ethiopia. To handle the famine the
                    international community engaged in a little slight of hand. The international
                    community also administered a feeding program in Ethiopia to the population
                    under Addis Abba's control. But the central government would not allow that same
                    program to feed the population under rebel or dissident control. So, those
                    people had to be fed by the covert program from Sudan.</p>
                <p>Of course, the Ethiopian government had every interest in creating problems for
                    the program from Sudan. So, the Sudan program suffered not only from normal
                    problems, but also from Ethiopian interference from time to time. That is why I
                    think some people had backed away from it and the semi-covert program had fallen
                    on hard times.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>As I said, one of the main problems of the feeding program from Sudan was
                    delivering grain to Ethiopia before the rainy season arrived. The Scandinavian
                    NGOs had long established a sophisticated program to handle the grain. Sweden
                    even loaned them an army engineer to operate the logistics of the port of the
                    Red Sea. One of the main problems was U.S. procedures for providing relief
                    grain. American SOP was to respond when a NGOs identified a need within the
                    American fiscal year. This procedure assumes that a famine was a one-time
                    occurrence. You would not presume that you were going to have a famine next
                    year, you had a famine first and then come to the U.S. government and said you
                    needed food. The end result was, with October being the start of the American
                    fiscal year, the NGOs had to present their request in October, survive a vetting
                    process, and hope for expeditious approval. If approved, the NGO had to locate
                    the grain, then arrange shipping and get it into Ethiopia. This complicated
                    procedure created a considerable lag time. Basically the contribution I made was
                    to try to cut down on that lag time because U.S. grain, which was a third of
                    what was feeding the people, always arrived in the rainy season when it couldn't
                    be moved. When it rains in the hills of Ethiopia it looks like the eastern front
                    during World War I, it is just all slush and mud and you cannot move heavy
                    loads. So, you had a situation of where the food was coming in at the most
                    inappropriate time. So, in cooperation with the Scandinavian NGOs I spent a lot
                    of time reminding Washington that the Ethiopian/Horn of Africa famine was not a
                    one-time event and that we should plan for the long haul. After working on this
                    project for over a year, one of the greatest compliments I received was when the
                    AID director sent one of his officers over and told me I was done, meaning he
                    was taking over the program because now it was working. I took that as a success
                    even though it was a turf seizure on his part. There are other parts of this
                    story for future researchers. About the time the AID director relieved me, an
                    inspector came from AID/Washington to review the program. He sent a cable back
                    saying the program was no longer needed, and that I concurred in that judgement.
                    I wrote a restricted cable to my bosses in the Refugee Bureau underlining my
                    strong disagreement with the AID inspector. The upshot was that AID did not take
                    over the program. It was shut down. I have the uneasy suspicion that stopping
                    the feeding program was part of American pressure on the Ethiopian warring
                    parties to stop the fighting. Excellent goal, questionable means.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned the Swedish and NGOs and Europeans being active. To what extent
                    were other official representatives in Khartoum involved in both the refugee and
                    feeding programs in Ethiopia? Were the British and other European offices
                    interested too?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: They were interested in them in the same way we were. I would often
                    share notes with my British or Australian colleague on the functioning of the
                    UN, since we were both watching them and seeing that the money was properly
                    spent and that programs were in place. Like ourselves, the Canadians and the
                    Australians and the northern Europeans had refugee resettlement programs so we
                    often shared war stories along those lines. One of those stories of exasperation
                    arose from the fact that our refugee resettlement itinerary was Khartoum to
                    Frankfurt, and then to the U.S.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By charter planes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: No, regular commercial flights, Lufthansa, British Airways and Egyptian
                    Air were the only flights to Europe from Khartoum. We would get so many seats on
                    a Lufthansa flight. One of the problems that suddenly arose was that a new young
                    officer took up his posting in the consular section of the German embassy. He
                    stopped issuing transit visas for my refugees. After finally getting Sudanese
                    officialdom on board I was incredulous that the Germany embassy was my next
                    problem. It turns out that, to make up for World War II, German immigration
                    regulations now allow anybody who arrives in Germany to declare that they want
                    to stay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And some were doing that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Nobody was doing that, it was just that this consular officer presumed
                    that our refugees, going to the U.S. where they had relatives, might decide to
                    take advantage of German law and stay in Germany. By refusing transit visas he
                    thought he was preventing my refugees from choosing Germany. My argument to him
                    that these people had a very attractive situation in the United States and very
                    unattractive prospects in Germany didn't seem to sway him. In fact, I didn't
                    untangle that whole thing until we finally sent a cable up to our embassy in
                    Bonn to engage the attention of the German government which then instructed its
                    consular officer in Khartoum to be a little more forthcoming.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There probably weren't a lot of choice in routes between
                        Khartouand the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Absolutely none. There was a British Airways that came in from Athens
                    and Lufthansa that came in from Frankfurt. The Sudanese airline had regularly
                    scheduled service, but we did not avail ourselves of its services.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It probably wouldn't take you very far.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Their destinations were rather limited. I think you could fly to Cairo.
                    The Sudanese were singularly isolated. It was all part of the difficulty of that
                    environment. I don't think I have ever been in a more physically inhospitable
                    environment.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>I was also on the employees' welfare board and ran our little commissary. Our
                    little commissary was important to morale because literally there was little on
                    the local market to buy. You couldn't send your servant out and say, “Well, buy
                    some broccoli or squash for dinner.” We often had colleagues at the embassy in
                    Nairobi cut a deal with a crew member of the Kenya Air flight that arrived once
                    a week to put a box of vegetables on a plane for us.</p>
                <p>Fresh food was such a scarce commodity in Khartoum that hunting for it became
                    second nature. For example, at the Khartoum embassy, Matt Ward, who was the
                    embassy economic counselor, and I had most recently been in China. He came from
                    Shanghai and I came from Beijing. The two of us hung out at the Chinese embassy
                    from time to time because the Chinese embassy grew its own food in its walled
                    compound. By the way, the Chinese diplomats were excellent Arabic linguists. Or
                    so my Arab-speaking colleagues remarked. For Matt and I this was a chance to
                    retain our Chinese language skills and eat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Opportunity to get a decent Chinese meal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Absolutely, which was literally one of the few decent meals in town.
                    There was a Hilton Hotel, which had a restaurant, but its prices were beyond my
                    pay scale.</p>
                <p>Q: Sudan is almost the largest country in Africa and has a diverse set of ethnic
                    groups. There was a civil war going on in the south when you were there. Were
                    you involved at all in any assistance efforts to the refugees in southern
                    Sudan?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: No, because the refugees in southern Sudan had fled into Kenya, Uganda
                    and southern Ethiopia seeking safety and sustenance. We had no access to them.
                    The UN access was in the countries of refuge. The on-going civil war was a very
                    difficult thing for us and was one of the reasons for a lack of substance in the
                    bilateral relationship. The Sudanese had simply told the embassy to knock it off
                    and would not entertain any attempts on our part at mediation. It was a
                    depressing environment. The western community consisted of a few Greek and
                    Lebanese merchants and the Europeans associated with the NGOs providing services
                    to the Ethiopian refugees. Among our weekly darts companions were two fliers,
                    from Zimbabwe I believe, who flew small amounts of cargo around the country.
                    They were killed in the south and I believe the subsequent investigation
                    suggested that in fact the Sudanese army shot them down because their safe
                    journeys created the appearance that refugee activities for the people in the
                    south could be mounted from Khartoum.</p>
                <p>Q: So, to the extent that any of those activities were taking place they were
                    probably taking place at that time outside of Sudan in neighboring
                    countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes. It was really very confusing. The civil war in Ethiopia forced
                    refugees into Sudan where UNHCR and NGOs cared for them. But, the civil war in
                    Sudan pushed refugees into Kenya and Uganda where the UNHCR and other NGOs
                    organized assistance. One had the feeling that the whole horn of Africa was just
                    a disaster at that time. Of course, Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August 1990 did
                    not improve the situation in the Horn of Africa. With Iraq's invasion,
                    Washington called for a reduction in the size of our already small embassy. This
                    was in part recognition that there was nothing Embassy Khartoum could do for the
                    larger scene. Except for the refugee program, we had little positive dialogue
                    with the local Sudanese authorities. They seemed to be slipping more and more
                    into a conservative Islamic mindset. Anyway, Kuwait had priority and our
                    problems were quite insignificant. Although Washington called for a reduction in
                    the mission, the ambassador resisted.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose there was always the possibility of a terrorist
                        threat?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Absolutely, in fact, Khartoum has a violent history. Every time there
                    was a war in the Middle East somebody was shot in Khartoum. In fact, as you
                    recall, there was that major hostage incident where Ambassador Noel and his
                    deputy were murdered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was back in 1973, after the 1973 war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Then just four or five years earlier to the time I was there, there was
                    another shooting. So, Washington and we operated on the presumption that
                    Sudanese authorities could not maintain security. An important corollary was
                    that people associated with terrorism in the Middle East had offices in Khartoum
                    making it a dangerous place when the Middle East boiled over. Our first response
                    to the potential for danger was to significantly reduce our files. As I said,
                    the ambassador kept spurning Washington's instructions to cut back and prepare
                    for evacuation. After experiencing civil unrest in Thailand, then most recently
                    the Tiananmen Incident, the situation 'felt' serious to me. I also instructed my
                    contractor to reduce her files. For security's sake we brought the files and all
                    of the contractor's office equipment into the embassy building. We were taking
                    the initiative to move toward mothballing the program. Two days later we were
                    told we were leaving, the entire American diplomatic mission, any other
                    Americans, and certain other foreign nationals who also wanted to depart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was that approximately? Was it 1991 by then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes, in fact we departed Khartoum just a few hours before Desert Storm
                    started. Washington had stopped negotiating with the ambassador and ordered him
                    to close the mission and said that a New Jersey National Guard C-147 would be at
                    the airport at 9:00 in the morning. The embassy security alert system worked
                    perfectly and we all arrived at the airport at 9:00 only to find there was no
                    airplane. It could have been a dangerous situation because we gathered all the
                    potential targets in one place. The Marine Security Guards and the Security
                    officer improvised and the evacuees were spread around town in a few safe
                    locations. I was part of the group that went to the Marine House. The plane
                    arrived in that afternoon—after fixing a blown tire. The Western community
                    boarded in an orderly manner. Because this was a cargo aircraft there were no
                    seats, most people sat on the floor of this cavernous vehicle. We were flown
                    south to Nairobi. We cleared Nairobi customs and motored to the hotel arriving
                    about 12:00 midnight. Many were still wired rather than exhausted from the long
                    day and at 1:00 in the morning somebody was still up watching CNN. All of a
                    sudden there was the sound of running feet, banging on doors and loud calls:
                    Desert Storm had began.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The embassy was totally closed, the ambassador had left,

                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: While Ambassador Cheek and the staff departed, the embassy was not
                    totally closed. Two volunteers were left behind, the DCM, Joe O'Neil, and an
                    administrative officer. Joe worked out of the British embassy for security
                    reasons.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: We stayed in Nairobi only a couple of days. We were all sent back to
                    Washington except for the AID mission officers. Because of its separate
                    personnel system, AID Khartoum cut orders for its personnel that meant they did
                    not fall under the general orders to return to Washington, but remained overseas
                    on TDY.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: No. With the August invasion, Washington had decreed that all dependents
                    should leave post. By Christmas, all families had departed. Like post-Tiananmen
                    Square two years earlier, the embassy was at minimal staffing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, when you left Nairobi you went back to
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes, went back to Washington. I was fortune to land a temporary
                    assignment in an office in the Political/Military Bureau that dealt with foreign
                    military sales. This duty illustrated the changes that had occurred in American
                    attitudes since I entered the Foreign Service. Shortly before I arrived in
                    Washington in the fall of 1990, there was another military-led coup in Thailand.
                    The post-Vietnam Congress rewrote the military assistance legislation to now
                    read that a military coup was grounds for suspending U.S. military assistance.
                    So, for three months I managed the suspension of military aid to Thailand, the
                    country in which I started my career. My first assignment where the military was
                    overthrown. In the 19 years I had been in the Foreign Service, Thailand
                    demonstrated that the road to democracy and economic modernization was a rocky
                    one indeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that was just a temporary job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: That was just a temporary job. Administratively, evacuees from Khartoum
                    (and actually a large number of embassy officers from missions in Africa and
                    most of the Middle East that were severely drawdown because of Kuwait) were in
                    Washington for 30 days at a time. Every 30 days the personnel office had to make
                    a decision as to whether we would go back to post. The Gulf War, as you know,
                    lasted a relatively short time, but getting a clear idea of our status was
                    difficult. Of course, no one could tell when things would be settled enough to
                    return to as insecure a place as Khartoum. After about 90 days the Department
                    decided we could go back. I was eager to return because my programs were a
                    success and I had isolated my issues from the general unproductive relations we
                    had with the Sudanese government. In addition, I felt uncomfortable about
                    abandoning those refugees who would have been reunited with family members in
                    the States had we not left.</p>
                <p>We finally returned. International Rescue Committee (IRC), the contractor that
                    ran the screening process found new volunteers to staff its offices. We pulled
                    the files out, organized everybody and were back in business. Reestablishing the
                    program was quite an administrative challenge; to mothball the program for three
                    months and then bring it back on line.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, you were able to do that fairly quickly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes. We had the core IRC people and excellent cooperatiofrom the
                    Sudanese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were glad to see you back, no doubt. How long did you

                <p>REUTHER: I believe I returned to Khartoum in April and by mid-May received my
                    next assignment. After almost ten years, I returned to Washington. Building on
                    my previous exposure to Iraq affairs I was offered the Deputy Office Director
                    position in the Office of Iran and Iraq Affairs. In preparation for that
                    assignment I was sent to Kuwait to help reestablish the embassy's Political
                    Section. The war rather inconveniently ended before the State Department's
                    summer transfer cycle, so the Department was assigning temporary duty personnel
                    as an interim measure.</p>

                <p>REUTHER: The embassy opened shortly after Desert Storm end in late February. Part
                    of the symbolism of the restoration of Kuwait's sovereignty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were there five or six months after that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: About three or four months after the end of the war. I arrived the last
                    week in May. There was nothing ordinary about the work at post-war Embassy
                    Kuwait. Newly appointed Ambassador Gnehm arrived on the heels of the military.
                    We heard stories that he and a Special Forces unit entered the embassy, kicked
                    down the door to the ambassador's office, and looked for booby traps.</p>
                <p>Kuwait was a very interesting experience on a couple of ways. First, I had never
                    seen a battlefield before. Secondly, Kuwait must have looked like Rome after the
                    Visigoths visited. The Iraqis absolutely vacuumed up everything in the city.
                    There wasn't a screwdriver. We were put into a hotel across the street from the
                    embassy. Iraqi troops had kicked in all the doors, stole the doorknobs, stole
                    the TV, and stole the sheets. They burned the Sheraton Hotel in another section
                    of town because they couldn't loot it fast enough, damaging the top four floors.
                    The looting was total and it was not all part of the panic of a quick departure.
                    Looting was Iraq's occupation policy.</p>
                <p>Obviously it was difficult to operate; there were absolutely no supplies in
                    Kuwait. You had to bring in absolutely everything you needed. Before I arrived I
                    didn't understand is that Kuwait city is built like Los Angeleits geography
                    presumes automobiles. Well, there were no automobiles. The Iraq's took them.
                    Iraqi looting and Kuwait geography contributed on one of the rancid journalist
                    pieces of the time. The wire services carried a story that one of the first
                    ships to come into liberated Kuwait had automobiles on it. The underlying
                    message was look how selfish the Kuwaitis. In fact, the cars were desperately
                    needed because of the desert heat and a city laid out like Los Angeles.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All spread out you mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: All spread out with no public transportation and no sidewalks, but
                    beautiful freeways. So, if you understood that the city was totally dependent on
                    the automobile and the Iraqis had stolen absolutely everything with wheels, you
                    would not have been surprised that one of the first shiploads of material into
                    this looted city was automobiles, otherwise nothing could be accomplished. Of
                    course, the Kuwaitis got a great black eye for that.</p>
                <p>Then there were the oil well fires. I had seen the pictures of black clouds and
                    oil mist on the white desert sand, but wasn't prepared for the constant noise,
                    the roar. It was like sticking your ear into a jet engine. There was an
                    incredibly deafening noise. I was prepared for the dark skies and the fire and
                    the smell, but it was the noise took me unawares as we traveled through
                    Kuwait.</p>
                <p>As an officer in the Political Section I had some internal reporting
                    responsibilities, but was primarily recruited to work with the United Nations
                    organization and the NGOs who were trying to cope with the refugee problems and
                    the restoration of infrastructure services. Work similar to my Khartoum
                    duties.</p>
                <p>Q: Were you doing some reporting?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: We were doing some reporting, but primarily coordinating with the UN.
                    The Department wanted someone who understood the issues, who knew the UN, what
                    its offices were capable of doing and what we should expect of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you in Kuwait?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Not very long, six weeks, through the 4th of July — a memorable Fourth
                    of July to be in liberated Kuwait. I know this assignment was six weeks, because
                    more than that and the regulations require the Department to pay TDY. I returned
                    to the States on July 15.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you come home to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: As I mentioned earlier, I had experience with Iraq and we all realized
                    that post-Gulf War policy toward Iraq would remain a major and delicate policy
                    area. Ambassador David Mack was the Deputy Assistant Secretary in the Bureau of
                    Near East Affairs and knew my work. He recruited me as deputy to Ron Neumann on
                    the Iraq/Iran Desk. So, I returned to Washington as Ambassador Neumann's deputy.
                    His focus was mainly Iranian issues and I covered Iraq and managed the office.
                    It was indeed a substantive assignment at a propitious time.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, this was the period right after the war and there
                        presumablwasn't very much interaction between us and Iraq.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: No, none at all. Our primary objectives at that time were two-fold.
                    First, to maintain the coalition that had resisted the invasion of Kuwait, and
                    secondly, see that Iraq fulfilled its obligations to the United Nations. The
                    conflict had ended in an armistice (vice a surrender) in which Iraq was required
                    to perform certain functions - get rid of its weapons of mass destruction,
                    acknowledge Kuwait's existence, demarcate the Iraq- Kuwait the border—before the
                    UN embargo was lifted. Actually there were approximately 15 specific steps
                    enumerated in the UN armistice resolution. So, our job was to monitor Iraq's
                    compliance with these requirements. At this time there was a certain naivet� on
                    the part of coalition allies that Saddam would do the smart thing, the rational
                    thing, and get out from underneath the UN embargo by quickly fulfilling Iraq's
                    armistice obligations. Given the brutal suppression of the Shiite rebellion in
                    the south and the Kurdish rebellion in the north, the European coalition members
                    should have had a more bracing view of the situation. Our major problem in the
                    Department was that Saddam, obviously, had more independent plans and, rather
                    than compiling with the UN resolutions (which might have cost him power in Iraq)
                    basically was willing to wait the coalition out. Iraqi policy assumed that if
                    Baghdad hunker down, then the coalition would fall apart. So, Iraq's post-war
                    policy of believing that the coalition would not hold together was not that
                    different from Saddam's pre-war assumptions.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>When I took this position, I was aware of the considerable debate in this country
                    as the public and the Congress struggled for understanding. As often happens,
                    much of this is Monday morning quarterbacking. Some American commentators argued
                    that U.S. policy contributed to Saddam's misreading of the situation in August
                    1990. One of the best academic pieces on the issue of 'could Saddam have been
                    dissuaded' is by Janice Gross Stein, 'Deterrence and Compellence in the Gulf,
                    1990-91: A Failed or Impossible Task? International Security, Vol. 17, Nbr. 2
                    (Fall 1992). Professor Stein's conclusion is that because Baghdad discounted
                    American and European opposition, it probably could not have been deterred from
                    the invasion. I believe that Saddam's calculation was impeccable. He was deeply
                    in debt due to the recently concluded Iran-Iraq war, although his Arab neighbors
                    contributed considerable funds Iraq's drubbing of the Persians. Rich Kuwait was
                    there, viewed condescendingly by most of its poorer neighbors and Iraq owed
                    major money to Kuwait. Extinguishing Kuwait eliminated a major debt and provided
                    substantial future revenue. Who would oppose Baghdad? Not the Iranians; they too
                    are exhausted from eight years of war. The Syrians are Iraq's traditional
                    political foes, but they are not big enough to take on the largest army in the
                    Middle East and perhaps the fourth largest in the world. As to the Europeans,
                    the French won't object. Baghdad owes Paris so much money that it wouldn't
                    jeopardize its creditor. The debt situation is similar with the Germans and
                    other Europeans. And even if they object, what does that mean? Certainly nothing
                    militarily significant. Saddam might have considered that the Americans would
                    object. There will be a lot of American hand wringing and UN resolutions, but
                    because nobody else will go along with the Americans, they will be isolated in
                    their objection. Even if the Americans try to do something militarily, if you
                    look at what they just did in Panama, they made a total mess out of it as the
                    world press had told everybody. So, thinks Saddam, if the Americans weren't
                    militarily effective next door in Panama, how are they going to effectively move
                    10,000 miles into the Middle East? And, anyway, where are the Americans going to
                    plant themselves? Washington can't make common cause with Tehran. Saudi Arabia
                    is the protector of the holy Islamic places and the idea that armed infidels
                    would be allowed into Saudi Arabia was beyond anybody's comprehension. Saddam's
                    calculations were impeccable to a point. And that point was the moment he
                    invaded Kuwait. His action changed the calculus. The Kuwaitis actually put up a
                    stiff resistance in the first few hours and shot down a command helicopter. From
                    the helicopter they retrieved papers that suggested Saudi Arabia was in
                    jeopardy. The Kuwaiti success and the enormous vulnerability of Saudi Arabia to
                    further Iraqi moves made the Saudis more afraid of Saddam than they were of
                    armed infidels.</p>
                <p>Q: Back to your Washington assignment. Of course there were a couple of other
                    issues that presumably were being dealt with at that time by Saddam but also of
                    interest to us, the Kurds in northern Iraq and the Shiite in the south. Were
                    those of interest to you?</p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Very much so. As a matter of fact just before I arrived in Washington,
                    Baghdad had suppressed rebellions in both the northern and southern parts of the
                    country. Baghdad's policies toward these two areas combined military action and
                    economic embargo. The coalition's Operation Provide Comfort provided relief
                    supplies to the landlocked Kurds in the north. At the end of Desert Storm UN
                    relief organizations established themselves throughout Iraq, but Iraqi
                    authorities slowly began squeezing them out. And so started the tug-of-war
                    between the UN and Saddam over each of the UN's armistice requirements Iraq was
                    to fulfill before the embargo could be lifted.</p>
                <p>The UN embargo never included food and medicines, but banned the sale of Iraqi
                    oil so that Baghdad could not rearm. If Iraqi did not rearm, some thought, more
                    resources would be available to pay Iraq's war debts and maintain its
                    population. The flaw in that thinking was that Saddam had less interest in his
                    population than the international community did.</p>
                <p>First, Baghdad instituted an ironclad embargo against the Kurdish areas in the
                    north. No food, no money, no salaries, nothing passed from central Iraq to the
                    Kurdish areas. Our aerial photography confirmed refugee stories. At Iraqi army
                    checkpoints in the north were oil barrels into which all travelers had to
                    dispose of anything they carried, be it food, money or extra clothing. Nothing
                    passed through Baghdad's internal embargo. The Shiites in the south suffered a
                    similar fate. The UN humanitarian agencies that came to Iraq after Desert Storm
                    quietly told of the difficult situation in the south. Because they had offices
                    in Baghdad, they knew there were supplies in central Iraq that simply were not
                    being provided to the rest of the country. As I mentioned, the Iraqis harassed
                    the UN people, who being afraid for their own safety began to pull out.</p>
                <p>Faced with what Saddam was doing to the Iraqi people, we spent considerable time
                    developing the international community's response. For example, a rebellion
                    continued in the swamps on the Iran and Iraq border. Intelligence told of a
                    heavy Iraqi hand throughout the Shiite south. Taking a cue from the north we
                    worked closely with coalition members and instituted the southern no-fly zone.
                    This program denied Baghdad air cover for its troops and meant we would fly very
                    low level reconnaissance. The southern no fly zone was also a response to
                    Baghdad's increasingly obvious unwillingness to recognize Kuwait's independence
                    and demarcate the border. In fact, Iraq began to move military equipment toward
                    the Kuwait border. Needless to say, the Kuwaitis felt very intimidated. Our
                    counter to Iraq's military moves and the southern no- fly zone and the
                    emplacement of a move-it-or-lose-it policy. This was one small illustration of
                    what happened on my watch and that of my successors. Saddam would challenge the
                    coalition looking for some hole we would not plug, stretching the patience of
                    the coalition, and looking for the point where the coalition would crack.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>So, this became an assignment in coalition politics, not only at the highest
                    level, but down at our office level. Maintaining coalition presence and
                    consensus was the watchword. The British embassy assigned one officer to work
                    with us on a daily basis. We were in constant contact with the other embassies.
                    The Assistant Secretary and his deputies were often talking either to other
                    capitals or their Washington embassies as we tried to maintain the coalition and
                    maintain the consensus to hold Saddam to his obligations. It was a very, very
                    heavy demonstration of diplomatic prowess on the part of the very professional
                    people in this bureau.</p>
                <p>Q: At that time there was, of course, an Iraqi mission to the United Nations
                    located in New York. Was there any Iraqi presence as part of another embassy in
                    Washington?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes, there was. They had an interest section near Dupont Circle just as
                    they had when I was the Iraq desk officer 16 years earlier. Algeria was still
                    the protecting power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they had a few diplomats here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: They had one person left. The officer who had been ambassador had fled
                    to Canada by then. He didn't seem to have any interest in going back to
                    Baghdad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you on the desk talk to this one individual or did
                        you insist on dealing with them in New York or through the Algerian
                        embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: We had no need to talk to the person in Washington. We had no bilateral
                    relations. We dealt with Iraq in New York through our UN mission because it was
                    UN requirements to which the coalition were holding Baghdad. Besides, the
                    officer in Iraq's Washington mission had no standing with his own people back in
                    Baghdad and was very low echelon. So, he was not an appropriate and responsible
                    channel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else you would like to say about your
                        time iIran/Iraqi affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>REUTHER: We should mention that not only was the coalition working to see that
                    Saddam complied with the armistice his representatives signed, it was also
                    concerned about the Iraqi population. As Saddam delayed compliance, the health
                    and welfare of the Iraqi people became another wedge to attack the coalition.
                    The UN embargo excluded food and medicine and the UN established a committee
                    mechanism to approve imports so that Saddam could not rebuild his military. We
                    knew what Iraq was importing and that it was only importing minimal amounts of
                    food and medicine. If Saddam could misconstrue the embargo in the world press
                    and induce famine in the population, the coalition would be under significant
                    pressure. The responses we came up with were UN Security Council Resolution 706
                    and 712. Under this mechanism the international community would allow Iraq to
                    sell oil for the explicit purpose of buying the food and medical supplies that
                    it needed. As I mentioned, food and medicine never were embargoed; what was
                    embargoed was the sale of oil, so Iraq all along was buying food and medicine,

                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Well, actually Saddam and the Iraqi elite, which was primarily the
                    Takriti clan, had ample financial resources. The international community was
                    feeding the Kurds in the North and now had to devise a system for the rest of
                    the Iraqi population. Iraq's noncompliance with the simplest armistice terms had
                    convinced most coalition members that the Iraqi leadership could not be trusted.
                    So, resolutions 706/712 were written to require oversight. We wanted to make
                    certain the UN would monitor the food into the country to see that the people
                    actually got it. The foreign community wasn't interested in just providing food
                    for Saddam's family; its interest was in the people of Iraq.</p>

                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>REUTHER: It was U.S. stimulated and we worked diligently to sell the plan. We
                    were responding to a feeling that the international community shared: Saddam was
                    starving his own population and we ought to make some effort to do something
                    about it. But, of course, that is exactly the point. Saddam was starving his
                    people to create the image that it was the international community's fault
                    brought about by it embargo on the sale of Iraqi oil. So, we turned it around
                    and said the international community will let Saddam sell the necessary oil but
                    he has to assure us, since we have lost all confidence, that the Iraqi people
                    will receive the food. Well, there you go, the last thing Saddam wants is food
                    to get to the Iraqi people and UN monitoring because he, of course, is squeezing
                    down on UN presence. The UN inspection teams seeking Iraq's programs for weapons
                    of mass destruction received the most pressure. The UN inspectors would wake up
                    in the morning to find all the windows in the UN vehicles were broken. Or, they
                    were kept up all night with telephone calls to their hotel rooms. Their clothes
                    were stolen. The Iraqi harassment of these UN teams is just unbelievable and
                    unnoticed in the press in the months immediately after the war. When I left the
                    Desk, Resolutions 706/712 were in place, but spurned by Saddam. I believe we
                    succeeded in keeping the coalition together and focusing the coalition on the
                    issues of Iraq's compliance with the UN armistice resolution.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Yes, that's right. It was an excellent opportunity to see how our
                    colleagues in the Department of Defense operated. Having been overseas with
                    members of the uniformed services and having worked with DOD representatives in
                    interagency groups, I thought it would be a good education to see issues from
                    the other side. This exchange program was a long standing one that placed
                    Foreign Service officers in the military commands and in the Office of the
                    Secretary of Defense's International Security Affairs (ISA) Bureau while
                    uniformed officers had tours in the State Department's regional bureaus and the
                    Bureau of Political Military Affairs.</p>
                <p>I see a strong need for DOD and State and have such exchange programs. After a
                    series of frustrating meetings, and I have forgotten the subject, I was asked by
                    my ISA colleagues why State was so difficult. With a little exploration we
                    determined that the difference in approach to the issue at hand was that State
                    was concerned about the impact of proposed U.S. moves on the domestic situation
                    in the country in question. State was looking for a solution that supported the
                    reformers and blocked the conservatives. DOD was pushing for a solution parallel
                    to the way the U.S. would handle the issue, regardless of the domestic
                    consequences in the target country. DOD and State are players on the same team
                    and such insights help teamwork. Of course, these off-line programs are
                    expensive for the sending agency and they always are under threat of shrinkage
                    from budgetary considerations. As I was winding up my tour, I failed to receive
                    a short extension because State's Seventh Floor reduced and realigned the
                    program.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What particularly did you work on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: I was assigned to ISA, which is often called the Pentagon's mini State
                    Department. ISA provides policy guidance to the Secretary of Defense on a
                    regional basis. So there is a Latin American office, an Asia-Pacific office,
                    etc. Given my background I sought the position in the Asia-Pacific office. In
                    the Fall of 1993 my first major assignment was to support the one-person Korea
                    Desk in the Asia-Pacific office. The Secretary of Defense was scheduled to
                    attend the annual Korean-American defense consultations. In addition to
                    organizing the briefing books for the traveling party, I also accompanied the
                    group. It was a busy week. There were formal calls, the conference, and a
                    simulation exercise for some of the delegation members. I took the opportunity
                    to visit Panmunjom on the border, the U.S. Army's 2nd Division - the primary
                    U.S. force on the Korean Peninsula, and the U.S. Air Force facilities at Osan.
                    Once the Secretary's visit was completed, I was permanently assigned to handle
                    Taiwan, Australia and New Zealand affairs. I often joked that if it had water
                    around it I was responsible for it.</p>
                <p>Q: This was from 1993-95 and you were working not only with the civilian side of
                    the Department of Defense, but also with the Joint Chiefs on the military side,
                    and I suppose to some extent with the State Department as well.</p>
                <p>REUTHER: Oh, absolutely. Only this time when I went to interagency meetings I was
                    the “them.” In Asia-Pacific we worked closely with the Joint Chiefs staff,
                    especially with J-5. New for me, we also worked closely with the Defense Attach�
                    office of the respective embassies of our countries. I thoroughly enjoyed
                    liaison with the Australian and New Zealand attach� offices.</p>
                <p>I had worked with colleagues from Australia and New Zealand overseas, but this
                    was a first opportunity to look closely at our bilateral relations. From the DOD
                    perspective these are the most intimate security relationships we have in the
                    post-WWII era. The Anglo-Saxon immigrant bond was strong. The AUSCANZUKUS
                    countries (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, UK, and U.S.) constituted a special
                    inner circle in the American security relationship. I was surprise, therefore to
                    find a significant bilateral problem in our security relationship with New
                    Zealand.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>REUTHER: Exactly. At issue was a series of policy moves in New Zealand when the
                    Labour Party came to power in the mid-1980s. The country immediately fell victim
                    to economic problems that Labour handled via policies that might best be
                    associated with its opposition, the conservatives. To burnish its credentials
                    with its electorate, Labour indulged its anti-nuclear wing that was upset with
                    French atomic tests in the neighborhood. And the French endeared themselves to
                    New Zealand by blowing up a nuclear-test protesting Greenpeace ship in
                    Wellington Harbor. I believe someone was killed in that incident. As a
                    consequence the new Labour government publicly announced that it would challenge
                    the U.S. Navy's nuclear 'Neither Confirm Nor Deny' policy. Not only did Labour
                    want to ban nuclear weapons, but also nuclear power. To demonstrate the
                    emotionalism of the issue, there is a very famous Wellington newspaper cartoon
                    at the time that pointed out that one receives more radiation from the
                    anti-cancer ward of the hospital than a visiting nuclear powered vessel.</p>
                <p>Be that as it may, what Labour's policy meant was that New Zealand effectively
                    opted out of its ANZUS treaty obligations. By the end of the 1980s rather than
                    find a workaround so that both domestic and treaty obligations might be
                    satisfied, Labour enshrined its anti-nuclear policy into legislation. So, you
                    had an alliance partner who said that he would not allow you to perform your
                    full functions as an alliance partner and he would not perform his full alliance
                    role. New Zealand's policy shift took place against the background of the Soviet
                    incursion into Afghanistan and the increase in Soviet naval presence in the
                    Pacific. The Reagan Administration decided that New Zealand was no longer an
                    alliance partner.</p>
                <p>New Zealand's stand, of course, presented difficulties for the alliance, not only
                    for what New Zealand did, but also for the precedent it set. Had Japan or some
                    of the European powers taken the same stand, the U.S. alliance structure would
                    have been fatally wounded. Punishment for New Zealand's anti-nuclear stand was
                    withdrawal of intelligence cooperation, loss of access to latest military
                    equipment, a ban on military to military training and a lowering of the level of
                    contacts. Over time New Zealand's government also cut back on military budgets.
                    American and New Zealand policies combined to leave the New Zealand military in
                    worsening shape.</p>
                <p>In the mid-1990s we praise the idea of the 'democratic peace,' that something
                    inherent in democratic states prevents them from falling into conflict. New
                    Zealand's anti-nuclear policy does not contradict this paradigm. Yet, I think
                    the paradigm missed the point that for domestic reasons the Labour Government
                    created a problem in its foreign relations. A problem that it was unwilling to
                    resolve by devising a workaround so that it could maintain its international
                    responsibilities and satisfy domestic audiences. My observation is that any
                    country, including the United States, that is only willing to fulfill domestic
                    demands and turn its back on its larger international responsibilities will in
                    time create grave problems for the larger community.</p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>At the time I was in the Pentagon, the New Zealand position was that no
                    government had the ability to repeal the anti-nuclear legislation. Nevertheless
                    a Conservative Government was in power and it signaled that it wished a closer,
                    but perhaps not alliance, relationship. Part of Wellington's epiphany was that
                    during Desert Storm, New Zealand volunteered warships to the coalition for Gulf
                    duty but realized that its vessels experienced difficulties coordinating with
                    the other Anglo-Saxon navies because New Zealand's tactics and equipment were
                    out of date. So, the Conservative Government probed for readmission to the inner
                    core. We went through an interagency policy review. Was there some way we could
                    encourage New Zealand to abandon its anti-nuclear position either in de jure or
                    de facto that would then allow us to repair the relationship? There was little
                    support for rehabilitating New Zealand without some contrition or some mutual
                    excuse so that other countries could not use New Zealand's position as a
                    precedent. The Navy was most adamant on the issue.As I said, the NSC initiated
                    an interagency review of our policy, in approximately 1994, I think. Our options
                    were limited. New Zealand may have wanted to be reinstated in the Anglo-Saxon
                    security world, but in the interviewing years it had allowed its military to
                    atrophy. The single exceptions were the ANZAC frigates being jointly built with
                    Australia. And it wasn't certain whether New Zealand would fulfill its
                    obligations to this program. Otherwise, what equipment New Zealand had had not
                    been updated in recent years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did Australia think about the problems in
                        American-NeZealand relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Since the coves of Gallipoli in World War I, Australia and New Zealand
                    have had a unique and close relationship. On this issue, however, Canberra, was
                    unsympathetic to Wellington. A Labour Government also came to power in Australia
                    in the mid-1980s and maneuvered around the pressures of its own anti-nuclear
                    faction. So, it was not sympathetic to New Zealand Labour's handling of the
                    issue. On the other hand, Australia sought to soften New Zealand's fall from
                    grace. As a result Australia was very interested in U.S. policy on New Zealand
                    and we fully shared our thinking about our policy options. We would not have
                    changed our relationship with New Zealand without consulting Canberra.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>As I mentioned, an interagency policy review under an NSC chair was launched in
                    January 1994. We would have liked to find a workaround. Consensus formed around
                    the idea of increasing the level of contacts. That is, reversing our policy of
                    only allowing mid-level contacts. As down payment on the new policy, CINCPAC
                    Admiral Larson made a trip to New Zealand. I provided inputs to his talking
                    points. A CINCPAC trip was fitting, because it was the U.S. Navy's 'Never
                    Confirm, Nor Deny' policy that Wellington challenged. Admiral Larson made a
                    number of speeches and received good coverage in the New Zealand media. We saw
                    Admiral Larson's and other trips as responding to the New Zealand leadership's
                    desire that we make our case to the New Zealand public and hopefully begin to
                    give the government some leeway on these issues. Assistant Secretary of State
                    Winston Lord followed Admiral Larson in August 1994, the State Department's
                    Deputy Secretary included New Zealand in a January 1995 trip and the Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary of Defense, who happened to be an FSO, Kent Wiedemann,
                    accompanied Talbott. The next American move following these trips was to extend
                    an invitation to Prime Minister Bolger to call on the White House.</p>
                <p>One of the symbolic ways of expressing our isolation of New Zealand since the
                    mid- 1980s was to lower the level of official contact. We assumed that because a
                    PM- Presidential meeting was a significant unilateral gesture, it would allow
                    the current government to take some step that we could use to declare New
                    Zealand's isolation ended. We had in mind an action such as repealing the
                    legislation on visits of nuclear powered vessels. These power plants had proven
                    their safety and the number of American nuclear powered ships in the categories
                    that might visit New Zealand were declining. On the contrary when New Zealand's
                    invoked anti-nuclear power legislation in the 1980s, the percentage of nuclear
                    powered ships in the U.S. Navy was increasing.</p>
                <p>Prime Minister James Bolger came to the U.S. in late March 1995. On that trip he
                    called on the Secretary of Defense, met with the President, and lunched with the
                    Secretary of State. As the DOD New Zealand Desk officer I produced the scope
                    paper, talking points and background material for the SECDEF's meeting with PM
                    Bolger. I also attended the session. The Prime Minister's visit was a major
                    attempt to change our security relationship with a country I had been associated
                    with since my early tours in Thailand. Like my counterparts at the New Zealand
                    embassy, I had high expectations for this meeting. Unfortunately, the New
                    Zealand leadership pocketed this meeting and was unable to provide any
                    substantial reason for us to restore the previous security cooperation. At the
                    time we were sending these positive signals to New Zealand, parliamentary
                    elections were not far off. Some believed that Wellington would have to respond
                    to us before the elections, because they would be held under a new electoral
                    system that made it unlikely that any party would be a majority party. Skeptics
                    voiced the thought that the Conservatives were using us to bolster their
                    electoral prospects. By the time I left Asia-Pacific Affairs, nothing came of
                    our effort to construct a new relationship that would allow the restoration of
                    New Zealand's place in the AUSCANZUKUS security circle.</p>

                    wasn't part of the alliance relationship. It was strictly scientific.</p>
                <p>Q: You mentioned that you worked closely with Australia on New Zealand policy.
                    What were other aspects of our relationship with Australia that you recall?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: As a Foreign Service officer in Asia I always worked closely with the
                    local Australian embassy. In a place like China where the Americans often had
                    more language skills, officers from the English speaking embassies, such as the
                    Australians, would often meet and share notes. The tour in the Pentagon,
                    however, underscored for me the intimacy in Australian-American relations that I
                    consider remarkable. The U.S. military has many exchange programs with foreign
                    militaries, but our exchange with Australia was extensive. To the point where
                    Australian officers were holding billets in the Pentagon in fields such as
                    logistics and procurement. Australia was fully integrated into the inner core of
                    the American security establishment. Cross training and mutual exposure built
                    high levels of confidence when events such as Desert Storm arose.</p>
                <p>You could see this remarkable relationship in the work of the Australia Desk. An
                    arrangement had developed over the years where the Director of Asia-Pacific
                    Affairs (that is, the #2 position in our office, usually a one or two star
                    military officer) had a formal quarterly meeting with the Australian Military
                    Attach�. These meetings were called the HADS-ISA meetings (e.g., Head of
                    Australian Defense Service). Military attaches from other countries had good
                    working relations and easy access to the Desk officers and our bosses, but these
                    formal meetings were particularly symbolic of our close relationship of
                    Australia. Because our relationship was so rich, these meetings provided a
                    centralized venue for raising any security related issue. The agendas that I
                    prepared for these meetings were extensive and covered not only our policy
                    toward some world event, but the status of mutual scientific projects and the
                    constant coordination on New Zealand policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>Also symbolic of the intimacy of the relationship were the annual Australian
                    Ministerial meetings. I'm not certain when they started, but they certainly were
                    the highlight of my tour. These were annual cabinet-level meetings that
                    alternated between capitals. In 1994 the venue was Canberra, 1995 Washington.
                    These were major administrative events because protocol called for both the
                    secretaries of Defense and State to attend. It is a project of enormous
                    proportions to coordinate the schedules of these two American cabinet officials.
                    Once the AUSMIN was tentatively on their schedule, my State Department
                    colleague, the Australian embassy and I began to work on an agenda. The agenda
                    would cover the waterfront. There wasn't an international subject that wasn't
                    covered. Furthermore, there was an extensive communiqu� to negotiate. The
                    communiqu�, of course, illustrates the connection between foreign and domestic
                    policy because it was as much for the domestic audiences as mutual allies and
                    neighbors. One of the difficult aspects of the whole proceedings, however, was
                    to arrange the topics so there would be sufficient and substantive topics for
                    each American cabinet official to address in the meetings. This was the job of
                    the working level. There were murmurings from the immediate staffs of the
                    secretaries of State and Defense over the allocation of topics, but such turf
                    questions were to be expected.</p>
                <p>The Australians hosted my first AUSMIN (as was our shorthand for these meetings)
                    in Canberra. Ultimately the Secretary of Defense dropped out of the schedule and
                    the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy, Ambassador Frank Wisner, headed the
                    DOD contingent. This was my first time in Canberra. The Australians were
                    gracious hosts and a number of our embassy officers in Canberra were FSOs with
                    whom I had served in other posts. The meetings were held in the unassuming
                    Cabinet room of the new Parliament building. While in town I had my own full
                    schedule of meetings with a spectrum of Australian officials, including
                    representatives of the Prime Minister's office, the Department of Defense, and
                    the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. I also took advantage of the
                    opportunity to visit the War Museum in Canberra and the Navy command center in
                    Sydney.</p>
                <p>The second AUSMIN was in Washington. Again, the job of the desk officer was to
                    accomplish the preliminary coordination between State and Defense and the
                    Australian embassy. Next task was to commission background papers that provided
                    a snapshot of the subjects to be covered. Working closely with State's Desk we
                    coordinated and cleared the talking point papers from which the principals would
                    speak. Closer to the event one would draft the scope paper that provided an
                    overall view of where this meeting fit into the relationship, what the other
                    side hoped to accomplish, and finally what we hoped to accomplish. After the
                    appropriate clearances, these papers were put together in a briefing book, at
                    least three inches in this case, and passed forward to the principal, with
                    copies to the deputies who would also attend the meetings. Always a frantic time
                    meeting the deadline for these briefing books. Nevertheless, briefing books are
                    an invaluable photography of a relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>One final thought on the relationship with Australia is an observation about how
                    democracies interact. One of my main projects was the preparation of the Annual
                    Facilities Report. For decades Australia's contribution to the alliance was the
                    provision of space for joint facilities that performed a number of defense
                    monitoring functions. The Labour opposition liked to characterize the joint
                    facilities as “U.S. bases” or as performing functions the Australian public
                    would not approve. At one point the slow response to a question in Parliament
                    about some construction at one of these facilities embarrassed the party in
                    power. As a result, at least through the 1980s, the Australia desk officer
                    queried the U.S. uniformed services that had equities in these joint facilities
                    what our plans were. In my turn I gathered these responses and coordinated them
                    into a report which was then forwarded to Canberra via the Australian embassy's
                    defense attach�. The irony is that one of my duties was to assist the Australian
                    government fend off potential domestic political attacks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did I remember you saying that you were also desk officer
                        foanother island, Taiwan. How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: When I arrived at Asia Pacific Affairs Eden Woon covered all China
                    issues. Post-Tiananmen sanctions restricted military-to-military contacts with
                    Beijing and contacts with Taiwan were predictable. Dr. Woon had come to the
                    position of Head of the China desk while he was still in the Air Force. In late
                    1994 he left ISA/AP to become director of the Washington State China Relations
                    Council in Seattle. So, I added the Taiwan desk officer duties to my portfolio
                    for about the last 12 months of my assignment to the Pentagon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Beijing-Taipei issues are in the news all the time now,
                        wasn'that taking on a heavy load?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: By this time an office reorganization allowed me to turn over my Korean
                    responsibilities to a new officer. So, the portfolio balance remained. But your
                    are right, Australian and New Zealand affairs dominated my attention. In mid to
                    late 1994 we were in the midst of another round of Inter-Agency Working Group
                    meetings on the Australian South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone proposal. Australia
                    and New Zealand had long expressed interest in a nuclear free zone. Some
                    fruitful international discussions had been held, but the Reagan Administration
                    lost interest. This was just one of a number of issues the Clinton
                    Administration was reinvestigating. I was the lead ISA representative to the
                    interagency meetings, most of which an NSC representative hosted. Our position
                    was that nuclear free zones were a function of the Cold War, President Bush had
                    removed nuclear weapons from U.S. naval vessels, and therefore the issue was
                    overtaken by events (OBE). Law of the Sea concerns and U.S. Navy views were a
                    large part of our disinterest. State was also not interested. Peripheral
                    agencies interested in the issue were not strong enough to move the issue
                    forward. As I was saying, though, as to Taiwan we were in the calm before the
                    storm.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give us a flavor of the Taiwan issues that did
                        come tyour attention?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: Our priority issues were maintaining the unofficiality of the
                    relationship with Taiwan and organizing our best judgement on the issue of arms
                    sales to Taiwan. The Clinton Administration, as it had with New Zealand policy
                    and other issues, conducted an interagency review of policy toward Taiwan. Given
                    the political sensitivity of the relationship, State was the lead agency. That
                    policy review was completed around July of 1994 and announced around September,
                    just before I accepted the Taiwan portfolio. So, I did not participate in the
                    policy review, but kept abreast of the issues during the twice-weekly office
                    staff meetings.</p>
                <p>The end result of the Taiwan policy review were a few changes in procedure and
                    nomenclature. CCNAA changed its name to the “Taipei Economic and Commercial
                    Representative Office.” Fair enough. CCNAA don't specifically refer to Taiwan or
                    Taipei. On the grounds that trade had grown, economic officials of the two
                    authorities could meet in each other's office. For everyone else, in order to
                    underscore the unofficiality of the relationship, American Institute in Taiwan
                    and TECRO offices were the unofficial meeting places of choice.</p>
                <p>For DOD, the policy review meant no changes. Because officers in uniform and
                    government arms sales imply officiality, new rules about Taiwan representatives'
                    access to U.S. Government agencies did not affect DOD as they did Commerce and
                    State departments. DOD equities required strict adherence to the unofficiality
                    of the relationship with Taiwan and DOD continued to work through the AIT office
                    in Rosslyn, Virginia.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>Despite all the pro-Taiwan fuss in the media at the time, it is not clear that
                    the interagency group could have changed much. The Republic of China, that is,
                    the authorities on Taiwan, is the successor government to the Qing dynasty, and
                    our normalization with the People's Republic of China meant that the PRC was the
                    successor to the ROC. To illustrate this legitimacy linkage, one of the first
                    requirements the USG made of the PRC was that it resolved the issue of the Kwang
                    Hua Railroad bonds from the Qing Dynasty. Any activity then that supports the
                    officiality of the ROC impinges on the legitimacy of the PRC. This was
                    particularly true during the 1970s and 1980s when the ROC unequivocally argued
                    that it was the government of China of which Taiwan was a province. The
                    contemporary PRC claim is a reflection of the earlier ROC claim. Calling on the
                    ROC to change its name so that it is no longer the successor government to the
                    Qing runs into problems on the Taiwan side. The political party that ruled
                    Taiwan from 1945 to the present is the Kuomintang. It legitimized its rule and
                    hence financial and power position in Taiwan on the grounds that it was the
                    government of China. Changing the name of the government on Taiwan has serious
                    consequences for the Kuomintang and its relationship with the people of Taiwan.
                    These are complicated Taiwan legitimacy issues that the USG cannot resolve. That
                    is why our official position since the 1972 communiqu� is a neutral one. The
                    issue is for Beijing and Taipei to work out peacefully. The issues are delicate
                    and so interwoven that cutting one innocent thread may lead to powerful
                    unintended consequences.</p>
                <p>Q: You were saying that one of DOD's main responsibilities was arms sales to
                    Taiwan. The 1982 Communiqu� talked about a steady decline in the amount of arms
                    sold. How were Taiwan's legitimate defense needs handled?</p>
                <p>REUTHER: Shortly after I assumed the Taiwan portfolio we began the annual arms
                    sales process and a review of Taiwan's defense needs. This starts with a visit
                    to Washington by a Taiwan delegation from the Ministry of Defense that presents
                    Taiwan's list of the equipment it wants and justifications. We call this the
                    pre-Arms Sales Talks. Taiwan's list is often eclectic. The list often included a
                    wide variety of equipment from submarines to communications equipment to request
                    for technology transfer for co-production purposes. My recollection is that this
                    list comes to us toward the end of the year, November/December, and then we hold
                    the Arms Sales Talks themselves in March or April.</p>
                <p>Taiwan's list always reflects the unique political situation from which it
                    arises. RAND recently completed a study on the Taiwan procurement process and
                    that study notes that Taiwan's list is a combination of what Taiwan's military
                    professional think they need to accomplish specific defensive tasks in addition
                    to what the political leaders add to the list. The government wants to
                    communicate to the Taiwan public that it is doing its best to purchase the
                    latest equipment. The problem is that you end up with a list that can be both
                    practical and hype. We have a responsibility not to rubber-stamp it, but give
                    each item due consideration. We break the list into functions and turn it over
                    to our best military and intelligence people to look at the functional
                    components: air defense or anti- submarine warfare, etc.</p>

                <p>REUTHER: Diplomacy is part of the nation's defense and one should not be
                    unfamiliar with the thinking of the military side of the house. Personally, my
                    avocation is World War II history. My personal career has been intimately bound
                    with that of my colleagues in the uniform services. Thailand dealing with the
                    Air Force; insurgency issues including my exposure to Foreign Service colleagues
                    who saw service in a CORDS assignment in Vietnam. Iraq issues certainly had a
                    military component. Some FSI training involved a class at an Air Force
                    installation in Florida. When we were evacuated from Sudan, I had a temporary
                    assignment in the Political Military Bureau that exposed me to my uniformed
                    colleagues. Finally, at DOD each issue we handled whether Korea, New Zealand or
                    Taiwan, we handled the military side. So, I was able to guide and contribute to
                    the ongoing discussion.</p>

                <p>REUTHER: I hope not, in the sense that the national interest is best protected by
                    good diplomacy, strong military and sophisticated intelligence. Each of which
                    works best when each practitioner understands the needs and limitations of the
                    other field.</p>

                        witTaiwan. Lot of paperwork?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: There was a considerable amount of information to digest between the
                    Pre- Talks and the Talks. Primarily we wanted to make certain we understood
                    where Taiwan was in its execution of some function and what might be the next
                    best step to improve its performance. When you introduce whole new systems, it
                    is important to determine whether the training, tactics and budgeting are in
                    place. Buying the latest fad is a waste of money if one cannot integrate the
                    system into current procedures. Also, by the time I was involved, a number of
                    political changes in Taiwan had significantly impacted on Taiwan's procurement
                    process. Under the unchallenged Kuomintang era Taiwan's defense budget and
                    requests were sometimes more extensive than we could approve. With the impact of
                    a more democratic system, the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) opposition was
                    generally anti-defense budget and by 1995 had made significant strides in both
                    cutting the budget and making the Ministry of Defense more accountable. As a
                    result, American defense companies would often contact us and complain that the
                    Defense Department was holding down Taiwan's spending and they were losing
                    contracts! In fact a much more sophisticated game was afoot. Democracy was
                    coming to Taiwan.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>The American defense contractors had never experienced democracy in Taiwan and
                    they were unprepared for its consequences. This is not an unusual phenomenon.
                    Twenty years earlier, as the American were winding down in Vietnam and the
                    Congress was cutting the defense budget, we often were involved with the Thai
                    Government to negotiate one politico-military issue or another. One incident I
                    specifically remember was that we wanted to shift reconnaissance aircraft from
                    an upcountry airfield to a southern airport. The distance was a couple hundred
                    kilometers, but the saving on gas and maintenance was noticeable. Thai
                    authorities had never been asked to approve an American proposal on the basis of
                    financial savings. After all the money we had spent in Vietnam, we were asking
                    to save the cost of a couple hundred kilometers! The Thai were dumbfounded and
                    believed for a period that we had some ulterior motive. I suspect that the
                    arrival of a more open system on Taiwan was equally bewildering to the defense
                    contractors used to Taiwan's steady, no-nonsense, military purchases.</p>

                <p>REUTHER: 1995 was the high mark of amiable cross-straits relations. Taipei and
                    Beijing were conducting serious and highly educational talks through their
                    mutual unofficial mechanisms labeled the Straits Exchange Foundation (SEF) on
                    the Taiwan side and the Association for Relations Across The Taiwan Straits
                    (ARATS) on Beijing side. It should be noted that the used of 'unofficial'
                    offices to conduct real exchanges was inaugurated by the Japanese in 1972 when
                    they established an unofficial office in Taiwan and copied by the U.S. in 1979
                    with the American Institute in Taiwan. Here was Taipei and Beijing copying the
                    Japanese and American precedent! There had been an earlier summit between SEF
                    and ARATS and one was tentatively scheduled for late summer 1995. A second
                    successful summit was predicted to open further the budding economic and social
                    relationship between Taiwan and the Mainland. It was not to be, however.
                    Appointed President of Taiwan Lee Teng-hui was about to seek election as the
                    Kuomintang candidate in the first popular election for President on Taiwan. A
                    marvelous milestone in the democratization of Taiwan. Unfortunately, to
                    demonstrate his talents in foreign policy for the electorate, he decided to he
                    wanted to travel to the United States. Actually there had been informal musings
                    about allowing short visits to set a precedent and move from there. With an
                    election deadline, however, Lee couldn't wait. With a campaign chest of $4.5
                    million the Kuomintang hired a lobby firm to exert pressure on the Executive
                    from the Congress to give Lee his trip, the venue was a speech at his alma
                    mater, Cornell University. The Kuomintang move coincided with the swearing in of
                    the highly partisan 104th Congress under Speaker Gingrich. Support for Lee's
                    travel to Cornell mushroomed and caught many unawares. In the Executive Branch
                    there were many who were blocked from trying to head-off this train wreck
                    because they could not conceive that Congress could be so irresponsible. In
                    these circles there was no doubt Lee's trip to Cornell, especially under
                    circumstances of obvious Kuomintang lobbying, was a worse case scenario. But,
                    Lee got his trip. The second SEF-ARATS summit was never held. The State
                    Department shunned the TECRO representative. And, consensus withered for moving
                    ahead on the provision of some of the systems the March 1995 Arms Sales Talks
                    had favored.</p>
                <p>The lesson here is that we can have pretty much any relationship we want with
                    Taiwan, as long as it is low profile. Little has changed since the Carter
                    Administration when we sold arms to Taiwan in batches less than had to be
                    reported to Congress. In ending Carter's policy and publicly announcing a major
                    arms sale to Taiwan, the Reagan Administration poked Beijing in the eye,
                    guaranteed a reaction, and ended up with the 1982 Communiqu�. The issue is not
                    that we need Beijing's permission or are kowtowing to Beijing in our
                    relationship with Taipei. The issue is that the lower profile a relationship we
                    have with Taipei in certain areas, the more fulsome it can be. Until the two of
                    them work out some mutual agreement. Anyway, Lee's trip to Cornell was a
                    watershed in which we were left with deteriorating relationships on both sides
                    of the Strait.</p>

                <p>REUTHER: Perhaps so, but one is always learning. It is always interesting to see
                    how some of the events that one has been involved with are represented in the
                    press or the academic community. For example, I have read academic tomes on
                    Sino-American relations that note that we refused to sell Taiwan the manpack
                    Stinger missile and forced them to purchase a jeep mounted version. And there is
                    a half-truth to this story. After Afghanistan and Stingers showing up in
                    unexpected places, the uniformed side of the house disapproved of providing the
                    manpack version of this weapon to anyone. I found this out when New Zealand
                    sought to purchase this equipment for one of its UN peacekeeping forces. We did
                    not sell manpack. The stingers had to be attached to something larger - so they
                    would not show up in unexpected places. That we consummated a Stinger sale for
                    Taiwan is a demonstration of doing our proper job, not abandoning the Taiwanese
                    as critics charged. Anyway you are right. I transferred out of ISA/AP in October
                    1995. It was an enormous pleasure to work with my uniformed colleagues from
                    Thailand to the Pentagon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do after the Pentagon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REUTHER: By then my retirement date was set for late September 1996. In fact,
                    everyone from the Deputy Assistant Secretary of Defense for Asia-Pacific to the
                    Undersecretary of Defense for Policy lobbied to keep me in the Pentagon for
                    those last few months. State, however, was intent on removing these billets from
                    ISA, the Pentagon's mini-State Department, and placing them in the military
                    commands. Whatever the reasoning of State's Under Secretary for
                    Politico-Military Affairs, I did not consider this move in the best interests of
                    the Foreign Service writ large. I see enormous benefits from the
                    cross-fertilization at an early stage in an officer's career. Those assigned to
                    military commands usually were very senior officers who had few years to use
                    whatthey learned.</p>
                <p>Anyway, short-term tours were hard to find and generally uninteresting. I was
                    lucky enough to be assigned to the office that handled Freedom of Information
                    Act (FOIA) requests. I had already begun to take courses at The George
                    Washington University and this assignment whetted my research interests.</p>

                <p>REUTHER: It strikes me that diplomacy is about being knowledgeable about a
                    foreign environment so that, as Americans, we call explain America's views to
                    others. This process builds friendships for the future. Friends are cultivated
                    not conjured. It strikes me that one of America's great contributions to world
                    economy is the salesman—the link between the consumer and the factory. The
                    salesman understands that the consumer wants blue widgets and convinces the
                    factory to paint the widgets blue. Without the salesman, the factory would be
                    less knowledgeable about consumer interests. The diplomat performs a similar
                    function; linking the American people with the rest of the world. Conversely
                    ignoring the salesman weakens business. Now this analogy can't be carried too
                    far. The salesman doesn't 'understand' his customer in the same way a diplomat
                    steeps himself in another culture to ensure that America's message is clear and
                    that foreign feedback is properly interpreted. But, viewing another culture
                    condescendingly is a good guarantee of building enmity toward the United States.
                    I am pleased to have worked with a talented and dedicated group of American
                    Foreign Service officers. It was a rewarding and expanding experience.</p>
