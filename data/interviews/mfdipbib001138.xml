                <p>Interviewed by: Joan Bartlett</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 7, 1992</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interview with Anne Stone on April 7, 1992 in
                        Dedham, Massachusetts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Could we begin by talking about why you decided to live in Massachusetts after
                    retiring from the Foreign Service?</p>
                <p>STONE: Well, we're both from the Boston area, born and brought up here. So when
                    the time came to leave the Foreign Service, we decided that we would settle here
                    where our roots were for the sake of our children, as much as anything else,
                    because they live near here too. And my mother and father-in-law were here, and
                    we wanted to be near them as they grew older.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: In Hingham, Massachusetts, near Boston.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you went to school in this area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: In this area and down south, and then back to Boston again. So both of us
                    were from right around here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how did you meet?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>STONE: We met in 1946, just before we went into the Foreign Service together, and
                    it was a rather rapid romance. Fortunately everything has worked out very well.
                    We joined the Foreign Service about three months after we were married, and went
                    down to Washington and started there. I can still remember — the men went off to
                    the State Department and we ladies were told that we had to come in to a class
                    to be sort of oriented. There was an older wife of a retired ambassador who gave
                    us classes, and told us we should wear our gloves and hats when we did our
                    calls, and we should have masses of calling cards. And she told us which corners
                    to turn down. I never remembered which corners they were. I think I have still
                    about three-quarters of the cards that I ordered and only used that technique
                    maybe once or twice at the very beginning. It was funny. And then we took
                    language courses with the men, which was very helpful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it really was a joint decision to join the Foreign
                        Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: Galen had already decided. He had passed his written exam, but hadn't
                    taken his oral. So we waited and waited and finally we wanted to get married, so
                    we did and went on our honeymoon in Bermuda. Lo and behold, after less than a
                    week, the call came to go to Washington. So that cut our honeymoon short. Then
                    we set off and went down to Washington for his initial training in September of
                    '47, and were assigned to our first post, which was Munich, in January of that
                    year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right after the war you went to Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: Right, very soon after the war — two years after — and headed right off on
                    the S.S. Rotterdam, which was a very small ship. I was three months pregnant,
                    and we bounced through a gale which was perfectly miserable, and landed in
                    Rotterdam. I was horrified! That was my first view of the destruction caused by
                    World War II. We drove down through the Ruhr Valley which had been so heavily
                    bombed. All the cities were devastated. I remember Cologne with only the
                    cathedral standing in the middle, and I wondered where on earth all the people
                    were living who seemed to have appeared from out of the ground. I think they
                    were living in the cellars. Comparatively speaking, Munich when we arrived there
                    seemed better because it was only 50% destroyed. All of our landmarks became a
                    half of a building here, a quarter of a building there, and an empty lot over
                    there. Every building was painted a terrible khaki green camouflage color. We
                    spent two years there with the American Consulate General, and it was a very
                    close group of people working together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you had your baby there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>STONE: I had my first baby there, in the 90th General Hospital, which was an Army
                    hospital. And I was in a ward for ten, and had these lovely nuns taking care of
                    me, all in German.</p>
                <p>It was often a sad post for me because the more German I learned, the more I
                    understood the suffering of the people as a result of the war, regardless of
                    whose fault the whole thing was. It wasn't fun. We had everything, and they had
                    next to nothing. They had no medications, and you were sometimes put in a
                    terrible position of having somebody come to you and say, “My baby is
                    desperately ill, and I can't get medicine unless I have coffee and cigarettes.”
                    So I wasn't sorry to leave. I also lost my father while we were there, and I was
                    young and that was very hard for me.</p>
                <p>So anyway, we went on from there to Kiel, in northern Germany first, where Galen
                    was the Deputy Land Observer for Schlesing Halstein. We really liked that a lot
                    better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: Well, I felt more comfortable with the north Germans than I did with the
                    Bavarians, probably because north Germany was British zone of occupation. South
                    Germany was American zone of occupation, and I think they were more antagonistic
                    toward the Americans on the whole. We were not supposed to even fraternize with
                    them. We did though; we made very wonderful life-long friends — a German family
                    that we see all the time. Their children have come to us, and their
                    grandchildren have visited us, so its been a wonderful relationship. In Kiel,
                    though we were only there about six months, we managed to have another baby. The
                    British really were colonialists in that area. They had control of the best
                    yacht club and all the sailboats. They had horses. They asked my husband if he'd
                    like to be “mounted,” and soon they brought him a horse. It was quite a dream
                    world. Our baby was born in the Kiel University Clinic, and she was the first
                    American baby to be born there. It was only half a building, the other half had
                    been bombed. Kiel was flat because of the fact that it was where the German
                    submarine pens were, and every single day at 3:00 in the afternoon they set off
                    another explosion slowly blowing that place up to remind the Germans of their
                    sins, I guess, which was kind of depressing.</p>
                <p>From there we went back to Washington, and had four years in Washington, while
                    Galen worked in the Bureau of German Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about that? Did you find it a bit
                        disappointing to come back to Washington since you'd joined the Foreign
                        Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: No, I expected it I think. It was a very, very busy time for me because we
                    had a third child. Well, it was just different, that's all. It wasn't as much
                    fun in many ways as being abroad, but I felt it was a good thing for me to live
                    in the United States too, to get back into the way of life, and get the American
                    perspective again.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you, in your Washington assignments, tend to live in
                        one area of Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: No. The first time we lived in northern Virginia, and after that we moved
                    into the District. After four years we were sent abroad again, and this time it
                    was to France, and Galen was to be the ... I've forgotten the exact technical
                    term, but what it amounted to was the Deputy Special Assistant to SACEUR for
                    International Affairs at “SHAPE” (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powersin Europe).
                    The first Supreme Commander was General Grunther, and the second was General
                    Norstadt, both Americans. We lived outside Paris, up on a plateau, in a place
                    called La Celle St. Cloud, and we lived a wonderfully French life. It was
                    exceptionally interesting for me. I already had had a lot of French, and I got a
                    lot more, believe me, because our two oldest children went to French school, and
                    one of them at six had to learn how to read and write in a language she didn't
                    understand, so I was her tutor; she gave me the accent, and I helped her with
                    learning how to read and everything. We learned French history together from the
                    perspective of a French child. It was a wonderful experience for me.</p>
                <p>My younger one was in nursery school, and of course, they were both bilingual
                    within six months — completely bilingual.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they keep their French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: They kept their French, especially the oldest one because she didn't leave
                    until she was ten. The little one lost more of it, she falls into the “tu” form
                    very easily. That was a wonderful four years because we were with a truly
                    international group. Our life was separated from the embassy, so up until that
                    time I really had not had a traditional diplomatic post. We had lots of friends
                    from all over the world as a result of this experience with SHAPE. We made
                    life-long friends there, and Galen liked his work very much. It was a great time
                    to be in Paris; I went to the Sorbonne and studied French with private teachers,
                    so it helped a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have an au pair for the children?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: Yes, we did. We had German au pairs because we had contacts in Germany who
                    would help us find nice girls, and they would come and enjoy living in Paris.
                    Our house was kind of a Tower of Babel — everybody speaking different languages
                    and mixing them a lot. Then we had a fourth child born in the American hospital
                    in Paris on Napoleon's birthday. We stayed on until 1958, and then we were sent
                    back to Washington again, and this time it was really hectic for us. Galen
                    worked long, long hours in the State Department, and even with an au pair I was
                    constantly busy because we had one more final child — that was the fifth,
                    another boy.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the age of the oldest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: When he was born the oldest was eleven, and the rest were nine, five, four
                    and the new little boy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wonderful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: Yes, it was wonderful, and it turned out to be...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Exhausting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: ...exhausting, but it turned out to be a wonderful thing for all of us to
                    have this big family when we traveled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were a team.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: That's right. I have very vivid memories of washing dishes, rinsing
                    diapers, and then going off to some of the most glamorous dinners you could
                    imagine, because Galen's last job was Deputy Director of the Bureau of European
                    Affairs. We were dealing with the French, the Belgians, the Dutch, and in
                    Washington then it was extremely elegant — long dresses in the evening. But
                    fortunately you could sort of change gears and go on. It was great fun. The
                    children were very active and kept me extremely busy, but I also had to
                    entertain for Galen's job about every two weeks; put on a formal dinner. We
                    somehow managed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You don't look like you minded it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: No, I enjoyed it. I enjoyed the challenge of it.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>That takes us to 1963, and just after Kennedy's assassination we were transferred
                    to London. Galen was assigned to the Imperial Defense College as the Foreign
                    Service representative for that year, which was a wonderful opportunity for us.
                    So we found a house in the country in Ascot, and he commuted by train. He used
                    to ride his bicycle down with his brolly under his arm and take the train into
                    London. I used to go into London one day a week, and spend that time with the
                    people from the Imperial Defense College and their wives. We made life-long
                    friends again from all over the British Commonwealth. Meanwhile we put the three
                    children whom we brought with us in British schools. Because they were
                    transferring us, January to January (which is unbelievable when you have five
                    children), we had to leave the two older girls behind in boarding school. We
                    couldn't uproot them twice in the middle of the year. They were fifteen and
                    thirteen, and we just couldn't do that. So they stayed home and that was
                    horrible. I didn't like that one bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean they stayed in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: One of them stayed in Washington, and the other went to boarding school.
                    Luckily, I have a mother-in-law and a father-in-law who were absolutely
                    wonderful surrogate parents for us. They were young enough to be able to enjoy
                    them, and to go and see them, and take care of them, supervise them, or we never
                    would have done it. We just would have dragged them with us. In this case they
                    had continuity — the oldest one had the last three years in boarding school. And
                    the next one had more than that, she had four years away from us. Somehow they
                    survived all right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was harder for you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: It was very ... it was hard for all of us. They were lonely too. The three
                    younger ones came with us. Two of them had a good experience in British schools,
                    and the middle boy — the eight year old — had a horrible experience because the
                    head master was anti-American in this little British school. Young Galen didn't
                    understand this until he was much older, but he remembers the antagonism, and
                    being singled out in front of the whole school as an American in a derogatory
                    way. That was very hard for him, because he is a very sensitive person. But that
                    was for only a year, and everybody survived.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Luckily, while we were there, our closest friends at the Imperial Defense College
                    were Indians, and lo and behold we were transferred to New Delhi directly from
                    England. I think this was a big advantage in those days because Americans, when
                    you say, “Oh, I'm to go live in India,” shudder and think of the poverty.
                    Whereas the British all had happy connections with it from their parents and
                    grandparents, or whatever, and they'd say, “How lucky you are. I've always
                    wanted to go to India.” So we went with very positive feelings about it, and
                    these Indian friends saved us a lot of pitfalls, I'll tell you. They really told
                    us how to live our lives there, and helped us get settled in very quickly. We
                    went there in the spring of 1965 for our first posting in Delhi. Galen was in
                    charge of Political External Affairs — political affairs but the external aspect
                    of it, meaning India's relationship with the rest of the world, under Ambassador
                    Chester Bowles. We stayed three years the first time, and everybody in the
                    family really loved India. From my perspective, I guess, the best thing about it
                    was the fact that I felt I could use some of my own skills, and be of some help
                    to the people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were a nurse?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: I was originally, well, back in the dark ages. I was a pediatric nurse.
                    The minute I got to India this first time, I started working with a doctor on
                    family planning. We went around in a mobile van and tried to help the women
                    receive some form of birth control. It was really a fascinating way to get to
                    know the Indian people because we'd go to factories, and the wives of the
                    workers would come into the van and be treated. Then we'd go to a village, and
                    you'd learn the social structure of that village and who you had to reach before
                    you were going to convince the others that they needed to use birth control, and
                    have small families. I had a very interesting woman, doctor, with whom I worked
                    and she told me a lot. Then along came a war with Pakistan and she and I taught
                    first aid together all over Delhi. So that was interesting too.</p>
                <p>And then a little later on I worked in the Holy Family Hospital, which was our
                    best hospital there. I worked with the newborns, and learned that Indian babies
                    generally weigh a maximum of five pounds, compared to our big whoppers. It was,
                    again, a very nice way of getting to know the Indian people; more closely on a
                    totally different level. And then our older children all did volunteer work when
                    they were there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had then three children there with you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: Three there all the time, and the other two were in boarding school and
                    came for vacations.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>To go back to our arrival in Delhi, if I may on direct transfer from England.
                    This Indian friend was simply indispensable to me, because I arrived with the
                    children and we first stayed in an apartment up on the fifth floor overlooking
                    the back part of a Delhi market place. There were three men in white uniforms in
                    our kitchen who were obviously put there by someone from the embassy to help us.
                    And if I hadn't had my friend to tell me what to be on guard against, and how to
                    handle these people, I would really have been stumbling around in the dark. For
                    one thing, you really couldn't put them in the position where they had the
                    temptation of stealing from you, because they would do it all the time, like in
                    many other posts in that part of the world. You were really doing them a
                    disfavor if you weren't clued in.</p>
                <p>The other thing was, she warned me very much — when I moved into my house
                    especially — not to neglect having an ayah — a nurse. She said, “It's for Pam,
                    it's for your daughter more than it is for the little five year old boy, because
                    they're all male servants.” And she told me horror stories of how children had
                    been intimidated by the servants, and hadn't told their parents what was going
                    on. So I took her advice, and it was very wise, I think, to have that woman in
                    the house always. When we moved into our house, there was a servants' quarters
                    in the back that often times seemed to have 30 people living in it, and we
                    weren't sure who all these “cousin brothers,” and “cousin sisters” were, but we
                    finally made it a rule, for health reasons, that we had to know who was living
                    back there. And they usually told us. Not only that, but we hired a doctor to
                    take care of them because our health was dependent on their health, and we
                    wanted them to be healthy anyway — watch out for tuberculosis and the many other
                    diseases they were prone to.</p>
                <p>We were living in a nice little bungalow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you sought out your own housing. It wasn't
                        provided?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: No, they told us what was available because the house went with the job,
                    and it turned out to be very nice, and had a lovely garden all around it which
                    we took great interest in. In that house I picked out my own cook, and bearer —
                    a bearer is a butler. We had one cook, two bearers — the head and the second;
                    and two sweepers. The bearer would only do things above the knees, and the
                    sweepers would only do things below the knees — that's what the old saying was.
                    And you could not get them to use a vacuum cleaner or anything like that. They
                    went around on their hands and knees and squatted down and brushed with a little
                    old brush made of sticks and twigs. Then we had at least one “mali”, who was the
                    gardener. We had a washer man who was called a “dhobie” We had lots of people
                    who wandered in and out. And then the ayah, who was very much a part of the
                    family, so it was quite a responsibility to be in charge of them all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there someone between you and all these people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>STONE: The head bearer, whose name was Mohammed. We dearly loved Mohammed. He was
                    actually the major domo, but I dealt directly with most of them, the cook
                    especially who was a rather terrifying guy. He was from Bengal, and he descended
                    from a clan known as the “Mugs” who had been pirates in the old days. The
                    British somehow discovered they were good cooks, and so they tamed them, I
                    guess. You could just have imagined him with a knife in his teeth. He had quite
                    a temper. He used to throw things sometimes, but I'd go out there every day and
                    plan the menus with him for dinner parties. He was an artist. I remember one
                    time we were having a dinner party, and the dessert came on and he surprised me
                    with it. It was a violin made with strings of spun sugar that he'd made out of —
                    I've forgotten what — cake and a kind of shiny brown frosting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you having a musical evening?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: No, it was his idea. And I also learned that I had to dole things out,
                    which really makes you feel funny. But I had to keep things under lock and key
                    in a “godown,” so called, a storage room. You'd go and unlock it and dole out
                    what you needed for the day, and then lock it back up. And that way they weren't
                    tempted to take things home all the time, although I'm sure they got their share
                    all the same.</p>
                <p>It was a wonderful experience living in India. I think all of us grew, and
                    learned more in the time we spent there than anywhere else in the world. It was
                    a wonderful experience, and we made lots of friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the morale at the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: At that time the morale was very good, very close, an exceptional group of
                    people. It was huge. We had an AID mission that was immense, and even USIS was
                    very large. I think we figured, the second time we went back which wasn't long
                    after that — it was in '69 — there were 3,000 Americans in the Delhi area,
                    counting some business people, all of whom were under the umbrella of the
                    embassy as far as morale and sort of general taking care of was concerned. The
                    embassy itself was very large, with many dependents, so that we had an American
                    international school there. I really can't give the number of students, but it
                    was a large school with excellent teaching. Our third daughter graduated from
                    there, and went right on to a good college. As a matter of fact, she was a
                    National Merit Scholar runner up. They had a lot of very good students in the
                    school.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>There were just so many wonderful things about living in Delhi that you'd never
                    find anywhere else in the world; experiencing their holidays, for example. We
                    had a lot of Indian friends and they would take us with them for their big
                    parades, and the big celebrations of all sorts — festivals of spring, festivals
                    of fall, weddings. We got to take part in all those different things. I can
                    remember one wedding right next door to us — next door was what they call a
                    “joint family.” A joint family would consist of mother and father, and their
                    sons with wives — as many as could live there. The father was the boss of all of
                    the financial things in the family. He was the general boss of the family, but
                    the mother-in-law ran everything else, and she ran her daughters-in-law to the
                    extent that she'd even tell them what sari to wear, and when they could see
                    their husbands, and when they could have a baby, and all the rest. One of our
                    neighbor's daughters got married, so we were there watching. It was at 3:00 a.m.
                    that the ceremony took place.</p>
                <p>A pundit, or holy man, would decide after looking at their astrological patterns,
                    or whatever you call it, that this was the auspicious moment for them to be
                    married. So whether it was the middle of the night, or in the middle of the day
                    it didn't matter. The ceremony went on and on and on. Galen, my husband, often
                    said that the reasons they had so few divorces and remarriages in India was
                    because it took so long to get married, you couldn't go through it twice. This
                    wedding [was] right on the other side of our fence, so we were there, of course,
                    watching them arrive, the groom arriving on a white horse with a golden veil
                    over his face. And then he and his bride saw each other for the first time as
                    they sat on a pedestal and raised their veils. They had a special kind of a
                    platform in the middle of the garden, with the holy man on it, in front the
                    sacred fire, and later the bride and the groom joined him. The next thing I
                    knew, there was our little 6 year old son up on the platform with them. I think
                    they invited him up there, and he was watching everything — this blond,
                    blue-eyed child, having a lovely time. They are very kind to children, wonderful
                    with children. So that was a very exciting period in our lives, and we stayed
                    there three years that time with Chester Bowles. And then, lo and behold, they
                    said that Galen was posted to Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you and your family take this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: That wasn't fun, at all. I was very angry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had no choice in the matter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: If you knew Galen, you'd know that he wouldn't...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Duty calls.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>STONE: Yes. He felt that so many of his friends had had to do this, that it was
                    his turn. And he would not refuse, that was it, period! I knew his mind was made
                    up, but I was angry. I really felt that, with five children, it was a lot to ask
                    to have him go out there at that time when it was extremely dangerous. It was
                    the time of “Tet,” and that was a very bad period in Vietnam. But, being a
                    dutiful Foreign Service wife, I bit my lip and went on. We decided right away
                    that it wouldn't be wise for me to stay in some place like Thailand or the
                    Philippines, they were the two choices, but that I should come back here with
                    the children. So I rented a house here in Dedham for a year, and people were
                    very kind to me. They didn't quite know what to do with the situation I was in,
                    because most of them didn't approve of the war, but they were very good to us,
                    really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He went out there for a year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: It was 15 months, and it was a long 15 months, too, with an adolescent
                    boy, and three girls in adolescence, and a son of eight. It was a difficult
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you bring any help home with you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: No. We just lived like everybody else. And that was no problem. I went to
                    visit Galen after he'd been out there about eight months, I guess. They let me
                    come at Easter of 1969.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right to Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: Right to Vietnam, and it was very exciting. There's an unusual story about
                    that because my visit happened to coincide with a visit of a new Assistant
                    Secretary of State, whose wife accompanied him to Vietnam. So I got in on all of
                    the things that were done for her. The first thing we did was take a helicopter
                    ride over all of Saigon and the area around Saigon in an Army helicopter, where
                    you just had a seat strap, and they had the doors open on either side so when
                    they banked you were kind of leaning over space. And in the back was a soldier
                    with a machine gun, and in the front was a soldier with a machine gun. And then
                    the next thing I remember doing with her seemed incongruous. We were taken down
                    to the docks on the Saigon River, and we got onto an Army launch, which was a
                    good sized boat. We were on the upper deck with a huge American flag sticking
                    out of the back, and there was a sort of awning over the top of it. We cruised
                    the Saigon River, and had a tea party on the top deck. There were two young
                    girls, and Mrs. Abrams, and the wife of the Assistant Secretary of State, and
                    myself.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>It was wonderful. On the bank on the opposite side from Saigon, was just jungle,
                    really. I mean it was wild. And that's where all those rockets were coming from
                    every night when they aimed them and just shot them willy-nilly at Saigon. I
                    never will forget; we passed a small Navy patrol vessel coming back from their
                    patrol, and their eyes almost fell out of their heads when they saw this going
                    on. Our only protection was a boat about the size of a bathtub, with two Saigon
                    policemen with a machine gun in it between us and the Viet Cong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long did you stay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: I stayed two weeks, and you felt like you were living in a Hemingway
                    novel, or something. It was very romantic, and very traumatic. Every night the
                    rockets would come in. It sounded like the Fourth of July.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your husband, except for being apart from you, did he
                        enjoy this assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: Well, Galen is the kind of person who'll throw himself into anything. I
                    think he enjoyed it, except it was seven days a week, and at least 14 hours a
                    day. It was pretty exhausting, but I think what he really liked was going up in
                    helicopters, and going out to the battlefields with some of the generals so he
                    could see what was going on. He was the head of the Political Section, so he had
                    to keep track of what was happening. He loved that. That was exciting, but I
                    didn't like his doing it much. Luckily I didn't know about it beforehand, he'd
                    tell me about it after. The worst thing that ever happened to me was, one time
                    when I was back in Dedham, the telephone rang, and it was from Washington. This
                    young man — I think he was young, he certainly was immature — said, “Is this
                    Mrs. Stone?” (Oh, I know, Galen was going to come home on vacation on leave with
                    us, and we were looking forward to that in about another week or two.) So this
                    voice came on and said, “Is this Mrs. Stone?” And I said, “Yes, it is.” And he
                    said, “Well, I'm afraid I've got bad news for you.” Can you imagine?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This call was from the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: Yes. And all he was going to tell me was that Galen was delayed a day or
                    so. Well, the children were right beside me, and they said I went totally white,
                    absolutely white. I mean, it was terrifying, a silly thing to do. But he came
                    home safely, and we went back to India again. To his surprise the new ambassador
                    requested him as a DCM because of his former experience there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that, going back to a post?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>STONE: Well, at first I didn't really want to do it. I thought it might be a
                    disappointment. But on the contrary, those last four years — four more years, so
                    we had seven years in India total — were just wonderful. It was a very different
                    job. Our Ambassador was Kenneth Keating, who had been a Senator in New York; he
                    was defeated by Robert Kennedy, so he was sent off by the President to be
                    Ambassador to India. He didn't know anything about India. He didn't have a wife,
                    he was a widower, so I had to be his hostess, and help him in whatever way I
                    could. And I also had to be the one who sort of was the mother hen for the
                    embassy wives. It was challenging because I was being Galen's hostess as well,
                    and it was a very busy place. We had a tremendous number of guests. You'd be
                    surprised how many people came from all over the world, and had to be taken care
                    of.</p>
                <p>One of the first things that happened to us was a CODEL, a group of Senators — I
                    think 10 or 15 of them, with wives, who arrived and stayed about ten days. We
                    had to plan their stay. Each one of us was assigned a wife, and I had Mrs.
                    Sparkman from Alabama. That was a very active period, but it was always busy. We
                    had fascinating people come to Delhi from all different walks of life. Keating
                    was an extremely hospitable man, I was very fond of him. He was there for three
                    years, but actually he had to go home quite a bit, so Galen was Charg� a good
                    bit of the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many of your children were there this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: Well, at that time we started out with only one, then we had two, and then
                    we had three, and the last year the older one came and stayed with us, all for
                    varying reasons. The youngest was with me alone for one year, and it was a
                    wonderful relationship. I didn't go to any receptions that year, I would stay
                    home. We read books that were too hard for him to read — I read them aloud to
                    him. It was a very wonderful time. And the next year he and his sister, Pam,
                    became extremely close living there alone together. Then after that more sisters
                    came. His older brother was away most of the time except during vacations. He
                    was at boarding school by then.</p>
                <p>We now look back on our reasons for sending our children to boarding school;
                    number one; we were fortunate enough to be able to afford it, but also, the main
                    thing was this wonderful backup we had of my mother and father-in-law who would
                    take care of them at home. We felt very strongly that the greatest gift we could
                    give our children was a really good education, and we didn't want them to doubt
                    for a minute that they were Americans. We wanted them to know what they were
                    because we'd seen a lot of children in the Foreign Service who were very
                    confused, and had a lot of trouble adjusting to college, at that time especially
                    — that was the '70s — because they didn't know what they were anymore. This is
                    why we made the decision to send them home. The boys thanked us for it, they
                    both appreciated it. The girls weren't so sure, and actually one of them, Pam,
                    didn't like boarding school at all and came right back after a year and
                    graduated from the American school. That worked out well for her. But sending
                    them home was hard. It was always a wrench, and I did resent it a lot having
                    them away.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you keep in touch?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: We wrote all the time, but also they came home for Christmas. The only
                    vacation they missed was Easter, because that was too short. We had them with us
                    all summer long, so they'd have four months out of the year with us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a long distance to be separated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: Yes, it was a long way. I remember one of them at 13 traveled from the
                    United States to India by himself, but he didn't have any problems.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do your children look back on the whole thing? Are
                        they pleased that they had this sort of up-bringing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: I think they're realistic about it. I think some of it they found was just
                    wonderful. Other parts, no, they didn't like so much. The separations they
                    definitely didn't like. And if I had it to do again, I wouldn't send the girls
                    away at all. I would have kept them. Not strictly because they're girls, but
                    just because of the natures of those three children. I think they would have
                    been better off at home regardless of the education because they were good
                    students, and I think they would have been all right. But you don't know that at
                    the time, and perhaps they wouldn't have done so well because you know what the
                    '70s were like, and the '60s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No matter what you do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: Yes. They might have had a terrible time in college. So I really don't
                    know. In Delhi our children were exposed to a lot of drugs, and some children
                    there ran amuck and had to be sent home — the whole families had to be sent
                    home. On every street corner they were selling marijuana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very hard, isn't it? Very hard to keep track of
                        everybody.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: My littlest one told me that he'd been offered drugs from the time he was
                    about 9 or 10 years old from the woman who sold cigarettes sitting outside the
                    school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you did manage to avoid it in your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>STONE: Well, I'm sure they did what everybody else did in those days, but luckily
                    our kids didn't happen to get into it. [I] know that some of our friends'
                    children did. It really ruined their lives in some cases.</p>
                <p>Q: Were your children generally healthy? STONE: Yes, very healthy. Q: That makes
                    it a lot easier.</p>
                <p>STONE: I think we had another advantage. Not only did I have my mother and
                    father-in-law, who were such stable models for the children...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And had a good big house...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: Right, but they also have an extended family which is huge, and very
                    close. Because of this they didn't feel that they were just living for
                    themselves, or maybe for Mom and Dad, but they were responsible to all those
                    other people. Rather like the village relationship that you get in India, or
                    other countries.</p>
                <p>Then there was an awful moment in '73 when we had a direct transfer to Paris. It
                    was the first time I'd been without children, and it was very lonely. We went in
                    April and there was no sun, people never said hello to you, nobody seemed to be
                    smiling. Again, I was in the same position where our ambassador, Jack Irwin, was
                    a widower. Galen was his DCM, so once again I had to be hostess for two men. I
                    would have done anything in the world for Ambassador Irwin though. He was one of
                    the nicest men — he is one of the nicest men I know. I had to go to all of his
                    major dinner parties, and make sure everything was all right with the social
                    secretary, and have on my right the number one guest, and so on. But again, we
                    met the most fascinating people in Paris. Everybody passes through, and the
                    French themselves, of course, were stimulating. All of our children were away in
                    school, but they came back a lot because it was so close, and spent, for
                    instance, their winter term there, or whatever, doing a special project.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the late '70s?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: This was '73 to '75. We stayed there two years and that was longer than
                    any DCM had stayed in Paris for many, many years. It was a very hard job, and I
                    was quite miserable at the beginning. I felt very lonely for Delhi, and my
                    friends, and the warmth there. Not just the temperature, but the people. Paris
                    seemed to me very cold, and a superficial place with the values all confused. It
                    took me about three months to get used to it. And then I made up my mind, well,
                    this is silly, just get down to it and find something that interests you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where do you think you found that strength?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>STONE: I have no idea. I think it's realism. It's just being realistic about it.
                    What I did was take on the job of being president of the Junior Guild of the
                    American Cathedral which involved a lot of the kind of things that I felt
                    worthwhile. We did quite a bit of social work through that. So that was what
                    really brought me through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get back to your nursing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: No, no I couldn't. I'd never had a chance to do that after our first post
                    in Delhi. Just too busy. And you know, it wasn't encouraged really.</p>
                <p>Oh, I meant to put in one thing about the feminist side of the Foreign Service.
                    When we had been in Delhi for the last four years, our tour was almost over, and
                    Daniel Patrick Moynihan was assigned as Ambassador, and Galen overlapped with
                    him for about two months in order to help him get established. We were already
                    assigned to Paris, and we knew we were going, but he wanted to ease his entrance
                    into Delhi. Ambassador Moynihan's wife came with him, and what surprised us was
                    that she announced right from the beginning that she had not been consulted on
                    this, that she really didn't want to come to India. When we all greeted her —
                    all the women were being very warm and courteous — and we told her that we had
                    ... I think it was called the American Women's Club, but somehow the word
                    American wives came into this thing, and she said, “Don't tell me you use the
                    term American wives! How archaic you are out here!” So that was really a
                    surprise to me because ... I told her right there in front of everybody, “I am
                    very proud to be Galen's wife, and I'm very glad to support him in any way I
                    can. That's the way its been, and I think we have a service to give to our
                    country, and maybe we don't get paid for it but it's very gratifying all the
                    same. We get a lot of benefits too.” The funny thing was that after their time
                    there, she was the one who was totally hooked on India, and has been writing
                    books about it every since. She adores it, absolutely adores it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did she get into the wive's groups, and things like
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: I think she finally did, but we didn't stay long enough to see. And he
                    enjoyed it too, I think. They didn't stay terribly long, maybe not even two
                    years before he was sent back.</p>

                <p>STONE: That was the place where it started because there was so much asked of

                </p>
                <p>STONE: We knew that the Japanese wives were paid — ambassador's wives, or DCM's
                    wives, and so were the Swedes. One of the biggest insults I felt was that when
                    we transferred directly from Delhi, where we'd had all our clothes made by a
                    “dherzi”, who is a tailor who sits cross-legged in your living room or somewhere
                    and sews for you — obviously they were homemade clothes — and going to Paris, I
                    had to have new, appropriate clothes. We asked for a clothing allowance, and
                    they sent $150.00 for the whole family. I couldn't even buy a skirt for that,
                    because the exchange rate was terrible at that time. I almost sent it back to
                    them, considering that amount an insult. But then I came home and I just had to
                    go and buy American clothes with my own money, and take them back.</p>
                <p>Yes, I did begin to feel resentful. I thought it wasn't fair with all that we
                    gave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year, again, was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: '73, and '72 was the changeover, when Foreign Service wives couldn't be in
                    their husband's efficiency reports anymore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about that particular decision?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: It didn't really make any difference to me. I felt I'd do the same thing
                    that I was doing before, regardless of what they said about me. And I never paid
                    an awful lot of attention to what they said, anyway. Galen never emphasized it.
                    If it was a nice remark, that's fine. That didn't make so much difference, but I
                    did feel it was an imposition to expect so much of us without any compensation
                    whatsoever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think spouses should be paid as the Japanese
                        are?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: I think on the upper levels they definitely should be compensated in some
                    way, as long as they're in the post, and as long as they're doing what they are
                    supposed to be doing. Now who would make that judgment — I guess the inspector
                    would. But I felt if they were doing the job, that of an Ambassador's wife, it
                    is a full time job. And they should be compensated. Not, of course, to the
                    degree that their husbands are paid, but certainly adequately compensated,
                    taking into consideration all the perks that go with that job. We had cars and
                    drivers, and things like that. I hope they will do that some day.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STONE: Well, it has taken a long time, it's 20 years after other countries. Oh,
                    our saving grace in Paris was that that right near the beginning of our stay, we
                    were offered a house to rent right near the Forest of Fontainebleau, in a little
                    town called Reclouse, and it was one of the most charming village houses which
                    had been owned by an American. So we had that for about six months of the year
                    and every single weekend we would escape there, to walk, and relax, and be
                    normal human beings. That was just wonderful. It saved us because otherwise we
                    were going out to three receptions and a dinner every night in the week, except
                    Saturday and Sunday. Nobody entertained Saturday and Sunday.</p>

                <p>STONE: Yes, they went away, and if they didn't go away I think they hid in their
                    apartments. It was a very hectic life.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a totally different experience altogether?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: Before, we were really living with the French. We were a part of a little
                    community where our neighbors all knew us, and I went to the Marche. In Paris we
                    were in an embassy house — an embassy residence — with four servants and the
                    chef did all of the shopping in the lovely little march� there right in the
                    heart of Paris. It was just a totally different experience. The type of people
                    we were exposed to were of a completely different nature.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the embassy itself that time? How was the morale?
                        Were there a lot of wives who were staying home, or pursuing their own
                        careers?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>STONE: Not yet. That was just starting. The morale in Paris is never as good as
                    one would think, especially among the secretaries. They had more of a turnover
                    among the secretaries than in almost any other post, because they were lonely.
                    They'd come over with high expectations of having a glamorous life, and it was
                    not like that because the French don't ask you into their homes, and they rarely
                    included anybody who was a secretary. For the rest of us it was busy and
                    interesting. It was a great experience, but not my favorite post, that's all. I
                    found that it was...well, number one, too hectic. You just didn't have time to
                    assimilate what was happening to you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I think it's a hard time in life anyway when the last
                        of the children leave, and you're sort of grieving at that time. You feel it
                        more when you're overseas perhaps.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: When you arrive at a new post your husband goes off to his office, and
                    everything is structured for him. I told him this and he finally understood. We
                    moved right on to one post after another and each time he had the same
                    stationery, the same type of cables, even the in box-out box and the secretary
                    to sift everything, to make his telephone calls for him, to worry about the
                    foreign languages that had to be dealt with. And the wife just comes and is
                    dumped in this new place and must find her niche, find what she wants to do with
                    her life. If you don't speak the language, that takes a little while. Or even if
                    you do, I think the telephone is one of the most terrifying things, don't you,
                    in a foreign country? When you have to read the yellow pages, and all the rest.
                    I did speak French. It wasn't that I didn't speak French, but we were speaking
                    on a very advanced level in this last posting in Paris, and they wouldn't speak
                    English even if they spoke it fluently. Sometimes we'd come home at night and
                    feel like somebody had tied a tight band around our heads. By 12:00 at night,
                    after talking French all evening and trying to respond on political subjects, or
                    whatever, it was exhausting. So that was why it wasn't as much fun. But there
                    were nice things about it too, of course.</p>

                <p>STONE: Galen was supposed to be Ambassador to Laos. That was in '75, and we left
                    Paris with every intention of going to Laos together. One by one the southeast
                    countries fell to the communists, until finally by the fall of '75 they told us
                    that they weren't going to have an ambassador there at all. We'd been waiting in
                    the United States to find out what was going to happen. Yes, it would have been
                    a fascinating post. So we stayed on in Washington and Galen was the head of a
                    selection committee. He was then persuaded to go to Vienna, to be the Ambassador
                    to the International Atomic Energy Agency, and we stayed there for two years. As
                    far as the life in Vienna was concerned, it was wonderful. His job was not
                    exactly what he would have preferred. It involved multilateral negotiation.
                    There was an awful lot of political finagling going on all the time in the IAEA.
                    But our weekends were super. We became hikers, and one thing we did with South
                    African friends from the IAEA was to hike the whole of Austria from the German
                    border all the way up to the top where it joins Czechoslovakia, and then back
                    down to Yugoslavia. That was just fabulous. We loved Austria, it was a very nice
                    post, but not ideal for Galen from the point of view of work.</p>

                </p>
                <p>STONE: Well, how did I spend my days? I spent an awful lot of time walking
                    because we never used the car. I think I was the first, or one of the first,
                    Americans to serve on the board of a women's volunteer organization. The
                    Viennese women had never had a volunteer group before which served in hospitals,
                    and other institutions, so this was really a brand new experience for them, and
                    they needed the confidence that perhaps Americans could give them, having had
                    years and years of experience in volunteering. [I] got to know some very nice
                    Austrian women through that. And I studied German all the time again for the
                    second time, and that helped a lot. I used the Foreign Service course. We had a
                    lot of guests too, and I had to be the tour guide again.</p>

                <p>STONE: And their friends, and our nieces, and our nephews, and everybody else
                    kept coming back and forth. We had a lot of visitors there. Those two years went
                    very, very fast.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>And then we were assigned to Cyprus, and that again was a direct transfer.
                    Frankly, I didn't exactly know where Cyprus was in the Mediterranean. I mean I
                    had it a little too far to the west. I didn't realize it was right south of
                    Turkey. That was a most interesting post. We spent three years there. Galen was
                    ambassador. We lived on the Greek Cypriot side, which is the southern part of
                    the island. The island is only 120 miles long, and about 60 or 70 miles wide at
                    its widest point. It's quite small, and divided right down the middle,
                    lengthwise, by the “Green Line” with the UN troops. 1974 was the time that the
                    Turkish army invaded from the north and took over quite a bit of Cyprus for the
                    Turkish Cypriots, and then remained there. There were 30,000 Turkish troops in
                    the north while we were there. The distribution of land was totally out of
                    balance because the Turkish Cypriots had something like 33%, and only a very
                    small percentage of the population, while the Greek Cypriots were all down in
                    the south with far too little land for the number of people. That was something
                    they were always trying to negotiate.</p>
                <p>The embassy was right in Nicosia, which is the capital. And Nicosia too was
                    divided into Turkish Cypriot and Greek Cypriot. Our embassy was really a
                    temporary building because the first embassy was destroyed during the '74 war.
                    It was then in an office building with the embassy residence on the top of the
                    office building. Galen used to describe it as similar to being on a ship, where
                    you had your boiler room down below, and your salon and the cabins up above. It
                    took me a very long time ... the top floors were the entertaining floors, and
                    our bedroom floor was down one, and it took me such a long time not to go up to
                    bed. I can't tell you how many times I went up the stairs, and had to come down
                    again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then he worked down below?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: He worked down below. The building was so fortified that it was like
                    living in a reverse prison. It was fascinating, and not always very pleasant.
                    They had been attacked — Ambassador Davies was assassinated in his office in
                    '74. They had put high metal fences all around it; in some places very close to
                    the building, with barbed wire all around the top of that. Everything was
                    controlled automatically by the Marines who were downstairs.</p>
                <p>So if I wanted to go just out of the building into the space between the fence
                    and the building, they had to push a button; or enter it again, they again had
                    to push a button. And if I wanted to go out through that fence, they had to let
                    me go out. They had mirrors everywhere with closed circuit television. We had
                    Cypriot police bodyguards, and for the first year and a half I could never go
                    anywhere without a bodyguard. Galen, always for the whole three years had to
                    have bodyguards. But finally after a year and a half I said, “Look, this is
                    ridiculous. Only the wife of the President of Cyprus goes around with
                    bodyguards. Please can I use my judgment, and take one when I feel it's
                    necessary, and not when I go to buy tooth brushes, or something?” So they said,
                    “Okay.”</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>I must say I got very close to those bodyguards. They were wonderful. And I
                    learned so much about Cyprus, and life of the people from talking to them. They
                    were very kind people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You make the best of a lot of things. I picture you
                        walking over the hills of Austria, and then having to adjust to living
                        almost in a prison.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: That's true. I didn't like it when Galen would be going someplace that I
                    knew was rather risky, and his car would drive out and those great gates would
                    clang shut. I'd think, please look out for him, please let everything go all
                    right. Oh, I forgot to say that when we arrived in Cyprus it was at the time
                    that President Carter lifted the arms embargo on Turkey, which had been in place
                    ever since the Turkish invasion of northern Cyprus in '74. It had been in place
                    for four years, and of course, the Greek Cypriots were furious when this was
                    lifted. So we had demonstrations around the embassy for our first ten days. They
                    put barbed wire across all the access roads, and there were armored cars all
                    round the streets, and we'd hear the crowds yelling in the distance. One day I
                    was up in my bedroom, and in came a Marine, dressed in fatigues with hand
                    grenades, a gun, and helmet, into my bedroom. I said, “What do you want?” He
                    said, “This is a good vantage point.” He went over and he was opening up the
                    blinds to peek out, so then I got him to take me up on the roof. We went up on
                    the roof and peeked over the edge to see what was going on out on the streets
                    beyond, because you couldn't see anything otherwise — from up there you could
                    see the crowds and hear them. It was not a pleasant feeling.</p>

                    didn't think was necessary. Then Galen...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cyprus was your last posting, and then your husband
                        retired right from Cyprus, and you made the decision to come back and live
                        here to be close to family. Did that go smoothly, the retirement
                        process?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>STONE: Oh, yes. Well, for me it did. But just to finish up on Cyprus; after that
                    initial period when we had the demonstrations all the time, Galen made it a
                    point of visiting all of the heads of the different parties, and there were
                    quite a few factions in Cyprus, including the radical socialists who were very
                    anti-American. From that time on we really never felt threatened at all. It was
                    interesting. The Cypriot people are very warm, hospitable people once they get
                    to know you. Once a Greek Cypriot is a friend, he's a friend for life, and the
                    Turkish Cypriots too. We had a house up in the northern part, on the coast, and
                    we'd go there every weekend. The purpose of this was to be able to get to know
                    the Turkish Cypriots, although we couldn't recognize their government as an
                    independent government up there. Galen always had to address the president as
                    “His Excellency” not as Mr. President, because before the war he had been one of
                    the heads of the government when the government was united. But we never could
                    address them as Mr. Minister, or anything like that. Still we had wonderful
                    social contacts with them, and that was the reason for having the place in the
                    north. It also served as a great escape for us. No bodyguards, we could drive
                    our car ourselves!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't understand why there wouldn't have been such a
                        threat up there though.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>STONE: Because of the Turkish army, because we're allies of Turkey. They had
                    30,000 troops up there in a very small area, and there were no extremists that
                    would have been wanting to shoot the American ambassador, I guess. But in the
                    south we had the PLO and some anti-American extremists. There had been a lot of
                    incidents in Cyprus. Just before we arrived, an Egyptian was assassinated and
                    they'd held 20 people hostage in the hotel almost across the street from the
                    embassy. They took the hostages to the airport, and then demanded a plane to go
                    to wherever they wanted to go to escape. They were Egyptians and the Egyptians
                    sent in a commando group, and freed the hostages, and captured the extremists —
                    the terrorists. This had happened just before we got there. There were often
                    things like that happening in Cyprus. It's located in such a place that all
                    sorts of influences come to bear on it. But we grew to love the island, and I
                    found I was a tour director a good bit of the time because we had a constant
                    stream of visitors. I could start them out in the Neolithic period in an
                    excavation and take them right through the history of that part of the world,
                    including the crusader history, right up to the present day where you could go
                    and visit the UN lines. They had troops from various nations along the line. So
                    it was a very interesting post.</p>
                <p>But by the time we were facing either a new assignment, or coming home, I was
                    ready to come home. The idea of making another adjustment like that — learning a
                    new language, learning a new culture — I was just not ready for it again. I was
                    tired of it, and I wanted to come home and set down roots, and not have to say
                    goodbye to my friends every three years, and I wanted to be back near our
                    children. By that time they were all saying; “Mommy and Daddy when are you going
                    to come home and settle down?” Also, if Galen was going to start a new career,
                    we felt we must come back before he got much older. So we did, and we've been
                    very happy here.</p>
