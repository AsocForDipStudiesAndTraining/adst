                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an oral history interview with James A. Williams.
                        It's the thirty first of October, 2003. Jim, it's good to be starting on
                        Halloween for this conversation. This is being conducted under the auspices
                        of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training at the National
                        Foreign Affairs Training Center, and Jim this is our first session. I see
                        that you were born in Washington, D.C. and a little bit later on you went to
                        Princeton University. Did you grow up in Washington, or were you here as a
                        war baby November of 1942?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I'm definitely a war baby. My father went into the Navy soon after
                    Pearl Harbor and I was part of his insurance policy to make sure there would be
                    another generation. I grew up in Arlington though. My father got out of the
                    military when the war ended. He stayed in the Navy as a civilian management
                    analyst, so essentially he worked at the Pentagon and at main Navy down on
                    Constitution Avenue when I was growing up, and my brother and I grew up in
                    Arlington, Virginia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay and you did go on to Princeton, class of 1964. Was it
                        at Princeton, or even before, that you became interested in the Foreign
                        Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I really became interested in the Foreign Service before Princeton.
                    Living in the Washington metropolitan area you hear a lot, read a lot, breathe a
                    lot of history, foreign policy, government affairs. So from a fairly early age I
                    was interested in that. I majored in history and German literature at Princeton
                    and wanted to have a career, either academics or foreign affairs that would
                    enable me to continue that interest. And on the idiosyncratic side it just
                    happened that my father and Graham Martin were college friends from Wake Forest.
                    From the earliest I can remember my parents were in touch with Graham and Dot
                    Martin, sending them care packages in Paris after World War II, corresponding
                    with them when they were in Geneva and Thailand and Rome. So hearing about the
                    Martins' adventures in the Foreign Service through perhaps a rose colored glass
                    gave me a very early interest in that profession.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Graham Martin was our ambassador in Italy when I first
                        arrived there in 1970. Of course, then he went on to Vietnam and certainly
                        he'd had a very distinguished career. I'd also known him a little bit when
                        he was a special assistant to the undersecretary for economic affairs,
                        Douglas Dillon, in the late fifties. After Princeton you did a little bit of
                        graduate study.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I had a Fulbright scholarship for a year, for two semesters, at the
                    Ludwig Maximilians University in Munich, Germany. I spent two semesters there
                    basically studying post-war German history, learning how to ski with my bride.
                    We were married when we took that trip, and getting to meet a lot of people in
                    Munich and renewing old contacts in Bonn which I had met the previous summer
                    when I worked there on a scholarship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not with the embassy in Bonn.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, I was doing academic research. I got a scholarship from Princeton
                    and lived across the river and worked in the SPD library on a project involving
                    the elections for the German national assembly after World War I.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay and when did you take the Foreign Service written
                        examination? While you were in Munich or before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, I took the written exam that summer I lived in Germany and studied
                    in Bonn. That was the summer after my junior year. It was given in some huge
                    room at the embassy in Bonn. A lot of people took it. I took it and was
                    fortunate to pass, although very narrowly because I was always a good test
                    taker. That particular day I rushed through the math section and could not
                    understand why nobody else had finished, and only three minutes before the bell
                    rang did I turn the page over and discover there was a second page. And I raced
                    to finish it, did not of course, and barely passed, or even flunked that portion
                    of the exam. That was something the oral examiners asked me about when I had the
                    oral exam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When and where did you have the oral?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I had the oral the summer after I graduated from Princeton, before we
                    went to Munich, in Washington, D.C. and passed it. But the thing they zeroed in
                    on early was why were my scores on the written test generally pretty good except
                    for math which was atrocious. I had to tell them it was because I'd been too
                    careless to look at the whole test before I put my pen down.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have to defer entry into the Foreign Service then
                        to do the Fulbright in Munich, or did it all kind of work out, the timing
                        the way you wanted it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: They allowed me to do that with some reluctance. That was another part
                    of the grilling and the oral exam, just when did I plan to come into the Foreign
                    Service if I passed the exam. Was I really an academic who wanted to go on to
                    the academic track or was I serious about wanting to come into the Foreign
                    Service? I think their questions pushed me to clarify my own thinking on that
                    point, and tell them truthfully that I planned to come into the Foreign Service
                    if I passed the test after my Fulbright in Munich.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I see you did come in September of 1965 at age 22 if
                        my math is right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: That's right. That was not unusual at the time. Many of us were A.B.
                    generalists with one or two years of post-graduate experience or as former Peace
                    Corps volunteers. There were several of those. Some had masters degrees. There
                    was only one Ph.D. in the class. He was the old man at 31, Ron Casagrande, a
                    great guy. And it just worked out perfectly in terms of the timing. We came back
                    on the ship. In those days you still took the ship to Europe and came back, at
                    least the Fulbright grantees did. And we got off the ship in August and I came
                    into the class that started sometime in September as I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you had the usual A100 orientation course at the
                        Foreign Service Institute and what happened after that? I see your first
                        assignment was to Ankara, Turkey. Did you have any language training or
                        other specific preparation for that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Not at all. The A100 course was fairly straightforward. We visited
                    various desks in the Department of State, including the German desk. We heard
                    all kinds of lecturers, some good, some bad at the old Foreign Service
                    Institute, and we had a fairly useful but short course in consular affairs, and
                    that was the essence of my training. I had gotten off of language probation by
                    passing the test in German since I had majored in German literature. I'd spent a
                    summer in Germany. There was no language training, nor was there any request by
                    me to go to Turkey. I, of course, wanted to go back to Germany and the system
                    wisely decided not to send me there. When the announcements were made, you may
                    recall the old style, for us at least, our class, we were in a windowless room
                    and somebody like the DG (Director General - head of personnel) would come into
                    the room and call out your last name. You would stand up in a more or less
                    military brace and he would give you your assignment. You would say thank you
                    sir and sit down. My name started with W I was at the end of the line. When he
                    called out Williams I stood up and said, “Yes, sir,” and he said, “Mr. Williams
                    you are going to Izmir,” and I said thank you sir and sat down without having a
                    clue where Izmir was. I asked my wife where is Izmir and she said I don't know.
                    Somebody behind us thankfully whispered he thought it was old Smyrna and I did
                    know what Smyrna was so I quickly figured out I was going to Turkey. It was a
                    country that I had never particularly studied or shown any interest in or shown
                    any desire to visit, and the system sent me there, for which I am eternally
                    grateful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you actually did go to Izmir?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, that's another story. We were going to Izmir, the assignment was
                    announced so I assume that the director general made it. Normally that was it.
                    So dutifully my wife and I wrote the letters of introduction to the consul
                    general and his wife, it was Lew Schmidt and his wife. We wrote the letter
                    saying how happy we were about our assignment, how much we looked forward to
                    coming to Izmir. I got a fairly quick reply from Lew Schmidt saying that he was
                    very happy to receive my letter, but that it was the first he had known of my
                    assignment to Izmir, and on checking with Ankara he had discovered that the
                    assignment had been changed to Ankara instead of Izmir. So, in fact, we went
                    directly to Ankara as did our household effects and our car, and not to Izmir.
                    Now the reason for that was very interesting. Unbeknownst to us, and certainly
                    Lew Schmidt and his wife never told us this, we discovered later there had been
                    some kind of scandal involving a key club and other things in Izmir. This had
                    involved a number of people in the consulate, not the Schmidts. They were sent
                    there to clean the mess up, but their predecessors and a whole lot of people
                    there had been involved, or some of them had been involved in the Key Club.
                    There were other goings on with the local community including expatriate
                    Americans. The Inspector General had come in there and basically cleaned house,
                    and I think they decided on reflection that this was not the kind of cauldron of
                    temptation into which they wanted to commit a 22 year old junior officer and his
                    bride. For reasons I suspect of prudence as well as personnel management, they
                    aborted the decision to send us to Izmir, moved the position and us to Ankara
                    instead.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It was a central complement rotation job. In fact, Ankara is a huge
                    embassy. Ankara had a wonderful set of people in those days. It's large they
                    said so they can afford the luxury of training you, and they trained me in
                    economic-commercial work, in consular work, in general services work, and so on.
                    So that's what we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you rotated among those functions and got training and
                        had some experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Had lots of experience, learned at each of them. The people who trained
                    me were at least 20 years older than I was. Some were older still, but they were
                    very nice to us. They took us in as they took in other junior officers. We were
                    not the only ones in Ankara at the time. It was a very collegial and well-run
                    post. I'll say it again because it deserves it. A very happy family and it
                    treated its people well, and trained its junior officers very well. I didn't
                    become an economic commercial officer, but I became much more literate in that
                    field than I had ever been and I was grateful for that. The consular training
                    had helped me a good deal for my rotation tour through the consular section, but
                    as is the case with many junior officers I was largely under the tutelage of the
                    senior locals in the consulate section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long were you there? Two years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It was a little over two years. Closer to two and a half years. We got
                    there in early March of '66 as I recall and left sometime in July of '68. I was
                    supposed to rotate through the other sections of the embassy. Political was the
                    one I really wanted to get to. Mutual security affairs, political/military was
                    also a possibility. Either would have been fine. The ambassador's office had a
                    staff aide position. The incumbent got married, that was Sam Peale an old
                    friend, got married and took an extended leave of absence for his honeymoon.
                    They needed a quick fill-in so they yanked me out of I think the general
                    services section where I was working, to become staff aide on fairly short
                    notice. Sam and his wife, did not come back to Ankara. They went on to another
                    assignment, and I wound up staying for the rest of my tour as staff aide to
                    Parker Hart which was a wonderful job working for a great Foreign Service
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the ambassador the whole time you were in
                        Turkey?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: He was. He had arrived about I think a year before we got there,
                    succeeding Ray Hare, and he was there when we left. He and Mrs. Hart, Jane Hart,
                    were two professionals who really took their job seriously, showed interest in
                    their people, and tried to make the place a happy one.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And who was the DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The DCM was Ed Martin. There were in those days two Ed Martins in the
                    Foreign Service. This was China Ed. Edwin W. Martin I think. He and his wife
                    Emma Rose as I recall were both the children of American missionaries, and I
                    believe both of them had been born in China or one of them had been born in
                    China and one in what was then the Ottoman Empire but then went to China later.
                    They had both had deep experience in China, spoke Chinese and this was I guess
                    an out of area tour for Ed. He was the DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were the ambassador's staff aide for the better
                        part of a year then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I was the ambassador's staff aide for about 16 months. Our first three
                    months there we lived in the DCM's residence because the DCM was on home leave
                    and the embassy didn't want the residence vacant. One interesting thing that
                    happened while we were there is that my wife was often at home. She was involved
                    in many activities with the German American Women's Club and playing tennis, but
                    usually she was home doing something and I was at the office. And while at home
                    during the daytime she frequently noticed men coming in and out of the basement
                    stairwell, going down to the basement and coming out. And sometimes when we
                    would play ping pong in the basement in the evening we would hear door shutting
                    in the basement and whispering, but never saw anybody. It was rather strange
                    environment. Well it turned out after we left our brief sojourn at the DCM
                    residence that the local cook was running a brothel in the basement of the DCM
                    residence. The RSO shop finally did a number on him and rolled the whole thing
                    up, fired the cook, and obviously put an end to the brothel. But for a while
                    there we were living on top of a brothel and perhaps even giving, unwittingly of
                    course, cover to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well I thought there would be some good story on Halloween
                        and that's a good one. Good remembrance. Anything else you want to say about
                        this first tour? Sounds like a very varied and interesting one for you.
                        Anything about U.S.-Turkey relations in that period? '66 to '68.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It was in many ways an era of good feeling, even though it was coming
                    to an end. Terrorism began soon after we left Turkey. I mean serious terrorism.
                    When we lived there Turkey was essentially a safe country for tourists and
                    foreign diplomats to travel in. This included the eastern provinces which is a
                    sensitive area for the Turks because that's where the Kurds live. That's one
                    reason the Peace Corps was first moved out of eastern Turkey and then tossed out
                    of the whole country because of great sensitivity to what the Peace Corps
                    volunteers may or may not have been doing with the Kurdish population out there.
                    But essentially in our small VW beetle which was painted bright red, we could
                    travel the length and breadth of the country alone in safety, except at night.
                    You didn't travel at night, not because of terrorism or anything like that, but
                    because shepherds and other native folk had a habit of sleeping on asphalt at
                    night, or parking their flocks there. There were no road signs, reflectors, and
                    you might have an unpleasant surprise rounding the corner and seeing the road
                    ahead of you covered by two-footed or four-footed creatures. So generally it was
                    not a good idea to drive in Turkey at night. On the whole U.S.-Turkish relations
                    were under strain continually because of the Cyprus problem in that period. One
                    of the continual refrains I heard when I was in Turkey traveling around to meet
                    local officials as a consular officer, as a vice consul, was reference to the
                    Lyndon Johnson letter of 1964 which was sent to keep Turkey from invading Cyprus
                    essentially by threatening that Turkey, if it did so, could not invoke the NATO
                    guarantee to protect it against a Russian reaction in defense of Archbishop
                    Makarios' regime. And that letter achieved its purpose but rankled deeply and it
                    was standard fare for every Turkish official who met with an American for years
                    thereafter to make a regretful reference to the Johnson letter of 1964.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>We went through the '67 crisis when I was there. That did not seriously impact
                    Turkish-American relations at my level. As far as Ann and I were concerned life
                    went on pretty much as normal. It was still fun to be with the Turks, to travel
                    and meet Turks and so forth. The one thing we were all conscious of in those
                    days and it became worse and worse and was one contributing factor I think to
                    the terrorism that was directed against Americans, was the huge presence that we
                    had, not just at the military and intelligence bases on the Black Sea and at
                    Central Anatolia, but also the wealth of that presence and the gap in the
                    standards of living and income levels between American officials and Turkish
                    officials. That was a very obvious gap; it was a matter of continuing concern to
                    Ambassador Hart and the management of embassy Ankara. We had something like
                    35,000 official Americans in Turkey in those days. That was mainly Air Force.
                    And the problems arose when these young hot-blooded Americans would come into
                    town to have a good time. We'd often run into difficulty in some of the bars in
                    Izmir, Adana in the south, and in Istanbul. Occasionally soldiers from the sixth
                    fleet would be tossed into the Bosporus when the fleet would come in for a
                    visit. I think at the end of our tour or soon thereafter, Istanbul was declared
                    off-limits for sixth fleet visits for a while because of that problem. As the
                    urban terrorism took off in the late '60s we cut back even more on our interface
                    between American military and Turkish officials. But on the whole, in the period
                    we were there, the two and a half years we were there, the relations were good.
                    I think they were managed very ably by Ambassador Hart and his team with a lot
                    of good support from the Washington folks. The Turkish government of S�leyman
                    Demirel was very proactive and actually pro-American. Demirel had been one of
                    the early Eisenhower fellows as I recall. An engineer by training who had
                    studied at least one year in the States. Spoke pretty good English and was open,
                    or at least we thought he was, to the kind of economic reform ideas that the AID
                    economic planners under Loy Jones and Jim Grant and others were pushing. He was
                    open to those ideas. In the end of course, the Turkish economy proved resistant
                    to that type of advice for some time. But Demirel and his team were a very
                    receptive audience in those days. And working with them, even at my lowly level,
                    was a pleasure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the issue of narcotics, poppy cultivation, becoming an
                        irritant in U.S.-Turkish relations, or was that a little bit later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It was becoming an irritant. Of course it became a much larger irritant
                    later on. I think the DEA office was opened a few months before we left. But it
                    had not become a major, major problem. It was becoming one, and everybody knew
                    that. Turkey of course, under the single convention, is one of the few countries
                    entitled to grow poppies legally, and that's part of the difficulty. It's a
                    legal producer or poppies and cultivator of opium. The big problem arises with
                    the diversion of a lot of that production into illicit channels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Anything else about the two and a half years in
                        Turkey?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes. My wife and I had the great fortune of going to language school
                    every day. Virtually every working day we were there. This was an AID run
                    language school. Every morning I would start with an hour, sometimes an hour and
                    a half of Turkish, and my wife would have a lesson later on in the day. There
                    was enough money for this, enough teachers for this, and again because of the
                    generous staffing of embassy Ankara, there was enough redundant manpower in the
                    offices to allow the ones who wanted to learn the language to take the time off
                    to do so. Our teachers were essentially contemporaries. Students, young
                    professionals. Essentially our age, usually married. And many of them became
                    friends. So they made very good friends as Turks tend to, and because we were so
                    close in age and interests and so forth, we had a lot of fun with them. And I
                    think that's one reason that their success in teaching Americans Turkish was
                    very high. The language is not an Indo European one, but that school did very
                    well in teaching Americans basic Turkish which is all it sought to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you had any language training before leaving
                        Washington, or only part-time while you were in Ankara?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No language training at all in Turkish. That was a matter of regret,
                    but as I think I said before it's because I passed German. The system saw no
                    need to train a newly vetted JO (junior officer) in an exotic language like
                    Turkish. So I had to pick it up while I was there, but living in the culture,
                    shopping in the culture, it was fairly easy to pick up enough Turkish to get by.
                    The Turks are extremely tolerant of foreigners trying to speak their difficult
                    tongue, and very flattered when foreigners make the effort to do so. So by the
                    end of our tour we were speaking pretty good Turkish. Ann's was better than mine
                    because she was more actively involved with school directors and teachers and
                    other recipients of the largesse of the Turkish American Women's Cultural
                    Society. I was involved more with bureaucrats and foreign ministry types and
                    visitors to Ambassador Hart's office. But I tested out at 3+ 3+ when I came
                    back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. In the summer of 1968 then you were due for
                        transfer, reassignment. Where did you go next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I was assigned to the operations center. Again an assignment I had not
                    sought or even thought of, but which turned out to be a very pleasant one
                    indeed. It was an assignment to Washington, it was shift work which meant that
                    you didn't work overtime, and you did your eight hours, maybe eight and a half
                    and then went home. You worked mornings, you worked afternoons, and you worked
                    nights on a rotational basis. It was a nice way to come back to Washington. In
                    addition, my father had gotten ill and was diagnosed with colon cancer and so I
                    needed some time to be with him and that gave me the ability to do so.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think probably a lot of people who have done these oral
                        history interviews have had assignments to the operation center. I don't
                        know if there's anything particularly unique about your experience there
                        that we ought to cover. I think what you said already gives the picture of
                        rotation, the 24 hour coverage of the op center.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Well there was nothing unique, but what I really enjoyed about it,
                    aside from getting an overview of the voluminous traffic, substantive traffic
                    that comes into the department every day and the op center gives you that, was
                    the chance when I was editor in the second half of my tour there to write
                    summaries of cables that went into the secretary of state and the principal
                    deputies' twice daily reading file. It's quite a discipline to learn to boil
                    down a complex cable into I think our rule was eight, maybe 10 lines of single
                    spaced text. That's what we learned to do. It was very good training for the
                    rest of my career in the service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Be able to write short.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Write short, and catch the spirit of it, and catch it in a way that
                    gets your interest. Sometimes we would have competitions to have catchy titles
                    in those summaries. We pushed the envelope sometimes and usually got away with
                    it, not always.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '68, '69 were of course an election year, change of
                        administration, so you helped break in a new secretary of state.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Very tangentially. Frankly, the transition of administrations didn't
                    affect what we were doing on our teams in the operations center. And I don't
                    recall it affected any of the management of SSO although of course the SS
                    leadership changed when Secretary Rogers' team came in. But the working
                    relationships were essentially the same as far as I could tell, both as an
                    assistant watch officer as well as an editor. That work did not change, nor did
                    our liaison with the military and the intelligence community in the White House
                    change. We still had the same kind of liaison relationships through posting of
                    liaison officers in the National Military Command Center as well as in SSO and
                    the use of the LDX, the Long Distance Xerography to send classified summaries,
                    other documents among the White House, the Pentagon and State, and CIA I
                    think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When Henry Kissinger came in as national security advisor
                        that was not something that had a big impact on you as a watch officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, it didn't. The transition was watched by all of us with great
                    interest, but I don't recall at this point at least any impact on our daily work
                    in SSO in the operations center.</p>

                    At least I was until I retired.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: In Spring, 1969, I started shopping around, and for the first time I
                    think I started thinking somewhat seriously about where I wanted to go after the
                    operations center. A colleague I had met, Harmon Kirby, at that time was the
                    personnel officer for NEA, Near East South Asian affairs to which in those days
                    Turkey, Greece and Cyprus belonged. So if I was anything in terms of a bureau
                    man, I was an NEA man by virtue of my service in Ankara. And I went to Harmon
                    and asked him what he thought I should do after the operations center. He gave
                    me a very persuasive reply based on the need to establish a base, and what
                    better place to have that base said Harmon than NEA. So he persuaded me to take
                    a job in NEA/ARP which is the Arabian Peninsula Affairs office. I was the
                    petroleum affairs reporting officer for the whole Arabian Peninsula and the
                    Gulf. Not Iran or Iraq, but the Arabian Peninsula side of the Gulf. I followed
                    David Newton who had the job and was a very difficult act to follow because he
                    was not only a petroleum expert which I was not, he was an Arabist which I was
                    not.</p>

                <p>WILLIAMS: I spent a lot of time reading up on the petroleum issues, meeting with
                    oil men from the major oil companies and the exploration companies who had come
                    in to tell us what was happening or seek our political support for issues.
                    Usually involving ARAMCO which was then the U.S. major producing company in
                    Saudi Arabia, in Dhahran in the eastern province. Also spent a lot of time
                    getting to know the Arabists in NEA. My strong impression was Arabists in those
                    days ran that bureau and they were a fascinating group of people. Some of them
                    were grizzled veterans of years in the desert in Muscat and exotic places like
                    that. It was a very impressive fraternity, one which I seriously thought of
                    trying to join by learning Arabic in that period, but ultimately decided not to
                    because I didn't want to spend two years learning a language. I've occasionally
                    regretted that decision, but I think it was the right one to make at the time.
                    It was a very interesting experience. Joe Sisco was the head of NEA at the time,
                    a very dynamic guy with a very strong front office. Stu Rockwell, Rodger Davies.
                    We had very strong country directors, as they were called, in charge of the
                    offices. Bill Brewer was my boss. First rate Arabist and officer. Talcott Seeley
                    was across the hall running the Syria/Jordan/Iraq/Lebanon desk. Richard Parker
                    was around doing the Egypt desk; Haywood Stackhouse ran the Arab/Israel affairs
                    desk. So we had some very strong personalities and some very interesting
                    discussions in the weekly staff meetings that I attended. I also at this time
                    tried to learn French, or continue my efforts to learn French which went on for
                    my whole life and never succeeded, by going to the early morning class at FSI. I
                    finally had to give that up after about five months because I was just
                    exhausted. Our first child had been born at the time and had colic which kept
                    him up all night and kept us up all night, so there was no way I was going to be
                    able to do my job, learn French, and help my wife with managing the colicky baby
                    so French had to go.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you spend a lot of time interacting with the economic
                        bureau, with other agencies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Spent a lot of time with a particular office in Economic Affairs, Fuels
                    and Energy (FSE). Jim Akins was in charge, a wonderful genius really in terms of
                    understanding the way the energy industry works. My counterpart was Warren Clark
                    who was extremely helpful in educating me from about point 0 in terms of how
                    petroleum works and what it's about. The only training I had for that job after
                    I left the operations center was a week in Houston, or five days in Houston.
                    They sent me to a conference sponsored by the American Petroleum Institute in
                    Houston which basically exposed us to a lot of ideas from people in the
                    industry, both oil and gas, as to how it works politically and economically. It
                    was a useful introduction, especially for somebody like myself who had no prior
                    experience in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you spend a lot of time interacting with the Saudi
                        embassy or other local embassies in Washington, or were things done
                        primarily in the field?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Primarily in the field in those days. Hermann Eilts was the ambassador
                    in Saudi and anybody who knows him knows it would be done mainly through the
                    embassy because that's the way he wanted to run things, and he did it very well.
                    I did have a contact at the Saudi embassy, Mohammed Madani, but it was really
                    not a major contact. It was as much social as substantive because in those days
                    we at least at the third secretary level did not do much business with the Saudi
                    embassy. Much more productive contact, just because of the personalities
                    involved, was the team of the Washington office of ARAMCO which, as I said, was
                    the major producer in Saudi Arabia at the time, run by U.S. majors. John
                    Pendleton ran the office and Robert Van Person was his deputy. They were
                    essentially lobbyist and liaison folk between ARAMCO and key elements of the
                    executive and legislative branches. Very able. They both knew the oil industry
                    very well. Person was the child of missionaries who had grown up in the Arab
                    world so he spoke fluent Arabic and understood the world very well. And
                    Pendleton had spent time as a young man out of college in Turkey of all places,
                    so we shared an interest in Turkey based on that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was before OPEC, or had OPEC gotten started by then?
                        It was certainly before the big price increase.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I believe OPEC had gotten started by then, but it had not flexed its
                    muscle in any way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there major issues that you had to deal with, or was
                        it more keeping track of developments, troubleshooting sort of role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: As I recall it was more troubleshooting than anything. I was usually
                    the reporting officer or the note taker when they would come in to talk about
                    things. Production levels, efforts by the Saudis to raise them, efforts by
                    others maybe not to raise them so much. But I don't recall any of the specific
                    issues too well. There was no big trouble in those days. It was a fairly
                    smoothly functioning relationship between the Saudis and ARAMCO. Been going on
                    for a long time. The oil issues that were more contentious usually involved the
                    former sheikdoms of the Persian Gulf that were coming into independence once the
                    British started pulling back from east of Suez. That was happening in the Gulf
                    when I served in the NE/ARP. And the question then was where are the boundaries
                    of these sheikdoms? The land boundaries had often not been demarcated. The
                    maritime boundaries were subject to dispute, particularly with Iran which under
                    the Shah in those days was very muscular in asserting claims not just to
                    continental shelf, but to offshore islands such as Abu Musa and the Tunbs. The
                    issues that involved more crisis-like scenarios usually involved as I said the
                    sheikdoms, those islands, and the boundaries. Not so much ARAMCO itself.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Yemen part of the area covered by the office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes it was, and I can recall one or two discussions involving Yemen in
                    those days. Usually not with oil. It was more the situation between Yemen and
                    South Yemen because they were separate countries at the time and the South Yemen
                    was quite radical socialist. Bill Eagleton had been our last principal officer
                    in Aden as I recall and he was pulled out when I was in the NE/ARP. I remember
                    when he came back. But the issues were more political and military between the
                    two Adens, between the two Yemens, between South Yemen and Saudi Arabia, between
                    South Yemen and Muscat, things like that. Oil was not a big part of that at
                    all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see your job description described you as an economic
                        petroleum affairs officer. I assume that petroleum took up most of your time
                        as opposed to other economic issues.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Virtually all of it. The other issue that took up a lot of time was a
                    desalinization plant that was finally built in Jeddah on the Red Sea. The Office
                    of Saline Waters in the Department of Interior under Stuart Udall in the Kennedy
                    administration had a mandate which continued for many years thereafter to
                    promote American desalinization technology worldwide. We persuaded the Saudis
                    early on to buy into this, and they did. They had the money for it. And the
                    plant was built by a consortium of companies, Europeans and others. Office of
                    Saline Waters was the supervisor, reporting to the embassy in Jeddah under
                    Hermann Eilts. But it had to deal with Dutch and British and German contractors
                    and subcontractors in a consortium that the Saudis as I recall had put together.
                    It was not a smoothly functioning operation; there were delays inevitably as
                    there are in that part of the world. There were suspicions, backbiting,
                    accusations, and one of my jobs was to trek over to the Department of Interior
                    about once a week to hold the hand of the folks in the Office of Saline Waters
                    who wanted to pull the plug on the whole thing because they were exasperated
                    with the way those foreigners were not showing sufficient appreciation for our
                    technology. In the end the plant was built. After I left NE/ARP it was completed
                    and went online as now one of I think many desalinization plants the Saudis
                    have. But it was the first in those days, sort of a demonstration case of U.S.
                    technology in that part of the world. But it invoked a lot of neuralgic feelings
                    in a lot of corners before it was over. And I like to think that my efforts and
                    those of Bill Brewer and others in NE/ARP helped smooth things out, both with
                    the Department of Interior and with the folks representing the U.S. government
                    in Jeddah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, how long were you in NE/ARP?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I recall it was a little over a year. Then I responded to a siren song
                    that came from the seventh floor to go back up as staff aide to Undersecretary
                    of State John Irwin. He had succeeded Elliot Richardson on fairly short notice
                    in that job, and Richardson took his whole team with him, or most of them, and
                    Irwin came in to get a whole new team. The staff aide to Richardson was an old
                    friend from the op center, John Stempel, and John urged me to consider applying
                    for the job of staff aide to Undersecretary Irwin. I was not that happy in
                    NE/ARP because I found a lot of the work was frustrating. It involved
                    terminology, names, family relationships in the Arab world that I was totally
                    ignorant of and it was very difficult to get my mind around it. Having enjoyed
                    immensely my time as a generalist aide in SSO, I thought it would be more fun to
                    perhaps go back to the seventh floor as staff aide than to stay on in NE/ARP. So
                    I was broken out of NE/ARP when Mr. Irwin picked me for that job, and went up to
                    the seventh floor for two more years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had also had experience as the staff aide to
                        Ambassador Hart in Turkey.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: That's right. I started specializing as a staff aide. There were
                    plusses and minuses to it. I enjoyed everything I did in those capacities. It
                    was very educational; it was a lot of fun. You didn't own anything in terms of
                    issues, but you got to work the ball in various ways. The one who recruited me
                    for the job with Undersecretary Irwin was really Nick Veliotes who was the
                    senior aide and really set up the office for Mr. Irwin. Working with Nick and
                    his team and with Mr. Irwin was a lot of fun. I really enjoyed every minute of
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went there sometime in 1970.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: '69.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's see, you were in NE/ARP '69-'70 and then went to the
                        undersecretary's office sometime in '70.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think maybe where we ought to start is just to talk a
                        little bit more about the way that office was structured. Mr. Irwin was
                        basically number two in the State Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: That's right; we called it undersecretary in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As opposed to undersecretary for political affairs or
                        economic affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: There was an undersecretary for political affairs, for economic
                    affairs, and for management, and there was an undersecretary, and that meant a
                    lot of undersecretaries. But that was later changed to deputy secretary. But he
                    was the number two under William Rogers, the secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, you were talking about the way that Undersecretary
                        Irwin's office was structured how many staff there was and how it had
                        changed from the previous undersecretary Elliot Richardson.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Richardson had a large team that had spilled into offices adjacent to
                    what was normally considered the undersecretary's suite. For whatever reason,
                    Mr. Irwin decided to have a more conventional smaller office and it was really
                    quite small; her had an executive secretary - career Foreign Service officer
                    Velma Hein, as I recall - Nick Veliotes who ran the office as the senior
                    assistant. I was the staff aide, there was only one staff aide, and each of us
                    had a secretary so that's two more, and then there was an executive assistant
                    who was a very bright lawyer from a New York firm, Scott Custer, who Mr. Irwin
                    brought in. Irwin has been a lawyer with a prestigious New York firm for many
                    years, was married to Jane Watson of the IBM Watsons and knew his way around New
                    York very well. My recollection is he had known Scott or Scott's parents from
                    before New York and took Scott aboard as his domestic political advisor and
                    Scott had a secretary also. So that was essentially it. We worked very closely
                    as an office and Mr. Irwin as an undersecretary with Art Hartman who was the
                    head of the Policy Planning Office in those days, with Ron Spiers who was head
                    of political military affairs and Tom Pickering and Cy Wise who were part of his
                    team. And with Ted Eliot and the folks in the staff secretariat, who managed the
                    paper flow. It was a well-run office and I think a very happy as well as
                    productive one because of Nick's amazing ability to get people to work well
                    together. And Mr. Irwin's overall influence. He was a very good man to work for.
                    We had a lot of fun and we worked very, very hard.</p>

                <p>WILLIAMS: I don't remember too much about Rogers' office. I interacted somewhat
                    usually directly with Rush Taylor who was my counterpart for most of those two
                    years in Secretary Rogers' office. Nick and Scott had their interactions but I
                    don't recall the names at this point. Surprisingly we didn't have that much
                    interaction with Rogers' office as an office. It was more issue specific or
                    personality driven. There was a lot more interaction between the office of the
                    undersecretary when Irwin was there with Alexis Johnson's office; he was the
                    undersecretary of political affairs with a fairly good-sized staff. With PEA
                    which is what it was called we had a lot more daily interaction than with the
                    secretary's office.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Undersecretary Irwin have particular responsibilities
                        or specialties that he worked on, as opposed to the secretary or the
                        undersecretary for political affairs? Other principles?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: There was not a clear division of labor. The main one I remember is
                    that Rogers gave him responsibility for a Middle East oil crisis that broke out
                    in those two years. It was a pricing issue, and I forget what triggered it
                    exactly, but Secretary Rogers gave that to Mr. Irwin. Mr. Irwin of course had
                    known in his earlier capacity the companies and their lawyers in New York who
                    represented ARAMCO and the other U.S. oil majors. That was a major asset in
                    terms of his ability to have credibility as well as street smarts in talking
                    these issues in the region. He also relied heavily on Jim Akins whom he took
                    along as his substantive petroleum advisor on dealing with the issues. That and
                    the chairmanship of the board of the Foreign Service which was his
                    responsibility. He spent a lot of time dealing with Bill Macomber, in the
                    undersecretary for management's office, and others on the agenda for those
                    meetings. Infrequently he would meet with some of the AFSA (American Foreign
                    Service Association) folk, but Macomber and his staff, and I think there was
                    even a specific office for the board of the Foreign Service, spent a lot of time
                    with Mr. Irwin briefing him on the board of the Foreign Service issues.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No I did not. I stayed back. I was the one who stayed back when
                    Veliotes and Custer traveled. They liked to travel and I was happy to stay home
                    and just get a breather when they were gone. I was the custodian of the paper
                    flow so to speak through the staff secretariat and when they were gone the paper
                    flow dried up significantly so I was able to get some down time. I did not
                    travel with them.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: There were things. King Hussein threw Black September out of Jordan
                    when I was in Mr. Irwin's office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess I have to ask you about relations with the NSC
                        (National Security Council), with Henry Kissinger. Was that something that
                        occupied you or John Irwin, a lot, or was it pretty much left to the
                        secretary's office and Rogers to try to cushion that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I think it occupied or preoccupied most of the principals on the
                    seventh floor and their staff. The NSC under Henry Kissinger was an extremely
                    aggressive, forward-leaning operation, and they had the ability to issue these
                    taskers. National Security Study Memorandum (NSSM) I think is what it was called
                    which sometimes Kissinger would sign, sometimes President Nixon would sign; it
                    was the same thing. It meant that the White House was telling you to do
                    something. And one way that Kissinger took charge of an issue would be by
                    issuing an NSSM on something, let's say Middle East petroleum, and tasking the
                    bureaucracy to produce reports on this study which would then be coordinated and
                    discussed in the policy sense by committees that he would chair. There was a
                    fair amount of frustration as I recall on the seventh floor by the ability of
                    the NSC to do that successfully in most cases. In fact, one reason that
                    Secretary Rogers was interested in sending Mr. Irwin on this trip to the Middle
                    East was to reassert the State Department's leadership in this issue. I don't
                    remember exactly when this decision was made, but it followed a series of
                    disappointments and bruising discussions over the NSC's ability to take charge
                    of issues and to win in the bureaucratic arena. And Rogers saw it as one way we
                    could perhaps as an institution begin to reverse that would be to send Jack
                    Irwin his able deputy to the Middle East to try to patch together the solution
                    to the problem. Kissinger opposed that mission, privately at least. But in the
                    end did nothing to block it as far as I know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else that particularly comes to mind about your
                        time in the undersecretary's office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Perhaps because I had been a stickler for grammar when I was in school
                    and university, and had been an editor in the operations center, I was struck by
                    how much bad writing came up through the system. I made more than a few people
                    mad with my red penciling with some of their product. I was told to do this by
                    Nick and expected to produce a quality product. Because I had very high
                    standards of grammar and syntax I took it upon myself to leave the red pencil
                    things for redoing or just have them redone by my secretary. Unfortunately this
                    was before the era of word processing so every time you red penciled something
                    it had to be done from scratch because it had to be letter perfect if it was for
                    the signature or action of the undersecretary. But there was a lot of sloppy
                    writing. I'm not saying it was substantively bad, it was substantively usually
                    right on the mark, but it was phrased in a way that would just make you cringe
                    sometimes. So if I were doing this again I would more seriously consider trying
                    to force the line officers who process that paper to do that job rather than do
                    it myself. At the time I thought it would be quicker, and I probably had a
                    really arrogant view it would be better if I did it myself and just made the
                    decision. But it tended to draw me more than I should have been drawn I think in
                    retrospect into the minutia of margins, of spelling, of grammar, and all. This
                    is before we had spell check and other such fancy aids.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When Secretary Rogers was traveling abroad; Mr. Irwin
                        would be acting secretary. When that happened, did that change things for
                        you and for the office significantly, or was it pretty much the same?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Well the paper flow increased significantly when that happened because
                    we didn't delegate our normal work as Undersecretary Irwin's office, we just
                    continued that plus the work that the secretary had to do, or that had to be
                    done by the acting secretary in the secretary's absence. So the staff studies or
                    the action folders that would come into us from Ted Eliot's shop next door
                    increased significantly when Secretary Rogers was away and Mr. Irwin was acting.
                    Maybe we had 50 percent more of that stuff. This did not last for a long period,
                    but for a week, maybe 10 days that would be a huge extra amount of work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You continued to be the only staff assistant in that
                        office throughout your entire time and what did that mean in terms of your
                        working hours?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Well they were pretty long to the occasional disgruntlement of my wife
                    who had a baby to take care of and wanted to see more of her husband and baby's
                    daddy than she did. I was assigned to the job for one year and it was renewable.
                    I renewed it for a second year because I liked the office, I liked the team
                    there, I liked the issues, and I didn't see anything better to do in the
                    department at that time. So for the two years that I was in there I was the only
                    staff aide. But my secretaries and Nick's secretary, sometimes Nick, sometimes
                    even Scott would pitch in occasionally when it got tough and help push things
                    through. The proofreading and that sort of thing, the enforcing of deadlines was
                    not that difficult. It was just the volume that sometimes got you. But it did
                    require long hours. I would typically get in the office about 7:15, 7:30 and
                    just as typically would get home about 7:15, 7:30 at night. So 12 hour days were
                    the norm. Mr. Irwin worked even longer hours. He lived next door in the
                    Watergate apartments so he had a very short commute, and was used to very, very
                    long hours I think from his time in New York City as a lawyer.</p>

                <p>WILLIAMS: Weekends as I recall, typically half days on Saturdays. I don't
                    remember ever going in on a Sunday although sometimes as I recall Nick did and
                    Mr. Irwin would have stuff brought out to him or sent by a courier anytime he
                    wanted. On the weekends or when he was on vacation, but his immediate staff did
                    not get involved in couriering stuff to him.</p>

                <p>WILLIAMS: Just that it was a lot of fun. One of my great blessings in the Foreign
                    Service is I've really enjoyed all of my jobs. Some more than others as I've
                    indicated, but it was usually a lot of fun, I can honestly say I was rarely
                    bored and it's very important for me as a human being not to be bored. I value
                    not being bored almost above everything else. And wonderful people to work with.
                    I really enjoyed meeting all of the people from the bureaucracy whom I met when
                    I was staff aide for Mr. Irwin. It really gave you an overview.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a lot to do with bureau staff assistants or
                        desk officers or were you pretty much dealing with people on the seventh
                        floor so to speak?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Mainly the seventh floor, but sometimes depending on the issue I would
                    get involved with bureau staff assistance or desk officers. It turned out that
                    three or four times when I was with Mr. Irwin he had to make decisions involving
                    Most Favored Nation status for Romania. And Ed Segall was the desk officer for
                    Romania who worked that issue and wrote the memos and I would find myself
                    dealing with Ed to clarify things. One of my jobs was to put little notes on top
                    of the action memos giving an extra fillip of information or an extra aspect
                    that I thought deserved comment to Mr. Irwin. And Ed or I would talk about it
                    sometime when it would come up for the third or fourth time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems to me that Mr. Irwin was involved in a
                        nationalization issue involving Peru. Do I remember that correctly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Chile. This was the whole Ed Korry case and Allende, Frei and Allende.
                    The nationalization of the Chilean copper industry and the destabilization of
                    Chile after Allende was elected and the final coup that killed him. Mr. Irwin
                    was involved as I recall when Ed Korry was the ambassador in Chile, writing very
                    long and very literate cables on the politics of the copper industry there. I
                    don't remember any specifics, I really don't, but I do remember that was a heavy
                    consumer of his reading time and policy discussions because of what Korry was
                    saying and what Allende's party was talking about doing or was doing, I don't
                    remember specifically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, anything else about your time there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Well, the reason I left is Nick Veliotes who at some time just before
                    he'd come there, had done a survey for the Department of Substantive Reporting
                    Positions in the Foreign Service. I forget the reason he did that. He was tasked
                    by somebody. But Nick is an extremely broad-gauged forward thinking supervisor.
                    He said that he thought the best upcoming job for me would be a political
                    reporting officer position in Nicosia which he had classified. It was a job
                    reclassification study, that's what it was. He had been involved with that with
                    a bunch of other people and had given a purview of all the substantive reporting
                    jobs, political and economic, in the Foreign Service. He knew that one for some
                    reason, or he remembered it for some reason and said that's the one you should
                    do after you learn Greek. And as much as I had learned Turkish, had loved
                    Turkey, I was enchanted with the idea of getting into Greece. I had always
                    wanted to learn Greek and had barely learned Latin. I thought that was a very
                    good idea. So essentially I got Nick to get Mr. Irwin to suggest to the
                    personnel system that the staff aide James Williams should go into Greek
                    language training and from there to the Greek language reporting position in
                    embassy Nicosia. And that's what happened. It was wired much to the surprise and
                    perhaps to the chagrin of David Popper who was the ambassador in Cyprus at the
                    time. I doubt that he was consulted by Nick or Mr. Irwin on that, but he was
                    gracious when I met him before I went out to post. He was very gracious, but it
                    was a surprise to him. And it was a wired job; it took me many years before I
                    understood the implications of that. I was just happy to see it happen because
                    Nick and Mr. Irwin were going to make it happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So after about four years in the department you spent a
                        year doing Greek language training at the Foreign Service Institute and went
                        to Cyprus.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: That's right. The language training in those days in Greek was done by
                    Tacchius and Aliki Soupounzious, a married couple from Athens who had been doing
                    this then for probably 15 or 20 years. And continued for many years thereafter.
                    They were probably put on this earth to teach Americans their language. They had
                    phenomenal success rates in teaching Americans with all kinds of language
                    aptitudes pretty fluent conversational Greek. Tacchius had many tricks to do
                    that. Aliki was more literarily inclined, but they both managed to get
                    tremendous efforts out of their students and very good results. So we had them
                    both, Tacchius would start us with the fine points and the grammar and so on,
                    and Aliki would bring in the literature later. But the two of them I thought
                    were a very effective team. We had about eight or 10 people in the course, and
                    some left after six months, some stayed for 10. I was asked at one point by the
                    desk if I wanted to go out to Nicosia early after only six months and I said no
                    because I was really learning the language and I thought it very important to
                    have 10 months before I went out there.</p>

                <p>WILLIAMS: I don't recall that spouses had that option in those days. There were
                    no spouses in the Greek course. They must have had it because I think there was
                    a spouse in the Turkish course which was right next door to us at FSI at the
                    time. But in the Greek course there were none, so Ann did not unfortunately get
                    any Greek until she got out to Nicosia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In those days was there an area studies component to the
                        language training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: There was. We met once every Tuesday afternoon I think to discuss
                    assigned readings on Greek culture and history. It was very interesting
                    because... I'm forgetting his name, he was charg� in Cairo... he was a Greek
                    American from Chicago who that year was assigned to FSI and he led our
                    discussions. Burgess, Don Burgess. Knew the Greek American scene very well
                    having grown up in it in Chicago, but also knew a lot about the history of the
                    culture of the old country. And it was very educational and a very useful
                    complement to what we were learning in terms of the language. The two reinforce
                    each other very well. It could have been done more intensively, I'm glad it
                    wasn't because we could use the extra time depending on our preferences to
                    either learn more vocabulary or read more history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you do anything in terms of area studies jointly with
                        the Turkish language students, or was it all quite separate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It was quite separate. There was a fair amount of rivalry between the
                    two departments, Greeks and Turks being Greeks and Turks of course. I think it
                    started with the teachers who were not unpleasant to each other but they were
                    not that collegial sometimes. The students had no trouble getting along but
                    there were no joint efforts, except I think once or twice we might have done a
                    restaurant outing together. Oddly enough the restaurant outings or the field
                    trips as Tacchius called them were very good ways to start getting a primitive
                    vocabulary and some fluency because we would go to the old Astor restaurant
                    downtown. I forget where it was but they had belly dancing some nights and they
                    had a Greek menu and Greek speaking waiters. And we would in our best pidgin
                    Greek order something. What we thought we were ordering we usually got. And talk
                    about the belly dancers. And just in a very casual, relaxed way become
                    comfortable with some of the vocabulary and the grammar. It was effective,
                    that's all I can say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there others in the Greek language training who were
                        also going to Cyprus, or were the others all going to Greece?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I was the only one going to Cyprus. In fact the job to which I was
                    going was the only Greek language designated job in Cyprus at the time. I don't
                    know if it was when you were there or not.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think we just had the one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The others were going to Athens as deputy chief of station, as
                    commercial officer, political officer and two were going to Thessaloniki as I
                    recall. There was a USAA officer and a political officer. So it was a fairly
                    mixed group. We didn't talk too much about Cyprus, either in Don Burgess'
                    seminars or in the language instruction. We talked mainly about Greece and what
                    it's like in Greece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you went to Cyprus in what, the summer of 1973?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Summer of '73 we went there. I remember coming off the plane late at
                    night from Frankfurt, there at the bottom were Mike Austrian who was my
                    counterpart in the political section on the Turkish side, and Lindsay Grant the
                    DCM and his wife Barry so it was a very nice welcome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was David Popper still the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, he had moved on to Chile I think. At the time it was Bob McCloskey.
                    He didn't stay very long because Kissinger kept pulling him back to do special
                    things and finally pulled him back for good before he went on to Greece. When
                    Bob would be pulled back to Washington, his wife Ann would stay in Nicosia
                    because the girls were going to school and I think Ann, his wife, enjoyed
                    Nicosia very much. So we saw a lot of them. In fact, we still laugh about the
                    story that our lift van of effects from America caught hoof and mouth disease
                    when it got to Turkey. At least that's what the Greek customs authorities said.
                    So the ship with our lift van which had stopped in Izmir was not allowed by the
                    Cypriot authorities to land in Famagusta because they were worried about hoof
                    and mouth disease. And no question about it there was hoof and mouth disease in
                    Turkey and the island of Cyprus then as now had a very fine vital sanitary
                    record. They were not about to jeopardize it by importing some pathogen from
                    Turkey. But the idea that a lift van would have it was a bit far fetched. In the
                    lift van were our clothes, our son's toys. It went back to Baltimore and sat in
                    the harbor until it could be loaded on another freighter which brought it to
                    Cyprus not by way of a Turkish port but by other ports. So we finally got our
                    winter clothes as I recall in the first half of December. It gets cold in Cyprus
                    before then and so I remember borrowing Bob McCloskey's sweaters. I think Ann
                    borrowed a few things from Ann McCloskey, other members of the community lent
                    our son some stuff until our real things would arrive. We knew they would get
                    there eventually but it took a long time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay and you were the Greek language political officer.
                        Were you the head of the political section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, that was one of the unfortunate aspects of wiring the assignment
                    the way it had been done. Mike Austrian and I were the same rank exactly. I
                    think we'd even been promoted the same year. But he was senior at post, had been
                    there a year or more when I got there and should have been by right the head of
                    the section. De facto he was. I deferred to him more often than not because he
                    knew the island and the politics and the situation much better than I did. At
                    least the first year or so. But because we were the same rank he was not
                    formally made Joe Lorenz's successor until the next year when he got promoted
                    and I didn't. So then it was fairly easy to do that, but at that point we had
                    the other problem of the Turkish invasion, the murder of Rodger Davies and so
                    forth. So who was in charge of the political section didn't really matter. But
                    no, Mike and I were more or less yoked to the same harness. I covered the Greek
                    side, he the Turkish side. There was some overlap because Mike was very able and
                    had been there a while and he covered some of the Greek side, and I had been in
                    Turkey and spoke some Turkish so I tried to meet some of the Turkish Cypriot
                    folks as well. But the sense of the division of labor was as it is today: one
                    covers the Turkish Cypriot side and one the Greek Cypriot side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your role though as the Greek language political officer
                        was primarily with the Greek Cypriots.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Exactly. All those parties. And new parties and deputies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that what you did primarily? Work with politicians,
                        members of parliament, deputies, did a lot of reporting? Was there an
                        economic officer in the embassy as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes, economic and commercial work was done by Jay Graham. Cristalla was
                    one of his assistants. Chris Yakabedes. And they had a small commercial library
                    so that was a separate operation entirely. And I focused initially on the
                    populations you mentioned to work on my Greek and to meet the people who were
                    allegedly the movers and shakers in the Greek Cypriot community. I must say, on
                    the Greek it was an effort because as you know Cypriots, Greek and Turkish in
                    those days usually spoke the King's English and getting them to speak to you in
                    Greek was a bit artificial. I had to insist in some cases. I became a bit of a
                    pig about it because I really wanted to get my Greek under control. In some
                    cases it worked, but most of them after a while were happy to play the game.
                    Several contacts whom I used to see regularly were quite happy to speak Greek
                    with me even though it was not the Greek they spoke on Cyprus of course. I spoke
                    Athenian Greek. I frankly then and now cannot understand the Cypriot dialect.
                    It's just too difficult and I never learned it. But they were happy to speak the
                    Hoh Greek with me whenever I came calling. So yes, I would call the political
                    leaders, the newspaper publishers who were often the same thing. This was in the
                    day when EOKA led by Grivas was trying to unhorse or assassinate Makarios. They
                    didn't care which. That was a matter of considerable interest to Washington as
                    well as the embassy and the agency was also involved so anybody who'd get a
                    handle of EOKA presumably was contributing to the national interest. Kikis was
                    able to get me a meeting once with Kikos Constantino who was one of the deputies
                    of EOKA. Very presentable guy who was very happy to speak to me in Greek and we
                    had a very pleasant conversation in somebody's apartment about Makarios and the
                    island and so forth. But he didn't reveal any secrets. This was my first time as
                    a political officer, reporting officer. I was really learning my trade. And it
                    took a little bit longer than I thought it would. I would have become a very
                    good one if summer of '74 had gone differently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe we ought to begin talking about the summer of '74.
                        Maybe you want to first describe in general what happened and then maybe
                        talk about to what extent this was anticipated or what sort of warnings
                        there were and what happened in the period leading up to July of '74.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: There was in effect a civil war going on in Cyprus when we got there
                    between the government, the duly elected legitimate government of Archbishop
                    Makarios and the EOKA-B organization led by George Grivas the hero of EOKA, and
                    supported very clearly by the military junta that was then running Athens, the
                    government of Greece. If you look at the reporting files which I did when I was
                    studying Greek that year at FSI and when I got to post, if you look at the very
                    thick files of the political section, easily most of it has to do with incident
                    reporting. Bombs in mailboxes, bombs at police stations. Assassination attempts
                    on country roads. There was a lot of this type of activity, designed
                    deliberately to upset the regime of Makarios, and perhaps to stimulate some
                    broad grassroots move to throw him out. It never succeeded. It was amateurish;
                    it was rarely fatal although people did die when these things went off. One of
                    my contacts was the deputy minister of agriculture who got in a car one morning
                    and turned on the ignition and blew his legs off and died soon thereafter in the
                    hospital. Car bombs were favored, but usually they were not fatal. The bombs at
                    the police stations and the mailboxes and so on made more noise than anything,
                    but they were duly reported. And so there was a lot of this stuff going on, not
                    just in Nicosia, but all over the island. Essentially that fight on the island
                    reflected a fight between Makarios and the Athens junta over some basic issues
                    involving Hellenism, or the interest of the Greek world. The junta was not used
                    to taking sass from anybody, being a bunch of military colonels essentially, one
                    general. And Makarios as an elected president was not used to taking orders from
                    a junta. It was a basic incompatibility of personalities and institutions. This
                    had been going on as I recall for about two years when it culminated in the
                    summer of '74. I don't remember exactly when Grivas was sent back to the island
                    by the junta, or went back to the island and was supported by the junta, but it
                    was sometime in the early '70s. There had been efforts by the junta to kill
                    Makarios before the summer of '74. He was in a helicopter once taking off from
                    some point in Nicosia and the helicopter came under fire. The pilot was killed,
                    barely managed to land the helicopter, and Makarios walked away from it. When I
                    was on the island in late '73 early '74 he was driving in his motorcade from the
                    Pedieos to Nicosia and there was an ambush and some members of the motorcade
                    were hit, he was not. But once again the effort had been to kill him. And there
                    were other efforts of which we learned through intelligence sources and which
                    thanks to very vigorous work by Ambassador Popper and others, we believe, were
                    aborted because of our intervention. We told the Greeks we knew it and to back
                    off, and for whatever reason they did. But after the Athens Polytechnic riots in
                    November of '73 the Greek junta changed. The old guy who had been in charge
                    since the coup of April '67 was thrown out, George Papadopoulos and succeeded by
                    somebody who can best be described as a thug, Demetrius Ioannidis who was head
                    of the Greek military police. Unlike Papadopoulos, Ioannidis was a much more
                    secretive, remote personality who did not relish contact with foreigners and who
                    hated Makarios apparently with a passion. So the level of violence directed by
                    the junta against Makarios' regime ratcheted upwards significantly after
                    Ioannidis took over. It has to be remembered that in those days the Greek
                    government had major instruments of power on the island, first and foremost
                    being the National Guard which is manned primarily by Greek Cypriot recruits, or
                    draftees I forget which. But officered and commanded by people seconded from
                    Athens from the regular Greek army. So the National Guard essentially was a
                    Greek military arm on the island. That is indeed what the junta used to
                    overthrow Makarios in July of '74. They also had the contingent, the LDIC under
                    the London Zurich accords as the Turks do, but the Turks had nothing comparable
                    to a national guard in those days. So as I recall, what happened, and this was
                    reported by embassy Athens as well as by embassy Nicosia, the president of
                    Greece was a former general named Gizikis who wrote Makarios a letter about
                    things that Athens expected him to do in the interest of Hellenism and in the
                    interest of following the dictates of the national center which is the
                    euphemistic way that Athens described itself in those days. Athens was the
                    national center. The phrase was the center decides and we execute. In other
                    words we salute smartly and do whatever Athens tells us. And that was not the
                    style of Archbishop Makarios, or indeed of many Greek Cypriots. Anyway, Makarios
                    who was something of a high stakes gambler decided to publish the Gizikis
                    letter, the demands, and his own reply which basically said I am an elected
                    leader of Cypriot Hellenism and expect to be treated with more respect than
                    you've shown me. And publishing those exchange of letters which he did in June
                    apparently is what drove Ioannidis over the edge because the national guard
                    launched a coup against Makarios in mid-July which was designed to kill him in
                    the palace and seize the government. They succeeded in the second goal. They
                    narrowly failed in the first. Makarios was able to escape through a tunnel from
                    the presidential palace that went somewhere out back and hail a cab that took
                    him to Paphos as I recall on the western side of the island. Took a few hours.
                    And from there the British helicoptered him down to the sovereign base area from
                    which he flew to London. But they did succeed in taking over the government, and
                    the ministers of Makarios' regime were very quickly replaced with right wing
                    types, EOKA-B types frankly most of whom I had never heard of and I think most
                    of the people in the embassy had never heard of. They were essentially
                    apolitical businessmen of some kind, not terribly successful, but reputable. But
                    of a right wing persuasion considered to be sufficiently nationalist to be
                    installed in those jobs. And the head of it all was of course the infamous Nikos
                    Sampson who had made his bones by killing Turkish Cypriots and Greek officers
                    and civilians during the EOKA period and the early crises of the early '60s on
                    the island.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Killed some British too I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: He did. He assassinated (British servicemen) and I think he was caught
                    and supposed to hang, and then it all ended when independence came. He was a
                    thug and a murderer, but for whatever reason, one of the great mistakes that
                    Greece ever made, they installed Sampson as the president. This was the red flag
                    that brought the Turks in. In that brief period between the coup and the Turkish
                    invasion or peace operation as Ankara likes to call it, Mike Austrian and I did
                    our best to remeet some of our contacts at the foreign ministry who were on the
                    America desk and Costa Spilavakes was one and there were a couple of others. We
                    went by the foreign ministry just to see if they were alive because they were
                    doing a horrible amount of shooting downtown. I remember driving to the foreign
                    ministry over a road that was literally covered with casings of bullets that had
                    been fired by I guess the National Guard or the defenders, Greek Cypriot
                    defenders against the national guard a day or two before. And we were very happy
                    to find our contacts alive and well in the foreign ministry. Doing nothing
                    because they didn't know what their status was, but they were there and so we
                    saw them. We were later chastised by Lindsay for that, he was the DCM at the
                    time, for doing something that conveyed recognition of the regime that we had
                    not yet decided to recognize. That had not been our thought when we went to see
                    these folks, so we were never chastised by Washington and the recognition issue
                    was mooted by the Turkish invasion and the collapse of the junta installed
                    government of Sampson.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't there some contact either by the charg� or maybe by
                        you with the foreign minister in this five day period or so, who I think was
                        the brother of ambassador of Nicos Dimitriou.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yeah, it was Dimis Dimitriou. I think Rodger Davies had become
                    ambassador just a few days earlier. He had arrived I think in early July just in
                    time for the July Fourth reception at that old building we used to use. We had a
                    lovely garden reception for him on July Fourth. But he had just arrived, just
                    off the plane. And the foreign minister was Dimis Dimitriou, the brother of the
                    ambassador in Washington, and I forget if he called Ambassador Davies or Davies
                    called him, but there was a contact. A pragmatic one. I don't recall what the
                    agenda was. It may have involved the issue of recognition. I just don't
                    remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But we certainly didn't consider that it was in fact
                        recognition at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No. Nor did Mike and I consider that calling on people who had been in
                    a shot up building raised the recognition issue. It was not really on our radar.
                    One that I did on my own that I was never reprimanded for or praised for either,
                    I tried to meet some of these new ministers and their deputies in the week of
                    calm. And surprisingly enough I was able to talk to several of them. They were
                    uniformly men of course. Modest business backgrounds. Had some education. All
                    violent opponents of Makarios. Not people you would call crazies, but they
                    certainly weren't people you would call ministers either. They just were put in
                    these jobs by the National Guard or the EOKA-B gang on the island. And they all
                    disappeared as far as I know without prejudice after the violence that followed,
                    maybe they fled the island because they certainly didn't have much future on the
                    Greek Cypriot side after all that happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned you had had some contact with Sampson during
                        the period that the embassy was curious about EOKA-B. Did you see him in the
                        subsequent period, or...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, after the Greek coup I never saw Sampson again. Earlier, I used to
                    call on him fairly regularly. He was at the time the publisher of Mahi which was
                    the Fox journalism if you will of Greek Cyprus at the time. It wasn't the most
                    right wing, but it was sensationalist. He was one of my regular contacts, just
                    as Nikos Koschish put out Agon, another right wing paper. There were lots of
                    right wing papers on the island, all of which more or less opposed Makarios'
                    policy. Makarios as a person, but not necessarily all of his policies. Sampson
                    would usually be sitting at a huge desk when you went into his office with
                    shelves that were lined with newspapers and magazines and books. I doubt he'd
                    read many of them. But quite often, and I'm not joking, he would be looking at
                    the centerfold of a Playboy magazine when you came in. I don't know if this was
                    for my benefit as an American diplomat, or if that was his standard reading
                    material. But he was totally unembarrassed about it, put it to the side, and
                    then would talk rather freely about how he saw the political development within
                    the Greek Cypriot community, or within Cyprus. All my contacts with Sampson were
                    before the coup of July of '74 and none of them discussed the possibility of a
                    coup nor of his involvement in it, so I was somewhat surprised when he was
                    installed in that job. Even in the privacy of his office his hatred of Turkish
                    Cypriots and his extreme Greek nationalism was quite manifest as it was in his
                    speeches on the floor of the house which I used to listen to. Interestingly
                    about Sampson is he had no formal education, poor fellow died a couple years
                    ago, and his pronunciation of Greek would often be corrected by other Greeks in
                    the house chamber, Savavache who would correct his emphasis or his choice of
                    wording. So their contempt for his education was fairly clear.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was probably good Greek language practice for you to go
                        to the debates and hear that discussion and recognize different
                        dialects.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It was eye opening and totally uncompromising. The Greek Cypriots when
                    they're speaking Greek for the record, as on the floor of the House, used in
                    those days a fairly florid form of the language. Katharevousa only begins to
                    capture what it was. It was tough going for somebody who'd had only 10 months at
                    that point of training and had been on the island for about a year. You could
                    eventually pick it up, but it was by no means simple, as easy to follow as the
                    Greek that's now used in Greece. I think too in Cyprus, although I don't know
                    how the minutes of the house were recorded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To what extent were you following, this is the period well
                        before the coup in July. To what extent were you following the dialogue that
                        was taking place between the Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot
                        communities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Very closely. Both Mike and I followed that as did the embassy. We
                    would meet regularly with the UN (United Nations) Secretary General's special
                    representative that was Osorio Tafafl for a long while and then it was somebody
                    else. Usually Latin American diplomats with various supporting cast in the UN
                    office and we would talk with the interlocutors Grays and Degtosh were their
                    deputies, fairly regularly. All of us did. That was one of the main substantive
                    focuses of the embassy's efforts in those years. The dialogue, what it was
                    doing, when it would resume, why it would quit, getting the dialogue going,
                    discussing the content of it was a big part of what we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the sense that they had made considerable
                        progress in the period shortly before the coup, or do you remember much
                        about the status at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I don't remember the details, but my sense is they had made
                    considerable progress on a lot of the technical issues of government before the
                    coup. It appeared that before my arrival on the island they had covered a lot of
                    the ground in a very productive way. A lot of issues involving local government,
                    the villages, labors, and the responses the federal government had been I
                    thought concluded successfully.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the issues about this period when you were there
                        that comes up occasionally is whether the United States had clear warning of
                        the plotting that was going on to stage a coup d'etat and whether we chose
                        perhaps not to do anything about it. And I've heard the suggestion fairly
                        recently that the embassy in Athens didn't want to act on these warnings for
                        various reasons including crying wolf too often. There had been a lot of
                        talk in the air for a long period of time why at that time say in June or
                        early July of '74 it didn't seem to them that much more imminent than any
                        other time. And that the embassy in Nicosia was kind of comfortable with
                        that posture at least in part because there was a feeling that if there was
                        going to be a coup the most logical time I think was projected to be
                        September of '74 when there would be a normal rotation of the Greek officers
                        of the Cyprus national guard and that if that would be kind of a time when
                        they could perhaps kick the old cadre and bring new people at the same time
                        and they would have a considerably greater strength. Do you remember
                        anything about all of that that makes any sense particularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I'm sure speculation of something like the troop rotation period was in
                    our reporting both with the guard on the Turkish side which also rotated troops
                    as well as with the Greek side. It's quite possible, although I don't remember
                    it now, that we did predict that September would be a more likely time for a
                    coup because of the rotation of the Greek contingent of that time. But all of
                    what was happening in early '74 came against the background of several years of
                    violence and sometimes alarmist reporting by embassy Nicosia about what had
                    happened, what EOKA-B had done, what Grivas had done. It may well be that the
                    cumulative effect of that was to make it more difficult for the policy makers to
                    see what was really changing, what had really changed with the departure of
                    Papadopoulos and the advent of Ioannidis. I don't recall a significant
                    ratcheting up of the violence. I can't recall the episodes post-November of '73,
                    but in retrospect it's very clear that there was a shift to a harder line in
                    Athens and therefore on the part of the National Guard and the EOKA-B on the
                    island after Ioannidis took over. I can't say for sure whether we yelled wolf
                    too much or not. I do know there was some ominous comments. Every time you sent
                    one of these cables in that reported a police station or a mailbox had been
                    blown up you'd have a final paragraph as a comment, this is a typical reporting
                    officer's trick, and there were only so many comments you can make on this type
                    of stuff. After a period of time the reader's eyes begin to glaze over. I think
                    for a while that if you look at the chron files of Nicosia, go into the office
                    of southern European affairs and took at the chron files of Nicosia versus the
                    chron files of Athens, Nicosia's chron files were surprisingly larger in some
                    respects in that period because of all this incidental reporting which in
                    retrospect may not have contributed too much to the overall understanding in
                    Washington of what was going on in the island, this chaff. I know there was a
                    strong sense that our Ambassador Tasca in Athens was reluctant to get involved
                    more with General Ioannidis than he already did, partly because of Ioannidis'
                    position. He was in the background with his formal title of chief of military
                    intelligence and Tasca was perhaps apocryphally saying I don't deal with cops,
                    but for whatever reason there was this reluctance. And there was no smoking gun
                    that I know of, or heard about, suggesting a coup was imminent until it really
                    happened. We were so used to this constant peppering of violence by EOKA-B and
                    so we didn't anticipate something big was coming until it really happened. I
                    don't recall anybody predicting that in a timely way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You don't remember embassy Nicosia pressing hard in that
                        particular period that something needed to be done?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I'm sure we pressed. I can't remember the specifics but I'm sure we
                    pressed and when Rodger got there we probably continued pressing to have
                    Washington lean harder on Greece to knock it off, because as far as we were
                    concerned the only way to turn off greater violence was to persuade the junta in
                    Athens to step down or step back. There was nothing we could do to Makarios that
                    would reduce the scenario of great violence on the island. We certainly weren't
                    going to counsel him to capitulate to what the junta was asking, and he didn't
                    have in his own power the capability to turn it off. Athens did. And we always
                    felt that, and I know we made recommendations, there was one notable cable that
                    went out soon after Rodger got there making this comment that we really need to
                    get Athens to step back or call off the dogs or tone it down, words to that
                    effect. We didn't know what we were asking for concretely except that the
                    tensions were getting a little higher. This was after the publication by
                    Makarios of those letters which I remember using the phrase Makarios was
                    challenging the self-esteem of Gizikis and by extension of Ioannidis by slapping
                    them in the face by the publication of these letters. And to do that to assail
                    the honor of these people that way, especially military people, is high stakes
                    poker.</p>

                </p>

                    and...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you meet with Makarios yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes. Not privately of course. I only met him with a larger group twice.
                    Once was when Rodger Davies presented credentials. I was introduced to him and I
                    said in my best Katharevousa Greek, “Calimera makadiotata,” which means good day
                    your beatitude. And he'd been chatting in English with the American staff up
                    till then. Rodger introduced us seriatim and I was about the fifth or sixth and
                    he brightened and smiled and said, “Calimerasas”. I saw him one other time at a
                    ladies' function as I recall where I was just there as an observer. My wife was
                    with a ladies' group and they were doing something and he was going down and
                    talking to the ladies. He liked ladies as is well known, and he was as well
                    known truly charismatic. There was something about his personality; he had the
                    eyes, just the smarts that made him quite special.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were certainly times during the 1960s particularly
                        where American officials were a little tired of Makarios and thought he was
                        going to be the Cuba of the Mediterranean and so on. At the time, the first
                        year you were there, the embassy got along well with him and whatever
                        attitude changed somewhat would you say? That had existed previously.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I never saw any of that attitude at the embassy in Nicosia. I remember
                    it though, as I said earlier, the phrase Red Mack. He was perceived by some
                    quarters as the Castro of the Mediterranean who dallied with socialists and
                    third world types and Bandung countries and all that. And all of that's true,
                    but he was also a genuine nationalist and leader of his people and took that
                    role very, very seriously. I think the proposals that were made by us in the
                    sixties to solve the Cyprus crisis, one of them involved moving the Greek
                    Cypriots to the island of Chios or Samos as I recall. Totally misunderstood the
                    nature of Hellenism and of Cypriot Hellenism in particular. There's just no way
                    you can uproot a people that's been there millennia and make them feel happy. It
                    was a total nonstarter. We had good will. We wanted to solve the problem as we
                    saw which was a problem between our two NATO allies to keep them from going at
                    each other's throats, but some of those proposals in retrospect were not fully
                    baked. I was not there when Popper was there, but I read the chron file
                    including the notice with what I know of McCloskey who was there off and on for
                    his eight month tenure, with Lindsay when he was charg�, with Rodger Davies and
                    his very brief tenure, the relations with Makarios and his government were very
                    cordial. There was no badmouthing of the archbishop, will somebody rid me of
                    this priest. There was none of that stuff in the country team or anywhere else.
                    Perhaps that spirit had burned itself out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What of the themes of EOKA-B as it had been of EOKA in the
                        fifties was of course enosis, the union of Cyprus with Greece. To what
                        extent was that generally still supported in the Greek Cypriot political
                        establishment that you had contact with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Again, pre-July '74 there was profound support among many Greek
                    Cypriots for enosis. It went far beyond the graffiti. When I was there all the
                    walls were whitewashed and all the whitewash was defaced with usually blue
                    slogans saying “Enosisi Monelisis”, enosis the only solution. All these enosis
                    Greek Cyprus slogans were all over. Now a small group of people could do that
                    and no doubt did. But most of the Greek Cypriots that I talked to, former
                    supreme court justice Fasiliades, Nikos Sampson, Cochis, even Clerides, if you
                    asked them what they really wanted they would all say their first choice is
                    enosis. And the realism would come when you'd say well what's really feasible
                    here, and people like Clerides would say in those days, well we couldn't get it
                    in London or Zurich and even though that's still our desire, this is also the
                    public line of Makarios, we have to make this solution work. The London-Zurich
                    solution which created the independence of the Republic of Cyprus. The answer to
                    that from the right, and it was deeply felt, was that's a corrupt solution,
                    unacceptable, a disgrace to Hellenism, and wrong. And the church was profoundly
                    of that view, unanimously almost as far as I know it was unanimous. And almost
                    all the center and right wing politicians I dealt with. AKEL the communist party
                    was happy with the solution as it was. It was definitely not enosis in its
                    rhetoric back then, but nobody, even AKEL as I recall in those days, would
                    oppose enosis head on. It was an icon, a sacred thing for which people had
                    sacrificed blood and treasure very recently. It was just something you didn't
                    attack. But the commitment to it emotionally was real and profound, I thought.
                    And the fear of it by the Turkish Cypriots was no less real and profound.</p>

                        Cyprus the next time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>We were in the middle of your assignment as political officer in Nicosia. You had
                    had Greek language training before going to Cyprus, and that was a period from
                    '73 to '75, and I think about the part we left off was the coup that took place
                    against Archbishop Makarios on the 15th of July, 1974, a little over 30 years
                    ago. So do you want to pick up from there?</p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: As I recall it was early on a Monday morning when we had gathered for
                    our daily staff meeting to go over what the local press was saying about us,
                    about each other, about the Cyprus problem. We heard loud noises coming from the
                    direction of the presidential palace downtown which was across the road from the
                    foreign ministry. We quickly concluded things were seriously amiss down there
                    and shortly had confirmation that a coup by the National Guard was underway.
                    Needless to say we terminated our staff meeting and sent the first of several
                    immediate messages back to Washington alerting the department and others to the
                    fact that a coup was underway. We had followed for some time, and reported on,
                    the growing tensions between the archbishop, President Makarios, and the Greek
                    junta in Athens. It was essentially a civil war that started within the Greek
                    community, within the community of Hellenism I should say between the demands of
                    the Greek junta and the unwillingness of the democratically elected leader of
                    the Cypriot people to knuckle under to the increasing demands from Athens. We
                    had reported rather grimly the week before when Makarios sent his letter to
                    President Phaedon Gizikis of Greece and essentially threw down the gauntlet
                    saying he was a democratically elected of a historic people on the island of
                    Cyprus and was not going to be treated like a satrap of a junta. Publishing that
                    letter added insult to injury and we predicted at the time that would lead to
                    further escalation of the already tense relations between Athens and Nicosia.
                    Indeed it did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much evidence did you have right away of the Greek
                        army officers on the island of Cyprus involved with this, in support of this
                        coup?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: At the time, and to some extent that may still apply today, but
                    certainly at that time, the national guard was officered entirely by officers
                    sent from Athens and the commandant was seconded from the Greek army. So it was
                    inconceivable that any significant unit of the National Guard could do anything,
                    certainly like attacking the presidential palace, without the active leadership
                    of the Greek officers from Athens. So once we concluded that the National Guard
                    was involved in the attack on the presidential palace it was quite clear that
                    this was the Athens junta at work through its officer corps on the island. As I
                    recall the Greek brigade was also involved, the one that was stationed in under
                    the London-Zurich agreements. I think the radio changed hands fairly quickly
                    that morning, but within a few hours we had confirmation on the radio that the
                    National Guard had liberated the island from Archbishop Makarios. A claim that
                    was wildly inflated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a man named Nikos Sampson who I think you
                        mentioned before who turned out to be the nominal leader of the coup makers.
                        Did that become evident right away?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I think it was not until that evening, and my memory on the hours is a
                    bit fuzzy, but I think it was that evening, maybe even the next morning that
                    Sampson was installed on Cyprus in front of Cyprus TV cameras as the president
                    of Cyprus. I had known Sampson in the course of my political reporting duties in
                    the first year that I was on the island. He was at the time a publisher of a
                    rather sensationalist rag called Mahi which in Greek means “The Battle”. He had
                    been a hero of the EOKA struggle who had distinguished himself by shooting
                    British military and civilians in the back as I recall, and by also doing things
                    against Turkish Cypriots. So he was a proven thug with a violent past, no
                    particular education, I don't know where his money came from to buy Mahi, but it
                    didn't take much to buy a newspaper on Cyprus in those days. But because of his
                    reputation as a fierce Greek Cypriot nationalist, leader of the EOKA movement
                    and someone who had boasted of what he had done against Turkish Cypriots in
                    those earlier struggles installing Nikos Sampson as the president of Cyprus was
                    very much like waving a red flag in front of the Turkish bull.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what happened to Archbishop Makarios in this initial
                        period, and to what extent did you and the embassy have contact with
                        him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Well we had no contact with the archbishop that week, those first days
                    I should say. Ambassador Davies had seen the archbishop I believe in the
                    preceding week. He had only recently presented his credentials and I don't think
                    he had more than one other meeting with the archbishop before the coup occurred
                    on 15 July. What happened to the archbishop was he was a workaholic as always.
                    He had come down from his mountain retreat in the Troodos and was hard at work
                    in the presidential palace that morning. I think he was receiving a delegation
                    of boy scouts or scouts of some kind, and when the shooting started he hustled
                    them out of the palace and they were able to get out unscathed. Then as the
                    palace took heavier and heavier fire he was able to doff some of his garments of
                    office and walk out of the palace through a trench in the back that got him and
                    an aide off the property. They hailed a cab and were taken to Paphos as I
                    recall, which then was only about three hours drive from Nicosia. And in Paphos
                    they somehow established contact with the British who flew the archbishop and
                    his companion or companions down to Akrotiri I guess where he was safe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you mentioned the Turkish Cypriots in terms of their
                        reaction to what was transpiring. Did you have contact with them, the
                        embassy did, or what were they doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The Turkish Cypriots were not involved, at least directly, in the
                    ongoing struggle within the ranks of Cypriot Hellenism as we called it as
                    between the Greek junta and Archbishop Makarios and the Greek Cypriot community.
                    We had very good contacts and coverage through Mike Austrian my colleague who
                    was the Turkish language officer. Very active, very well-connected. I had a few
                    contacts, but I was the Greek language officer and pretty busy on the Greek
                    side. Mike was in touch through his embassy locals who worked in the office out
                    of northern Nicosia. By crossing the green line himself several times in those
                    first days he was able to stay in touch with the Turkish Cypriots just to
                    ascertain what they were doing, what their reaction was. Essentially they were
                    hunkering down, fearing the worst because it was a very violent struggle with
                    artillery, tracer bullets, this and that. But they were not taking part in the
                    fighting, nor were they, in Nicosia at least, the target of any Greek or Greek
                    Cypriot hostilities as far as I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned you were very busy on the Greek side. What
                        sorts of things were you doing in terms of contacts? Were you in touch with
                        Sampson and his people, or dealing with the Makarios government? What could
                        you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: When Makarios fled, first of all the junta tried to kill him, there was
                    no question they tried to kill him. The presidential palace was reduced to a
                    flaming ruin within a few hours of the frontal assault by the forces of the
                    national guard. But unfortunately, for the junta at least, it was not a complete
                    assault because they left the back escape hatch open and Makarios was able to
                    escape. We really had no contact with him.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that was intentional that they allowed him to
                        get out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I've heard that speculation. I've never believed it. I think it would
                    have been much easier to kill him because they hated him so much. And as it was,
                    if they had let him go deliberately they should have known they were going to
                    create a martyr situation for themselves and a rallying point against them which
                    is what happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it may have been a matter of inefficiency, just not
                        total coverage?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I think it was inefficiency. He was quick, he was very agile, and he
                    was very lucky. He had more than nine lives I think. Makarios had tremendous
                    luck and by chance found a cab that was willing to take him to Paphos as he came
                    out of the escape hatch behind the palace. I have to say I never saw that trench
                    or that escape hatch. I didn't even know it was there because that was not
                    something of which I would have been aware normally. But obviously he did. So as
                    I say I think the junta definitely tried to kill him. Once Makarios was gone,
                    the junta initially announced over the radio that he was dead, “Makarios ina
                    necrosa,” I remember that rhythmic announcement every hour on the hour for a day
                    and a half or so, until it was conclusively proven by his own broadcast either
                    from Paphos or Akrotiri, it must have been from Paphos, that he was not dead.
                    And then they had to retract that statement, but they had then deposed his
                    government. The ministers stopped coming to the office, but the bureaucracy
                    stayed in place. So essentially my contacts in the foreign office and elsewhere
                    remained. Some of them went to work and I saw some of them. Just as a humorous
                    aside I should say the question of recognition of this Sampson government didn't
                    really arise immediately from Washington. It was a very short-lived government
                    in any case. I don't know what Washington was doing, but for us, for me and for
                    Mike Austrian, my colleague, the issue was we had a bunch of contacts below the
                    political level which had fled; the contacts were still in place, so why not see
                    them. And Mike and I went down to see a colleague of ours in the foreign
                    ministry, Costas Pilovakios who had been the regular career diplomat in charge
                    of the so-called Cyprus problem in dealing with western diplomats. We simply
                    went down to see Costas and I remember walking over the thousands and thousands
                    of shell casings that the national guard had expended in shooting its way
                    through the gates of the presidential palace and around the foreign ministry
                    which had been heavily fortified by Makarios defenders. In any case, walking
                    over with our shell casings, seeing the pock marks in the foreign ministry
                    building, I think the presidential palace was still smoldering, but Costas
                    Pilovakios was there in his office sipping coffee and looking very normal. So we
                    went in for a chat just to tell him we were glad he was ok, to discuss what had
                    happened from his perspective. Then we went back and we were roughly chastised
                    by the deputy chief of mission, Lindsay Grant, who thought we had committed a
                    grievous sin of implicitly conveying recognition of the new government by
                    talking to Costas. To be fair, Lindsay had a point; he was a China hand with a
                    deep background in the nuances of recognition and non-recognition policy. And we
                    had received no authorization from the embassy or Lindsay or certainly not from
                    Washington to talk to Costas. But we took the chastisement to heart and did not
                    see Costas again until as I recall the Sampson government was deposed, or
                    quit.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the embassy either Ambassador Davies or the DCM
                        Lindsay Grant or you or Mike Austrian have contact with the new ministers?
                        The Sampson appointed cabinet?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The ministers were announced very quickly after Sampson was installed
                    in that ceremony on TV over which one of the defrocked bishops had presided,
                    Bishop Chitian I believe. That's another story. The ministers were essentially
                    unknown figures to us. We had no contact with them, certainly not at the
                    political level. Many of them came out of the EOKA two movement which had been
                    the sympathizers of the EOKA two movement. Many of them were businessmen. I
                    don't recall they'd ever been to a July Fourth party or any other large
                    function. And again in the absence of instructions or any counter-instructions,
                    I set about to meet some of these folks in the next few days by calling on them
                    in their office. Their offices were basically their private sector offices. They
                    hadn't moved into the ministries yet. They hadn't taken charge of anything
                    although they had been announced. As I say they seemed to be mainly from the
                    private sector, businessmen of some kind. Fierce nationalists, Greek
                    nationalists. EOKA enosis types. Hated Makarios. I'm not sure that their ties
                    with Sampson were that close, but like him they had been installed by the junta
                    for reasons that I never got into. So as far as I know the only contact, aside
                    from possible contacts the agency might have had with its considerable assets in
                    the south and the Greek Cypriot community, the only contact was the so-called
                    ministers of the short lived Sampson government was me, essentially through
                    courtesy calls on them in their office in the latter days of the week of July
                    15th.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Dimitriou. Let me amend what I said. He was in touch with his brother;
                    it was Nicos Dimitriou and Dimis Dimitriou. I think Dimis was the minister
                    wasn't he?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and Nicos was the ambassador in Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: And through his brother, Dimis established contact with various levels
                    in the State Department and I also think he talked directly with Ambassador
                    Davies as the foreign minister. We had known Dimis Dimitriou. I had not, but he
                    had been on our A-list I guess because of his status as a member of the
                    Dimitriou family and a businessman. We were in touch with him. But the other
                    ministers, at least the ones I met, have been ciphers before.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, just that they were professionals, young, strong nationalists. I
                    had no sense of any great managerial ability or any sense of being members of a
                    team. They had just been put into this job or had assumed this job after the
                    coup and frankly seemed a little bit at loss how to make the best of it. Because
                    as I say I did not call on any of them in the government offices but rather in
                    their homes or at their private offices.</p>

                <p>WILLIAMS: It is EOKA-B and I misspoke. It's EOKA-Beta, the second generation of

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you want to say anything more about the role of the
                        church in all of this, particularly in this period? Makarios was gone; he
                        was the leader of the Church of Cyprus as well as the president of
                        Cyprus.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: He was the elected leader, the ethnarch of the Church of Cyprus,
                    elected back in 1950 or '51 as I recall, and then subsequently elected several
                    times to be president of the new Republic of Cyprus. A democratic sanctioned
                    leader, definitely charismatic, highly intelligent, extremely lucky, sometimes a
                    bit too clever perhaps. But he definitely controlled the Church of Cyprus. When
                    I came to Cyprus in 1973, the church was in the middle of a schism. A number of
                    the more conservative bishops had either been suborned by or become true
                    believers in the role of Athens as the leader of Hellenism and they were trying
                    to topple Makarios from his position as leader of the church. They convened a
                    synod which under the rules of the Greek Orthodox Church they were able to do,
                    and defrocked Makarios. This happened in the first half of '73 as I recall,
                    before I got there. Makarios, not to be outdone, convened his own synod under
                    the same rules and defrocked the three archbishops. These were Bishop Anthemos
                    of Kition, Bishop Kyprianos of Kyrenia, and Bishop Gennadios of Paphos.
                    Essentially he outmaneuvered these guys using their own rules, which were his
                    rules. He was a member of the same church, and he had the better of it. It was
                    quite a test of my FSI taught Greek to go through essentially ecclesiastical
                    legalese and these documents where one side excommunicated the other. It was
                    very clear, but I needed a lot of help to get through the translation. But the
                    Greek Cypriot Orthodox church was clearly in the hands of Makarios after this
                    happened. These three defrocked bishops remained defrocked, they had some local
                    following, but no significant following among the archimandrites and abbots and
                    others who led the church. Makarios ran the church as he ran the government,
                    very effectively, and tolerated no opposition, certainly not opposition from
                    leaders who were actually doing the work of the junta in Athens. So I don't
                    recall what those defrocked bishops said if anything at the time of the coup.
                    Certainly they would have had to welcome it since this was the national center
                    by their lights acting against an archbishop whom they had tried to defrock. And
                    I don't recall anything that the leaders of the Greek Cypriot Orthodox Church
                    said in support of Makarios, but probably there were expressions from the pulpit
                    and elsewhere since he had tremendous support among the Greek Cypriot
                    people.</p>

                        from July 15th? Succeeding few days, about the American community, about
                        your families, about the embassy, to the extent you were involved with
                        things related to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Naturally we were all concerned because for several days in Nicosia and
                    elsewhere on the island there was active fighting. We used to watch the tracer
                    bullets at night from the balcony of our apartment which was just a few blocks
                    from the embassy. We certainly took precautions by advising people to stay
                    inside, curtail their outside activities, and just to keep their heads down. I
                    think we only had one casualty in the American community and that was
                    accidental, where a piece of shrapnel from one of those missiles I guess wounded
                    a young girl in the leg or the chest. It was not a life-threatening injury, but
                    it was a serious one, and she was taken care of in the Nicosia hospital and then
                    sent down to Akrotiri where the British had better facilities and also a more
                    secure location. We were of course concerned for our families, but in the time
                    before the Turkish intervention I don't recall that any of the families left the
                    island although we certainly realized that was a real prospect that grew more
                    imminent each day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Turkish invasion took place on the 20th of July but
                        presumably in the days before that there was fear that that was going to
                        happen. Well-founded fear. Do you want to talk anything about that as far as
                        you were involved? I know the State Department was doing various things, but
                        I don't know to what extent you were involved on the island.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: We were increasingly concerned with the installation of Sampson as the
                    president of Cyprus by the Athens junta through the idea that the Turkish
                    government would have to respond militarily to what it viewed as such a
                    provocation. I think we said that in a number of cables back to Washington
                    trying to lay it out that we had to really pull out all the stops to try to stop
                    the Turkish invasion from happening. Joe Sisco was engaged actively in trying to
                    do that as was the Secretary of State. Tom Boyatt said at one point, he may have
                    said it to me in fact in the years nearly after this, that the embassy had not
                    made a strong enough case in Washington with its cables to help him fight the
                    fight in Washington. And he may be right. I can't recall what those cables
                    said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that before the coup, or between the coup and the

                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, I think it was the whole thing but it was also before the coup and
                    after the coup before the invasion and then before the second phase too. I think
                    Tom felt, and he was the very embattled and very diligent country director of
                    Cyprus at the time, he just felt he had not gotten at critical times enough
                    ammunition from the embassy. And I respect his point of view. I can't say
                    whether it was right or wrong because I didn't have the Washington perspective
                    at the time. We were trying to keep tabs on a lot of things. We talked about the
                    concern for the families, the growing indications of a Turkish invasion,
                    preparations by the junta and its national guard to defend against that
                    invasion, and we wanted to make sure that Americans were hunkered down and not
                    caught in the middle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To what extent in those few days between the coup and the
                        invasion were there incidents of violence by Greek Cypriots directed at
                        Turkish Cypriots? And to what extent did you know about that at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: There were a lot of rumors going around as always happens in Cyprus and
                    the media and the press on both sides in both communities tended to fan those
                    flames of depredations by the Greek Cypriots and Greeks against the Turkish
                    Cypriot side and to some extent vice versa. I do not recall hearing of a
                    specific case during that week. I do recall hearing after all this happened in
                    the summer of '74 that the National Guard units outside of Nicosia had encircled
                    several Turkish Cypriot enclaves. At the time, of course, the Turkish Cypriots
                    were not concentrated in the northern part of the island as they are now. They
                    were scattered in enclaves all over the island in the large cities such as
                    Famagusta, Morphou, Paphos, Nicosia, Larnaca and so forth. Some of those had
                    enclaves as they were called had been hotbeds of resistance by the Turkish
                    fighters, the TMT and other groups, during the earlier phases of the Cyprus
                    struggle. The Cyprus problem. And some of those areas were, according to several
                    reports I heard, from pretty good sources, encircled by the National Guard in
                    that first week. That would have been a prudential step to take by any armed
                    force under the circumstances, even though the Turkish Cypriots had not been
                    involved in the coup. Given the past history on the island of military fighting
                    between the two communities that would have been a prudential step to take.
                    Whether or not the National Guard went further than that, I do not know. I never
                    heard of such a case.</p>

                <p>WILLIAMS: Not at all. My attention was elsewhere. I don't recall that Mike
                    Austrian who covered that community as well as anybody on the island, reported
                    it. I just don't remember.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Well, it was a wild and I have to say exciting time. As a young
                    diplomat I had never been involved in a coup before, or at least been spectator
                    of a coup. I certainly wasn't involved in it. And I found reporting on it and
                    moving around as we were able to do quite freely in Nicosia to be exhilarating.
                    In retrospect some of that movement was probably a little foolhardy. It
                    certainly was riskier than at the time I was willing to accept. But it was an
                    exhilarating time and I enjoyed every minute of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The United Nations peacekeeping force was on the island,
                        I'm wondering to what extent you had contact with them, you and
                        representatives, other diplomats, or was that pretty much done by the
                        ambassador and DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Well we all did. UNFICYP as it was called, the UN forces in Cyprus, was
                    blanketed by the embassies of America, Britain, a few others as well. I had
                    regular contacts in the UNFICYP civilian side. Our defense attach� knew their
                    military side. The ambassador and DCM knew the special representative of the
                    secretary general who at the time I think was Osorio Tafall. It may have been
                    somebody else. But one of the representatives was in contact with our
                    ambassador. But UNFICYP had no mandate to intervene in this kind of situation,
                    and studiously and successfully tried to avoid having its units which were
                    deployed all over the island get involved in any of the fighting.</p>

                <p>WILLIAMS: I had regular contacts with the British high commission, yes, not the
                    SPAs or others. From the first day I got there it was clear to me and I'd been
                    so advised by others that the British high commission knew more about what was
                    going on in the island than probably anybody. My counterpart initially was David
                    Beattie who went on to a very distinguished career in the British foreign
                    service. He had been a classicist at Oxford or Cambridge, understood the Greeks,
                    the Greek Cypriots, the British role in Cyprus, and was a wonderful source of
                    information and support for me as I was getting my legs on the ground that first
                    year. I also was a personal and professional colleague with Derek Day who also
                    had a very distinguished career. Derek was the deputy high commissioner of the
                    British high commission. So we were in close touch with them as to what was
                    going on, what might happen, what we could do to head off a Turkish military
                    response to the Greek coup of July 15th.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well that response came on the 20th of July, five days or
                        so later. What do you remember about that from your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I remember it vividly. At the time, I was living and working in my
                    office which was part of the complex that also contained the ambassador's
                    residence. Our families had not yet been evacuated, my family, my wife Ann was
                    pregnant at the time and threatening to miscarry. She was confined to bed at
                    home. I was in constant touch with my family by phone, by walkie talkie and by
                    walking down to see them. But most of my waking time and all of my sleeping time
                    I spent those last few days in my office. And around 4:30 that morning of July
                    20, before first light, I got a call from Derek Day, the British deputy high
                    commissioner who told me that Turkish Prime Minister Ecevit had just informed
                    the British as co-guarantors of the London-Zurich Accords that the Turkish
                    government was going to send a military force to Cyprus to undo what the Greek
                    junta had done on July 15. It was quite clear and Derek's message did not
                    require elaboration. The Turks were on the way is what it said. And when first
                    light came about thirty minutes later the planes started coming overhead, we saw
                    paratroops dropping, we heard antiaircraft fire, and we knew that the invasion
                    was underway. We got our telegram message out soon after that phone call. Of
                    course I informed the ambassador. We stayed of course in very close touch with
                    the British embassy by phone because it was not safe to go out while the
                    fighting was going on. I remember seeing all those parachutes coming down; it
                    was like watching butterflies descend. Quite surreal. I'd never seen something
                    like that before. Once in a while you'd see a parachute collapse and its
                    occupant fall like a stone to the ground and you knew what had happened, but
                    again it was just as if I was detached from it, watching it on a large,
                    wide-angle screen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that particularly happening on the north side of
                        Nicosia, the Turkish border?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The Turkish enclave of Nicosia was in the north and it sort of went up
                    like a triangle toward the Kyrenia range, extended into the Kyrenia range as I
                    recall, blocking the then only road over the Kyrenia range. One of the first
                    concerns of the Turkish military was to strengthen the Turkish Cypriot presence,
                    military capability in that enclave. So they paradropped a number of folks in
                    while they were in the process of establishing a beach head on the northern
                    shore at Kyrenia which was sort of due north from Nicosia. Needless to say, when
                    that happened the fighting started early that morning, went on for several days.
                    We had a number of people at our FBIS (Foreign Broadcast Information Service)
                    station with their families who were caught smack dab in the middle on the north
                    coast, west of Kyrenia as I recall. They were either at Karavas in their houses
                    up on the beach in their beach houses. By the grace of God they all survived.
                    Scared to death in many cases, especially the children. We were able to get them
                    out during one of the ceasefires or lulls in fighting under UN convoy in the
                    next few days. But it was a harrowing time for them and for those of us who knew
                    about them in Nicosia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were taken from Karavas to Nicosia or to an airport
                        to fly out or how did...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I don't recall how they immediately went. We got them down first to
                    Nicosia and made sure they were alright and put them in some kind of housing. Of
                    course we had plenty of room for them in various houses. I think most of them
                    were evacuated as soon as it was practical to do so. Probably from Akrotiri.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we talk for a minute just about the evacuation.
                        Your family went then too. How soon after July 20th was that possible?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The fighting essentially was over in the north about the 23rd or 24th
                    as I recall. Since we had profound reasons to believe that was simply a lull,
                    that it would break out again any time, we decided to conduct a general
                    evacuation. I think it was ordered from Washington, I don't recall specifically.
                    There were Americans all over the island, but essentially most of them were in
                    Nicosia. By this point, late that first week of the invasion, we had gathered
                    many of them in Nicosia from the northern shore. There were retired Americans up
                    there. Most of the Americans up north were not hurt as I recall, just scared out
                    of their wits and we got them all down to Nicosia. At the same time we gathered
                    Americans from elsewhere, archaeologists who were working in Kyrenia or
                    elsewhere, their families. And we organized what I would describe in a letter to
                    Dana Davies as a wagon train of cars and various vehicles that gathered at the
                    American embassy on the 24th, 25th I don't remember exactly, of July. With UN
                    escort the convoy drove down on the old road to Akrotiri from which they were
                    going to be taken off to the waiting U.S. ships offshore and evacuated. That
                    went very smoothly. As I say the fighting had stopped at least over Nicosia by
                    this point. The Americans were not harassed; the Greek Cypriots still reeling
                    from the shock of what had happened had not focused on the Americans or the
                    foreigners. Primarily Americans, but also some other foreigners were in that
                    convoy. But the Greek Cypriots were benign or indifferent. They had their own
                    concerns. Many evacuees said they spent a miserable night on a sandfly-infested
                    beach in Akrotiri before they got on the offshore vessel, but that was a small
                    price to pay. My wife and son did not evacuate because of Ann's medical
                    condition. As I said earlier she was about to miscarry, her gynecologist or
                    obstetrician made the case quite convincingly that she was certainly going to
                    miscarry if she was subjected to the rigors of a rough trip down to Akrotiri and
                    staying on the beach. So with great reluctance Ambassador Davies agreed that Ann
                    and Ben could stay behind, but on condition that they move into the residence
                    where his staff could better take care of them. He just did not want to have
                    them staying in the house we had after the evacuation occurred.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The ambassador's residence then and later was essentially
                        an apartment above the offices, but above the chancery, in the
                        compound.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Within the compound, within the secure perimeter. Ann and Ben, who was
                    four at the time, moved in. They had a nice little guest room in the residence.
                    I was able to go see them every so often because I could walk up the stairs or
                    take the elevator up. The elevator was kind of cranky, sometimes it worked,
                    sometimes it didn't. I was young and able to take the stairs pretty quickly, it
                    was about a five floor walkup as I recall. It was a big adventure for Ben. He
                    was a four year old and he brought his bow and arrow with him and he was
                    shooting at the planes that flew over, and for him it was a great adventure. Ann
                    was confined to bed largely because of her medical condition, and was not happy
                    about having to leave her house and her maid and all her stuff, but she
                    recognized the wisdom of Rodger's decision and her own potential vulnerability
                    in the house.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was essentially the only American family member that
                        stayed, or were there a few others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: There may have been others. I think everybody else's family in the
                    embassy at least, of the official community left by the time that convoy went
                    south. Some may have gone before. But I think Ann and Ben were virtually the
                    only members of that community who stayed behind after July 24.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else about the evacuation of the others? Were you
                        involved with that or did the administrative officer handle it pretty
                        much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The others in the embassy, particularly the administrative officer, I
                    guess that was Eddie Edwards, handled the logistics. Red Jessup the defense and
                    army attach� handled the liaison with UNFICYP and with the Greek National Guard.
                    Red had very good contacts throughout the military establishment of Cyprus.
                    Turkish, Greek, Greek Cypriot, Turkish Cypriot, so forth. So others in the
                    embassy did the liaison, did the organization. I was essentially a spectator
                    saying goodbye to a lot of good friends whom I didn't expect to see again for a
                    long while. Many of those folks went to Beirut which at the time was our safe
                    haven. I guess almost all of them went to Beirut, at least initially. And then
                    from there the expectation was that they would be able to come back to Cyprus
                    fairly soon. That expectation did not pan out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The coup collapsed. Do you want to talk about that and how
                        quickly that happened and to what extent you were involved with the Greek
                        Cypriots who were involved on both sides?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The Sampson government just evaporated shortly after the Turkish
                    invasion of July 20. I never saw again any of those civilian ministers on whom I
                    had called the previous week. I don't think any of them, except perhaps the
                    defense minister, had any role in defending the island against the Turkish
                    forces that were invading. So essentially the Sampson government was a one week
                    wonder. It came by the grace of the National Guard and Athens junta and it fell
                    and departed just about as quickly. But the military side was another matter.
                    That was well-organized. The National Guard, Greek officers, had fortified the
                    northern part of the island to a fare-thee-well against the day when the Turks
                    did come down in force. The Turks in the earlier phases of the Cypriot problem
                    invaded somewhat with midnight landings, some overflights, some napalm in the
                    early '60s and '64 I think. But the Greek Cypriots, and for that matter Athens
                    knew that if the problem went on there was a high likelihood that the Turks
                    would come in force. Against that contingency they had pillboxes well dug in and
                    they were fierce fighters and they fought very well even though the Sampson
                    government had disappeared. The military chain of command held and acquitted
                    itself I'm told very well. Certainly the fighting was fierce and protracted for
                    several days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Essentially it was all over by about the 24th of
                        July?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The ceasefire was arranged by UNFICYP by that point. I think both sides
                    were fairly worn out; the Greek Cypriots had killed a lot of Turks but had given
                    up terrain in the north. Essentially the triangle that goes out from Nicosia to
                    the northern shore on two sides. A lot of Greek Cypriots were becoming refugees
                    in their own country and, Makarios liked to say, were fleeing the area for good
                    reason. And the Turks having established several beachheads needed to
                    consolidate their gain. So both sides had an interest in stopping the fighting.
                    UNFICYP was material I think in arranging it. I think the diplomacy that we did,
                    the British did with the Turks and Greeks also helped facilitate that, so I
                    don't know when the ceasefire started. Probably about the 25th or 26th of July.
                    Fighting stopped, but the refugees continued to move out of that area that the
                    Turkish army was in the process of occupying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't you go back to something you've said a couple of
                        times. You called on several of the civilian ministers of the Nikos Sampson
                        government after the coup. All the ministers? Two or three? Do you remember
                        roughly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: There were only a few days to do this. I didn't know that at the time
                    of course, and I was not trying to do every one of them in a short period of
                    time, but I think I called probably on six, maybe seven. Not all of them. It was
                    a full cabinet. They replaced every one as I recall of Makarios' ministers with
                    their own person. I don't believe I called on all of them, that was my intention
                    certainly.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After July 20th as you say the coup kind of disappeared
                        and those ministers were gone. Makarios was also gone. Do you want to talk
                        about what happened and your experience with that part?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Makarios had been flown off the island by the British from their
                    sovereign base area in Akrotiri to London a day or two after he had escaped from
                    Nicosia, gone to Paphos and then come down to Akrotiri. There was the illegal
                    government of Nikos Sampson installed by the junta which collapsed then soon
                    after the invasion of July 20. And then the Cypriot constitution came into play.
                    Glafkos Clerides who was the president of the house of representatives, very
                    distinguished politician, lawyer, member of a very well-regarded family on the
                    island, trained at the Inns of Court in London and so forth, by virtue of the
                    constitution became the acting president of Cyprus in the absence of the
                    archbishop. This was standard practice whenever the archbishop went overseas on
                    a trip which he often did. Makarios liked to travel as president. Whenever the
                    archbishop left the island, the president of the House of Representatives which
                    was usually Clerides in those days became automatically the acting president
                    with full powers until the archbishop returned. And this was the mechanism by
                    which Clerides ascended to the presidency in the week of July 20; I don't recall
                    exactly what day it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did Clerides then return the ministers that had served
                        Makarios to office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I believe the whole Makarios cabinet came back. Clerides had one or two
                    very close associates he brought with him into the presidency because none of us
                    knew at the time. The only significant contact whom I recall Clerides brought
                    into office with him this time in contrast to what he had done before was
                    Critolovas Cristoluhu who had been for years the head of the government printing
                    office and an old EOKA fighter as well. Young man, but he'd been an EOKA fighter
                    in the old days. The original EOKA. And a very, very close friend as he is today
                    of Glafkos Clerides. Cris whom I knew well from my own contacts first year moved
                    into the office with Clerides. They couldn't work out of the presidential palace
                    because it was a smoking ruin, or by this time just a ruin, so they worked out
                    of the PIO's office where Cristoluhu was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you saw him frequently in this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I saw Cris or talked to him almost every day. We were on a first name
                    basis as happens often with Greeks and Greek Cypriots. It's not hard. He was
                    very bright, very responsive, very close to Clerides. I'd say I had as good a
                    conduit to the presidency as anybody in the embassy, except perhaps the
                    ambassador at that time. And the ambassador of course saw and talked with
                    Clerides as often as he needed to, bearing in mind that Clerides had his hands
                    full with the demands of the growing refugee population, uncertainties of a
                    breakout, what would occur, how it could be prevented, and the effort to
                    consolidate or to reestablish a stable system on the island.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say a breakout you mean the Turks going beyond
                        this initial wedge they had established from Nicosia to the north
                        coast.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The terms of the ceasefire as negotiated by UNFICYP called for a
                    stabilization of the perimeter that the Turkish forces had established and no
                    material change in the military situation of either side. The hope was to
                    prevent the Turks from upgrading their capabilities, bringing in more material,
                    and to keep the Greek side from doing the same on its part of the island.
                    Needless to say that hope was in vain. The Turks wanted the breathing space the
                    ceasefire offered in large part in order to restock their supplies and to build
                    up for the next phase of a military operation, what the military calls a
                    breakout. And there was a constant stream of reports from the embassy, from Mike
                    Austrian who covered it somewhat from the civilian side, from Red Jessup who
                    covered it on the military side, from UNFICYP and others, and screams of protest
                    from the Greeks and the Greek Cypriots about the very blatant military buildup
                    the Turks conducted through the port of Kyrenia for the next few weeks after the
                    ceasefire went into effect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude toward the United States in this
                        period? How did you feel about it in the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I don't think any of us at the time received a particular threat
                    because of local feelings about America. There was always the view that the
                    United States could stop Turkey if it wanted to. We had unwittingly reinforced
                    that view by successfully stopping Turkey from invading Cyprus a number of
                    times. We had the Johnson letter in 1964 when we told the Turkish government of
                    Ismet Inonu if you get your ass in a crack with the Soviet Union by virtue of
                    invading Cyprus, don't expect NATO to bail you out. It succeeded but the Turks
                    never forgave us or forgot that letter. In 1967 we did it again when President
                    Johnson sent Cyrus Vance to mediate between Turkey and Greece over a possible
                    war that was going to break out because of something the national guard had done
                    under Grivas, had done against the Turkish Cypriot villages in the south. In the
                    early 1970s we intervened less dramatically but still effectively behind the
                    scenes to try to calm some of the more dangerous aspects of the confrontation
                    between the junta and Makarios. So we had done a lot and the Greek Cypriots knew
                    that, and the Greeks knew that and the world knew that, to keep Turkey from
                    invading Cyprus. It was not unreasonable therefore for Greek Cypriots and Greeks
                    to expect in 1974 we would do the same thing. The fact that we were unable to do
                    it despite Joe Sisco's and Henry Kissinger's efforts led many Greek Cypriots,
                    and the irresponsible element especially, to conclude we hadn't tried hard
                    enough and really didn't want to stop the Turks this time. And so there was a
                    growing sentiment, although in the time of which we're speaking it wasn't yet
                    dangerous, that the Americans were ultimately responsible for this by virtue of
                    not having used the sixth fleet to interpose between Turkey and the island
                    therefore stopping the invasion. We saw that in the paper, we heard it
                    occasionally, but there were no demonstrations against us. Again, the Greek
                    Cypriots in this first period after the invasion on July 20 were so preoccupied,
                    understandably so, with their own concerns, their families, their properties,
                    the uncertainties, the tragedies. The deaths, the rapes, the lootings, this sort
                    of thing, that they really had not had time to focus on us. That came later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To what extent do you think in this early period was
                        Glafkos Clerides in touch with Rauf Denktash the Turkish Cypriot leader.
                        They had been the main negotiators in the period before the coup. I don't
                        know if we talked before about how close they were to reaching an agreement,
                        to what extent were you involved following that, or was that pretty much
                        being done by others in the embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Covered more by others than by me. I was somewhat involved because you
                    couldn't in those days serve in the embassy in Nicosia without having some role
                    in the Cyprus problem, in reporting. But no, they had come close a number of
                    times to agreeing on the basic elements of the settlement that would put the
                    Humpty Dumpty together again that had been created by the London-Zurich Accords.
                    According to Clerides' memoirs at least, most times they failed because Makarios
                    was just unwilling to make the leap of faith, to give up that much to the
                    Turkish Cypriot side for his own reasons which we can get into if you want.
                    Clerides and Denktash in those days had a healthy respect for each other. I
                    think they always did. They had been colleagues at the bar, Clerides had been a
                    defense attorney, Denktash had been Queen's Counsel. He had prosecuted, Clerides
                    had defended. They were on the opposite side of issues that came into the
                    British courts, but they knew each other as professionals and though of
                    different ethnicity they respected each other. I have seen Denktash, for
                    example, at receptions to which we used to invite them both before the coup, in
                    the good old days so-called, speak fluent Greek with Clerides. He grew up
                    speaking Greek as most Turkish Cypriots of his class did. I don't recall if
                    Clerides speaks Turkish. He certainly knows some. But they got along well, they
                    communicated well, even when the division came after '63. I don't remember
                    specifically, but I'm very certain that Clerides reached out to Denktash through
                    either intermediaries or phone call, or some way, after he became acting
                    president in July of '74. Simply to try to reestablish the contact, reassure
                    Denktash that he was going to do his best, and enlist Denktash's help in keeping
                    his own wild men if possible under control. I don't know the substance of what
                    they discussed, but I'm very certain that's what happened. With what effect I
                    don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Davies was very busy during this period with
                        Clerides?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Indeed he was. With Clerides, with organizing the evacuation of the
                    American community, at least presiding over it, and reassuring elements of the
                    American community. That summer we had, by virtue of a decision that emerged
                    from a long process in the intelligence community in Washington, civilianized a
                    large part of the NSA operations on the island. There were two stations near
                    Nicosia, Neomilia in the east and Yerolakkos in the north, both are now in the
                    Turkish zone of Cyprus. Those are well-known listening spots. NSA ran them with
                    military personnel for years. When I first got there they were naval personnel,
                    but for whatever reason the decision had been made, fatefully as it turned out,
                    to civilianize those operations early in the summer of 1974. So what we had was
                    a bunch of civilians and their families show up in June, July and they really
                    had not even gotten to their apartments or their houses when the lid blew off.
                    So they were particularly panicked. Most of these folks were not military, at
                    least not then, they had not served overseas, and they had not been briefed on
                    what might happen in Cyprus; they had no experience with evacuation. There was a
                    lot of panic, understandably, among some members of that community. Ambassador
                    Davies met a number of times with them trying to calm them down, to assure them
                    that an evacuation plan was in place and we would take care of them, they would
                    be protected. The girl who was injured, whom I mentioned on the last tape, was
                    in that community and Rodger spent a lot of time with that as well as talking to
                    the government in Cyprus and talking to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that community was evacuated pretty much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: All. And they never came back of course because the station ceased to
                    operate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the military, the navy operators had all left just
                        before that summer. Did some people see that as anticipation of what was
                        going to happen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I don't recall anybody saying that, nor do I recall reading it. I used
                    to read the Greek Cypriot press in all its turgid glory pretty carefully. I
                    don't remember that sort of thing. The numbers didn't change. In fact, if
                    anything, they may have increased because of all the dependents. We're talking
                    about a fairly large population that came in. I remember them in the pool at the
                    Hilton hotel. A lot of them, they were loud. Too American I thought. But very
                    clearly American, and looking forward to a very nice tour on an island in the
                    Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, well you'd been anticipating the second Turkish
                        invasion, Turkish breakout as it's called. Do you want to talk a little bit
                        more about the period leading up to that and what happened at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: As I recall there was a steady buildup of Turkish troops and material
                    in the beachhead that had been established which essentially linked the northern
                    part of the northern coast of Cyprus to the Turkish enclave in Nicosia. That
                    buildup continued fairly steadily for several weeks after the fighting stopped
                    with the first ceasefire. The refugee situation continued to grow because there
                    was a large Greek Cypriot population that had not been able to get out of that
                    area before the ceasefire went in place. Of course, many Greek Cypriots still
                    hoped that their citrus groves, their houses, their churches, their graveyards
                    would be spared, that they would get them back and so they didn't want to leave.
                    But as it became clear the Turkish buildup was relentless, more and more the
                    Greek Cypriots started leaving. There were depredations as well by the Turkish
                    troops. Some rapes. Desecration of church property and so on. Word of that got
                    around and of course it made the Greek Cypriot population even more nervous.
                    Those who were in the Karpas Peninsula, that long spit of land which is up
                    toward the Gulf of Iskenderun, knew that if there was a breakout and Turkish
                    troops moved east they would be likely cut off. So I think there was, even
                    before the second breakout started in August, a movement by some Greek Cypriots
                    in the Karpas Peninsula south, sort of preemptive evacuation lest they be cut
                    off. So there were a lot of folks on the roads, a lot of uncertainty that we had
                    to deal with, report on getting our own community out, which we did pretty much
                    by the time of the convoy south to Akrotiri. There was a lot of diplomacy going
                    on at this time in Geneva. We had the British convene the meeting of the
                    guarantor powers in Geneva. Art Hartman was there; I think Joe Sisco was there.
                    There was more shuttle diplomacy within Ankara and Athens trying to keep this
                    thing from getting worse. Makarios was in London in direct contact with
                    Clerides, with the Greek Diaspora.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At some point he came to New York.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: He did during the UN general assembly when there was a special debate.
                    I think that was definitely after August. He did indeed. He was active in making
                    statements against what the junta had done and then against what Turkey had
                    done. It was a real mishmash. We in the embassy were trying to keep up with
                    everything that was going on. But I think at the end of the day we really saw
                    that buildup as unstoppable and for us it was just a question of when the
                    breakout would occur. Red Jessup, the defense attach�, used to brief us
                    regularly at the staff meeting about how it would likely go. Both east and west,
                    because the lines as drawn in that ceasefire were not really tenable. Nor did
                    they, as we later confirmed, accord with the plans of the Turkish general staff
                    to establish a larger presence in the northern part of the island, contingency
                    plans for when the time came.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To what extent during this period between roughly July 25,
                        26 and the breakout in August, to what extent was there violence directed at
                        some of the Turkish Cyprian enclaves or villages that were well away from
                        this Turkish controlled area?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The National Guard as I mentioned earlier had ringed some of the
                    enclaves to prevent violence from the Turkish Cypriot side. There may have been
                    some concern about reprisals from the Greek Cypriot side. I don't know that to
                    be the case. But you heard more and more reports about it. I was not involved in
                    any of those. Mike Austrian covered them, but we stared getting more reports and
                    a lot of this was hearsay and rumor and magnification of hearsay and rumor.
                    Really I can't recall specifically whether we ever confirmed there was any
                    violence against the Turkish Cypriot enclaves outside the area of the Turkish
                    establishment by the ceasefire. But I can say a lot of Turkish Cypriots were
                    fearful of that, and I think there was a growing desire by some of the hotheads
                    in the Greek Cypriot community for reprisals given what had been done to
                    Hellenism, to their properties in the north.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So why don't we come forward to the second Turkish
                        intervention. That was on August 14.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It did not have for me the drama of the first one, because it had been
                    so expected, much more so than the Turkish invasion of July 20th. Once the Turks
                    established the beachhead and the buildup started and continued despite all our
                    efforts to stop it, it was really just a question of when, and the when was we
                    thought rather imminent. I don't recall how I got the word on August 14.</p>
                <p>Somehow we got word, and I think the breakout occurred up north rather than in
                    Nicosia, so the first violence was not immediately visible from where we were in
                    the embassy. But it happened, it lasted a very short while, probably no longer
                    than the first phase because at this point the National Guard emplacements had
                    been destroyed. The National Guard had not had time to build new emplacements
                    surrounding the Turkish beachhead area established by the ceasefire, and as you
                    know it's essentially a plain on both directions east and west. So the Turkish
                    army had pretty easy going when it broke out in both directions. Many Greek
                    Cypriot refugees had started moving, really started moving after the second
                    phase began on August 14. There were huge numbers of refugees heading south,
                    including from Famagusta and Verosha, the suburb of Famagusta in the east, and
                    the Turkish army in some cases had to overcome local resistance which wasn't too
                    hard. In other cases they moved into a vacuum of an area that was not even
                    populated much less defended. So it was a fairly easy progression in military
                    terms at least for the Turkish army to take what was then the northern third of
                    the island.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At what point was Nicosia airport taken? Or at least made
                        inoperable.</hi>

                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Nicosia airport was rendered inoperable by the first invasion as I
                    recall. I don't think any planes came in and out of that airport after July 20,
                    mainly because the runways had been pitted. There were wrecks on them, planes
                    parked on runways had been destroyed by the Turkish jets. Stuff had fallen on
                    them; there were caverns and craters in the runways. So I think from that point
                    on the airport was not used as an airport. UNFICYP of course had a large
                    presence in the airport, including in the tower. They were able to watch a lot
                    of the fighting, the skirmishing in both the first phase and the second phase
                    from that vantage. But the only thing that flew out of the airport after July 20
                    was helicopters as far as I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the breakout August 14th the attitude shifted right
                        away toward the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: As I'd explained before there was a growing attitude that the United
                    States was ultimately responsible for this because it had not stopped Turkey
                    inasmuch as America had stopped Turkey before. It seemed quite clear to the
                    Greeks that it had chosen this time not to stop Turkey. This was the basic logic
                    that was used. It was not an illogical position, but it overlooked some of the
                    realities of what we were dealing with in Ankara at the time. And in Athens at
                    the time. When those huge swarms of refugees came south, these were numbers that
                    dwarfed what had come in the wake of the first invasion. I don't recall how many
                    Greek Cypriots were ultimately declared displaced persons in their own country,
                    or refugees in their own country as Makarios called them. Several hundred
                    thousand probably. A lot of them came to Nicosia and set up temporary camps
                    there with relatives, just in tents, whatever. It was a time of great
                    confusion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think they claimed 200,000, although that may have been
                        later on because some went...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: That could well be because they had 500,000 or more as the total
                    population and so that number could well be correct which is vast. It indicates
                    the size of the problem with which Clerides had to grapple in terms of taking
                    care of these people. It was almost too much for any government to handle. This
                    exodus of refugees or displaced persons or whatever you call them, concentrated
                    in and around Nicosia. The first inkling I had that we really could be in
                    trouble was when I went with the ambassador to see Clerides at the PIO office
                    which was the office Clerides had chosen since there was no other place to go.
                    The PIO office was a brick building on stilts as I recall. You parked under it.
                    And there were huge numbers of civilians, refugees I guess, milling around when
                    we drove up in the Cadillac with the flag flying. And they were not happy faces
                    when they saw the car and the flag and us. There were shaken fists and gestures;
                    I think one or two people hit the car. We had a police escort so we didn't think
                    we were in any danger. It was becoming a mob, and it was clearly not friendly.
                    So we got out, went in to see Clerides. I forget what the specific reason was
                    for that call. I think we talked about the general security situation or the
                    breakdown of security because of the refugees, the fact that the police force,
                    what was left of it because of the coup and the fighting, was swamped, and what
                    that might mean for security generally on the island. I don't recall
                    specifically what we said, but we came back out and left. We got out of there as
                    quickly as we could because the mob was getting bigger and as I said was just
                    not friendly. Again, nobody was hurt, there were no rocks thrown or any other
                    objects, but it was an ugly mood.</p>
                <p>The second phase started on the 14th, this was probably 17th or 18th. It was
                    several days before the 19th of August. We reported that, I think there was
                    anecdotal evidence or anecdotal comment from others in the embassy who had seen
                    or experienced similar things in smaller scale, but we didn't change our modus
                    operandi on the island or in Nicosia really. We maintained our contacts, we
                    traveled widely, I remember once Mike Austrian and I got in the car. We were
                    both cowboys but I have to say Mike was more of one and I think he would quickly
                    agree if he were still alive, God rest his soul. We got in the car, he was
                    driving, and we decided to go and tour some of the suburbs in Nicosia that were
                    affected by the fighting. We didn't cross any checkpoints, but we went up very
                    close to them, looked around, and saw where the new points had been established
                    and did a windshield tour of these areas and came back, and Mike did a quick
                    report. But what we didn't notice until the general services officer or somebody
                    pointed out, was that our car had acquired a new hole in the passenger door. It
                    was a bullet hole. We hadn't heard the shot and we certainly had not been aware
                    that a bullet - or some projectile with the diameter of a bullet - had hit the
                    car, but it happened. As I say, there was a strange sense which psychologists
                    could probably explain much better than I can, that we were invincible. We saw
                    all this violence and tracer bullets and tanks and walked over shell casings and
                    knew that people were dying, that refugees were being uprooted, that young women
                    were being raped. All this and that. We saw it and yet, at least speaking for
                    myself, did not think this was really going to happen to us. Because we were
                    diplomats, we had this great commanding overview, we had immunity, we spoke the
                    languages. And until August 19 that was right. We weren't being reckless in the
                    sense of telling the mob to bring it on, but we were going out, pushing the
                    envelope, doing what we thought was our job to go out and see and report.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I think Mike was the driver. He was a better driver than I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was on the passenger's side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It was on the passenger's side, but again I don't recall how close it
                    was to where I was sitting, but it was too close for comfort. We continued to go
                    out though. That hole, from whatever source, everybody thought it was a bullet,
                    we never found the bullet though, didn't change our way of doing things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go with Ambassador Davies on a number of his calls
                        during this period, or was this kind of an unusual one with Clerides?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Lindsay Grant, the DCM, had left sometime after the first invasion,
                    after the coup because his time was up. Another DCM had been chosen by Rodger,
                    but had not yet arrived. We were without a DCM, but we had an acting DCM. I
                    forget who that was. And Rodger assumed, quite reasonably, that since the
                    projected gap was only a few weeks there was no reason to keep Lindsay from
                    having his vacation to Scotland preparatory to his new job in Washington, so he
                    let Lindsay go. And I was the Greek language officer and the logical one to go
                    to the meetings with Clerides which of course were conducted in English.
                    Clerides' English is better than mine. But Mike could have done it if I was tied
                    up. There were several people who could have done that, but usually, from the
                    few experiences we had in these weeks I often went with Rodger as the note
                    taker. And I knew Cristobulu who was the chief of staff of Clerides which was a
                    big plus too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he was often in the meetings with Clerides?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Always.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, you want to come on to the 19th of August?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Well, the 19th of August we were in a staff meeting in the morning. It
                    was a weekday. I distinctly remember at the staff meeting that it had been
                    reported that there was going to be a demonstration of some kind. This was
                    something that would routinely be reported if you knew about a demonstration.
                    The police had told the RSO (Regional Security Officer) or something, somebody
                    got word there was going to be a demonstration. And that was all that was said.
                    We said oh yes, okay, that's fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A demonstration at the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I don't recall that it was at the embassy. I think it was a
                    demonstration away from the embassy, but the point was made that these were
                    volatile times, get a demonstration together 10 blocks away they could come this
                    way. I think somebody did connect those two dots. But we didn't spend any time
                    talking about precautions or preparations. We had a plan, the Marines had
                    certainly been briefed and trained and updated in their duties if something
                    should happen. And until this point there had been as far as I know no overt
                    attack, even by a rock throwing kid, against the compound where we were. Our
                    cars and our houses had been evacuated by this point, were intact. There'd been
                    no looting, no vandalism. Shaken fists perhaps and ugly gestures, but nothing
                    else.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The embassy at the time was surrounded by barbed wire
                        wall? No.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: We had the fence topped by barbed wire, I don't know if it was
                    concertina or something else. But there was the iron picket fence and the barbed
                    wire on top, and I think that went all the way around. Back in the back where
                    the parking lot was there was a gate that was a little easier to get through.
                    Essentially our strongest defense was in the front and on the sides. So again
                    we're all working and living in this very tight place. I think coming back to
                    something to which I alluded earlier, after the second invasion some of the
                    Greek Cypriots including Milteades, Cristobulu, the PIO from Makarios and now
                    Clerides, wound up for a while living in the compound. They were deathly afraid
                    of what might happen to them if the Turks should get them. And they moved in.
                    They sort of arrived at the gate with an aide or a family member. These weren't
                    large numbers, but the ambassador made the decision to let them in, put them in
                    some ground floor office somewhere which unfortunately had a telephone in it
                    which they started using. So we had to restrict their phone privileges,
                    establish rules of conduct for them while they were in this anomalous situation
                    on the ground. So we had this population too. Cristobulu's one, there were a
                    couple of them, maybe eight or 10 people, I don't remember. But not a large
                    number. But still, an element of foreigners you had to be aware of since they
                    weren't FSNs. They were there as refugees, but you know, whatever.. And I think
                    they were there when the thing went down on the 19th of August. Johnny
                    Cristafilis, an interesting anecdote, he had been the foreign minister of
                    Makarios and again of Clerides. And as I recall, we had met him socially, very
                    charming guy, like Clerides, London trained, a barrister, very distinguished,
                    good family, married to a lovely woman from South Africa, Marvel, also Greek. He
                    was foreign minister and he was scared to death when the Turks came to the
                    island the first time. It was either after the first invasion or the second
                    invasion when he was in his most panicky mode. I don't recall is Cristfidis
                    called me at the embassy or not. He wanted help. He did not, however, unlike
                    Cristabulu wind up as a refugee in the chancery, but he was scared and I think
                    that was a genuine fear, a very understandable one given the history of Greeks
                    and Turks in that part of the world. In any case, morning of August 19, sunny
                    day, cloudless skies, as it almost always is in Cyprus, and I think it was
                    around 9:30 or 10:00 I don't remember. There was a rumble you could hear, a
                    large number of people. I'd only heard that once before in my life and that was
                    when Ann and I were in Adana, Turkey at the consulate and the consulate was
                    stoned by a mob. I think I mentioned that in an earlier session, 1966 that was.
                    You never forget that once you hear it. And I heard it, and everybody else heard
                    it. We thought the demonstration had been approved by the police or whomever
                    some ways away. But it was a large mob. A large crowd. It wasn't a mob yet. I
                    think the focus of the discussion was criticism of the Americans for what had
                    happened to them, what had been done to them, what they had suffered. And
                    somehow, and I don't know how because I wasn't there, the crowd started moving
                    toward the embassy. At this point, I think it gained a lot of hangers-on and
                    other elements who might not have been in the original demonstration at all. By
                    the time it reached the embassy, which was in about 10 minutes, they were
                    throwing rocks and other things at the chancery. So we immediately had the
                    Marines and everybody else shove the wooden shutters so the glass would be
                    protected, close the gate, get the teargas canisters ready, and prepare to stave
                    off what we thought was going to be an unfettered demonstration, but that was
                    about all.</p>

                    <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Stave off in the sense that they would actually come over
                        the fence?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Keep them from coming over if they tried. The Marines had instructions
                    on what to do. They could get over, it was possible to get over, but I don't
                    recall that anybody did. Again, I was inside as everybody else was, and not
                    looking outside, or trying not to. The plan called us to gather in the central
                    hallway. The ambassador's office was shuttered and he and his secretaries came
                    in the central hallway. The rest of us were in the central hallway on the second
                    floor. The FSNs were there. It was very crowded. The air conditioning held up
                    for us, so it wasn't too hot, but it was a little sticky. And our offices which
                    had been on either side of that hallway, particularly that was facing the front,
                    were sort of exposed to the brunt of the mob's wrath we thought. At some point,
                    shooting started. I remember hearing pops or whatever, but did not think
                    anything of it because I didn't know what it was, and I'd never heard shots
                    fired in anger. I don't know how many shots were fired. Several pierced the
                    water tanks on the roof because they were leaking. Again, there was no central
                    direction, put your hands down and put your hands behind your head and hunker
                    down. We were milling around.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell where the shots were being fired from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I could not. It was in the context of a lot of roar. Rocks hitting the
                    embassy. You could hear the rocks. Occasionally a shutter would crack and you'd
                    hear glass break. We had no reason to think that we were going to be hurt,
                    because we were in the central corridor, the shutters were shut, the windows
                    were shut, the doors were shut, and we were in the safe area that had been
                    declared as such. So at some point, I think before the popping started, I
                    decided to go up on the roof of the ambassador's residence, the patio with
                    bamboo screening on the inside of the metal gratings outside. And Mike and I,
                    the two cowboys, went up to there to see what was going on. Better observation.
                    We thought that might be useful since we couldn't look through the shutters
                    because it was too dangerous and we weren't supposed to be in those rooms
                    anyway. Nobody said we could not go up to the patio and look down. And we
                    thought we'd be high enough there anyway. So I went up. The first thing I saw,
                    looking over the balcony toward the mob, was it did not fill the whole area. At
                    that time there was the street and a parking lot where various cars including
                    mine were, and beyond that was an embassy guest house where we had lived for
                    about six months when we first got to Cyprus. But the mob filled maybe half that
                    area. I can't say how many. Several hundred, maybe more. I don't recall it was
                    that huge. But I do recall seeing my car in flames. They torched the cars, and
                    then I saw the gas tank explode and the back end raised and came down. I'd never
                    seen that before. I actually thought it was kind of neat, even though at the
                    time I didn't know how I was going to get around without a car. Once again, I'm
                    looking at a mob now that is throwing rocks, attacking the embassy, torching the
                    cars. And there was some popping. I still did not make the connection. Somebody
                    must have been watching over me that day.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>It was also on American TV by the way, my mother was watching that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably not wise in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No. But she watched it that same day. Anyway, I thought that was pretty
                    neat, I'd never seen a car blow up, and this was a mob. I'd done that in Adana,
                    maybe a little bit larger, but that was it. So I went back to the backside of
                    the balcony. There was another in the back area looking down on the parking lot
                    behind the embassy. For some reason, there was no mob there, but the Marines had
                    thrown out tear gas, I guess as a precautionary measure. Maybe that's why there
                    was nobody there. But I do remember looking over that area and smelling this
                    funny thing and then taking a very deep breath to see what it was. It was C2 or
                    whatever the agent they were using. Never been teargassed before, or since, but
                    I went down on my hands and knees and was just totally disabled. It was very
                    effective teargas. It had risen the four or five stories that were between,
                    because it was deployed on the ground. And it came back up, got me. So at this
                    point I'm crawling on my hands and knees, trying to get back to the staircase
                    that goes down to a landing where there's a sink. I knew I could wash out my
                    eyes and clear my mouth and just get control of myself. And as I was crawling
                    back, whoever had the heavy artillery, the large caliber weapon down there,
                    opened up on the patio. And I could actually hear the bamboo ripping as the
                    bullets came through it. It was a huge roar. He must have sprayed the building,
                    because it seemed like a train. It got louder and louder as it came right toward
                    me and it went past me. I'm down on my hands and knees, the bullets are passing
                    harmlessly overhead and ripping through that bamboo. Again, I haven't been hurt,
                    but at this point I'm in the fetal position on the staircase trying to keep
                    myself from getting hurt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was Mike Austrian?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I'll come to him. I didn't know where he was exactly, but he has an
                    amusing story too. I get down to the landing, get my eyes clear so I can see and
                    I can breathe, and I'm able to get back up, go back up to the patio to see where
                    Mike is. There were also some Marines over there with teargas canisters. In
                    fact, they may have been the ones that threw the teargas canister down, but I
                    don't know that, the one that got me. But they did have teargas canisters to use
                    for mob control. And Mike had asked while I was looking at my car or whatever if
                    he could help. And the Marines said sure and handed him a canister of this
                    stuff. I never used one but it apparently has a rip-off thing like a beer
                    can.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Grenade?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Something like that, but it rips off and the stuff comes out very
                    quickly, and Mike was a strong guy but he was having trouble pulling off the
                    release tab. So he put the canister between his legs and pulled it off at which
                    point the full force of that agent virtually scalded his crotch and his front
                    and his face. It was like a white brush had been painted over him. And he was in
                    agony. He was also blinded. He was on his hands and knees, and the Marines,
                    there were two Marines out there. They were so astounded they were laughing
                    uproariously at this poor creature because nobody had ever done something that
                    dumb before, even at Camp Lejeune, and they'd never seen that before. Neither
                    had I. So I get up, my eyes are restored, I can breathe, I see Mike screaming
                    and yelling, hopping around and clutching his groin in great pain, I take him by
                    the scruff of the neck, down the steps to the basin, wash his face out, get him
                    so he can now take care of himself, and get him taken care of.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think the shots were fired at the patio at the top
                        of the residence because they had seen the Marines up there doing the
                        teargas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It's the same time the shots were fired at the ambassador's office. I
                    think there were two shooters. There would have had to be because the ones that
                    came in from the side, his office, were way over there, and this shot was up
                    here. And I always thought, and my memory's a little hazy on some of this, but
                    the rounds that came into the office of Ambassador Davies were concentrated in
                    the area of his office where his desk was. The rounds that came into the other
                    side of the building where the residence was were concentrated on the patio and
                    I think some at the window of his bedroom. I think that's right, though I'm not
                    sure of it. So whether or not they fired at the patio because they saw a Marine
                    or because they thought the ambassador was up there or because they saw me or
                    whatever, I really don't know. But there were a lot of bullets that came up
                    there. I always thought it was an effort to get the ambassador because of the
                    way the bullets had come in. By sheer dumb luck they did get him. It was a blind
                    bullet came in through the shutter, the glass and the partition in his office
                    and came down into the corridor where he was standing and they shot him through
                    the heart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was in the central hall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: He was, and he was dead before he hit the ground. Another bullet came
                    in and ripped off the top of the skull of Tony Varnava, a Maronite local in the
                    admin section, and she was dead instantly. And a steel jacket of one of the
                    bullets that came in landed up in the thigh of Jay Graham the economic officer.
                    Those were the only causalities from the rounds. One of the older locals may
                    have had a heart attack. Everybody else was intact but was scared to death.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tony Varnava had gone to Ambassador Davies' help?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: She had. She had been very close to him and she saw him fall. I was not
                    down there, but those who were say she saw him fall and bent down to catch him
                    and as she did her head was ripped open by the bullet, so they both fell.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say the window that the shots came through had the
                        partitions closed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes, the windows were appropriately shuttered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, we're continuing off the day of August 19,
                        1974.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: So the bullets did not have to go through significant physical barriers
                    to get to the Americans in the central corridor. I have no way of knowing
                    whether the shooter or shooters knew that we would be huddled in that corridor
                    as a safe place, but the wooden shutter over the window, the single pane of
                    glass and the partition on the door of the wall of the office were not very
                    thick. Of course, steel-jacketed rounds of that caliber. But it was a blind shot
                    that got the ambassador, no question about that. Tony was an incidental
                    casualty, God rest her soul, and Jay Graham was also unlucky with that minor
                    wound in his thigh.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The demonstration meanwhile was continuing although these
                        people shooting were probably in another building?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: They were not in another building; they were on the periphery of the
                    crowd in both cases. One of them was wearing the uniform of a Greek Cypriot
                    policeman as I recall, although the weapon he used was not in the standard arms
                    of the Greek Cypriot police. They were in the crowd on the periphery, but not in
                    adjacent buildings. There was some more shooting of handguns I guess. I think
                    though, soon after the heavy stuff came in and killed the ambassador, they
                    couldn't know at that time they killed the ambassador, and hit the side where
                    Mike and I and the Marines were, soon thereafter as I recall, maybe 20 or 30
                    minutes, time was really very strange as experienced in that day, the crowd
                    started to disperse. Either its anger had been spent or the Greek Cypriot police
                    had started to come in sufficient numbers to control it. Because what the Greek
                    Cypriot authorities had approved as a demonstration had quickly gotten way out
                    of hand and had to be stopped. I don't know who was calling, our phones were
                    still intact, I don't know who called whom. I certainly was not calling anybody
                    because I could still barely see, Mike wasn't. But somehow Clerides was alerted
                    about the attack on the embassy, and Clerides and Cristobulu came. There was
                    teargas in the front as well. It must have been all around the periphery because
                    I remember Clerides came up those stairs wearing a gas mask as did Cristobulu.
                    And he saw Rodger lying on the floor and I remember he ripped the gas mask off
                    and his face was contorted in anguish. It was just unbelievable how grief
                    stricken and surprised he was to see that. Because even though their association
                    had been fairly brief since Rodger had arrived as ambassador, I think there was
                    a lot of respect there. I don't think anybody thought that the tragic events of
                    that summer were going to lead to the assassination, or the murder, of
                    Ambassador Davies. So Clerides I think knelt down beside Rodger very briefly to
                    assure himself that he was dead, and then because we were still in a very
                    chaotic situation where even his security could not be guaranteed, he and his
                    staff left to go back to the office. We of course had to tell Washington what
                    had happened. We had to work with the Greek Cypriots to reestablish our security
                    because we had no idea what was still out there waiting for us. I remember
                    telling Cristobulu. Cris and I were talking about it that night. This was the
                    night of the 19th of August. I told him we needed to have a lot more police
                    security than we'd gotten. At this stage the Clerides government was supposed to
                    give us everything we asked for, so I said give us everything. Give us fixed
                    post, give us snipers on the roof against the mob, give us everything. I don't
                    know what I specifically asked for. But it was yes sir, yes sir three bags full;
                    they did give us tremendous presence around the chancery. There were no more
                    demonstrations, certainly no more mobs against the embassy. And I don't really
                    remember how long that protection lasted.</p>
                <p>It took a long while for the teargas to disperse. Mike of course reeked of it
                    because it was in his pores. He really had second degree burns that got better
                    as you came up from the crotch toward the face. Fortunately it didn't start in
                    his face or he would have been blinded. And having staff meetings with him in
                    close quarters was no pleasant experience because he couldn't help it. Even
                    after showering he still stank of C2.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The two of you came down from the patio from the roof soon
                        after the ambassador was hit?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Fairly soon. There was a tremendous confusion and walkie talkie chatter
                    which Ann heard. I forgot to mention, a couple days before the 19th Ann had told
                    Rodger she and Ben just wanted to go back to our house. There'd been no
                    demonstrations at that point, the house was okay, and we thought Maria our maid
                    would show up. With great reluctance, maybe it was the night before, Rodger let
                    her go home. So Ann and Ben were not there when this happened, they were at
                    home. But they were in radio or walkie talkie contact with us and they heard
                    over that system this tremendous jumble of screams and yells and confusion. A
                    British neighbor had called Ann and said that from her balcony she could see
                    smoke coming from the American embassy and maybe Ann ought to find out what was
                    going on. So when Ann tuned in the walkie talkie all she got was this confusion.
                    Didn't know what had happened to any of us at that point.</p>
                <p>So we came down fairly soon after Rodger... we heard the ambassador had been
                    shot, we'd heard yells either on the radio from the Marines or something that
                    the ambassador had been hit. So we went down, and there was this tremendous
                    milling about and yells and screams, and teargas everywhere. And lying on the
                    floor where he'd fallen was Rodger and next to him was Tony and Jay Graham was
                    standing with a trickle of blood coming down his thigh and looking very shocked
                    as many people were. Shell-shocked, literally, as to what had happened. I
                    remember I knelt down to Rodger and I just said, “Oh, Mr. Ambassador,” and I
                    couldn't say anything else because he was clearly gone. I think it had gone
                    right through his heart so there was no question about saving him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Besides Clerides coming, I assume a doctor came?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I don't recall medical personnel coming. We had some medically trained
                    folk. EMT qualified, probably from the Marines and elsewhere who hustled Jay off
                    to treatment and quickly realized that nothing could be done for Tony and
                    Rodger. I don't remember any other medical people coming.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was in charge of the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Well this was the awkward point and something I remembered for the rest
                    of my career. We were officially without a DCM because Rodger had chosen not to
                    designate an acting DCM. The reasonable expectation that the new DCM would be
                    there in just a few weeks, so... it was a reasonable expectation at the time.
                    But it was a difficult situation because in fact the senior Foreign Service
                    person by rank was Eddie Edwards who had been very close to Tony Varnava and was
                    himself shell-shocked and not able to think clearly as he himself I think would
                    admit. At least in the first few days after August 19. But for whatever reason,
                    Eddie is also African American, he felt very strongly and said so in this mini
                    staff meeting we had in the vault where the air conditioning was not working,
                    that he should be the charg� because he was the senior person in rank. And there
                    was argument and discussion about that. It wasn't the finest hour for any of us,
                    I don't think, but I finally decided that the only way to solve this was to
                    agree that rank should prevail and that Mike or I would go with Eddie whenever
                    he had to do business. So we basically voted that Eddie would be the charg�. I
                    don't think all members of the country team accepted that. But it was such a
                    confused time it really didn't matter almost, because we were all doing our own
                    thing and in very close contact with Washington as well. So whenever Eddie had
                    to go, we would have to go ask Clerides for something, this was before Dean
                    Brown got there, there was only one or two meetings with Clerides, no more than
                    that. Maybe just one. I went with Eddie. We prepped him, we had the list, he
                    would ask for whatever we needed. Clerides of course would give it; there was no
                    question about that. At one point somehow the victims were mentioned and Eddie
                    briefly broke down because as I say he and Tony had been very, very close. But
                    on the whole I thought, and I don't mean to sound condescending at all, he was
                    an admin officer who had done admin work his whole career in the military and
                    the Foreign Service; he had never done work of this kind, under these
                    circumstances. Given what had happened I thought he did pretty well, and it was
                    only a brief period and he had strong support from Mike, from me, from others.
                    So it was a team that went to see Clerides and a team that dealt with the other
                    officials of the UNFICYP and the Greek Cypriot government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Davies did not have any family of his own at
                        post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: He did. Dana is the daughter and John is her younger brother, and they
                    had briefly come to post with Rodger and Ms. T the family cat. Rodger's wife had
                    died tragically after a long struggle with brain cancer just that year. And so
                    one of the reasons he wanted to go overseas and come to Cyprus was to get away
                    from Washington and the intense environment he'd been working and living in
                    there, and also get away from, I think, some of the memories of Sally and what
                    she'd gone through in the last years of her life. And Nicosia was going to be a
                    way for the family to replenish itself, just relax and recover a bit. And
                    tragically it did not work out that way. So John and Dana had been in the convoy
                    that went south to Akrotiri in late July and were in Beirut, and had to be told
                    what had happened to their father on August 19th.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you about Ann and Ben at this point. They were
                        back home, did they stay there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, they were there when it happened and Ann was very concerned about
                    me of course and others in the embassy because she had no idea if any of us were
                    alive or who had been shot. She knew somebody had been shot, but from the
                    squawking over the walkie talkie it was just not clear. I was able to talk to
                    her a few hours later, say I was alright, tell her briefly what had happened.
                    And then she decided on her own that she and Ben were going to have to make some
                    defensive preparations because there was no way of knowing if the mob would
                    regroup and come after the houses. Some Greek Cypriots certainly knew we were in
                    the house, but it was a low profile. Any case, Ann told Ben as a way of keeping
                    him from worrying and to occupy his fertile four year old mind they were going
                    to have to boil water and pour it on the heads of people who came to the house
                    to try to do them harm. Ben thought that was a great plan so he and Ann put huge
                    kettles of water on the stove, propane fired stove and they fired up all the
                    burners, and the water was starting to simmer when there was a loud knock at the
                    door downstairs. Somebody in a very English accent, sort of Cockney type accent
                    asked to be let in. Ann and Ben had barricaded chairs. We had a house on stilts
                    with a marble foyer and a walkup; they had barricaded chairs at the top of the
                    staircase so it would prevent people from getting into them, at least quickly.
                    But the water was only simmering, it wasn't boiling. So whoever it was, some guy
                    said let us in and Ann said no we're not going to let you in, and back and
                    forth. This is what she's told me, I was not there, but I've heard the story
                    many times. And she told Ben to keep turning the flames up, give it more juice
                    to get the water ready, because they thought it was a Greek Cypriot or somebody
                    like that. And finally she asked, “Who are you people?” Because she knew there
                    were several folks milling around down there. And he said, “ We're Canadians.”
                    And she said, “What's the capital of Canada?” Putting them to the test, because
                    if he was a Greek Cypriot he wouldn't know that. And then she thought, what is
                    the capital of Canada? And there was some more comment, apparently this trooper,
                    turned out to be an UNFICYP trooper made a comment to one of his mates that who
                    is this nutcase? And he said it in such an idiomatic way that Ann said that
                    can't be a Greek Cypriot and pushed the buzzer to let him in. As soon as the
                    door opened when she pushed the buzzer from up top, these armed UNFICYP troops
                    swarmed in with their rifles drawn and tried to come get the bad guys and they
                    came up the stairs and moved the chairs and established that Ann and Ben were ok
                    and they were not in any danger. And Ann said why are you here? And they said
                    we've left our post and the only reason we're here is some crazy Greek Cypriot
                    lady told us that you were being attacked and so we came to help. And that crazy
                    Greek Cypriot lady was Maria our maid who had fled the house when the embassy
                    was stormed. Ann told her to leave. She wanted to stay but Ann said no, you
                    better get out of here because if they come this way they could hurt you too. So
                    Maria left, but on the way out was apparently able to flag down an UNFICYP
                    patrol and divert them to the house with all kinds of stories. So the leader,
                    these were Canadian UNFICYP troops and the leader of the group said we can't
                    leave you here, but we can't take you with us either yet. So he said we'll take
                    you to your neighbor. The neighbors lived across the driveway in another house
                    like ours. And they'd been very good friends of ours and had sort of adopted
                    Ben. They had no children of their own. He'd been a judge.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: British?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, Greek Cypriot. Court trained, impeccable English. But they had lost
                    vast citrus groves in Famagusta or somewhere and seen what had happened with
                    themselves in great fury over what America had not done to stop this horrible
                    desecration of their island. I'm drawing a blank on their surname. It was Laura
                    and Antinoches. Anyway, Antinoches was not there when the UNFICYP troops took
                    Ann and Ben over. Ann had about two minutes to pack what she needed so she took
                    her passport, pictures, and family silver and Ben took his Matchbox cars in his
                    little case and that was it. So the UNFICYP troops took them over to Gregoriades
                    I think it was, over to their apartment, knocked on the door, Laura appears, and
                    the UNFICYP captain says what they want to do, and Laura said something to the
                    effect that the Bible says to forgive even worst enemy and in that spirit I will
                    let them come in, at which point Ann's redheaded nature asserted itself and she
                    said, “Like hell you will,” and started to go back home. So the UNFICYP people
                    literally shoved Ann and Ben into Laura's apartment, shut the door and left. And
                    I won't bother you with all the ends and odds. They worked out a modus vivendi.
                    Laura took Ben to bake cookies in the kitchen, left Ann alone so she wouldn't
                    have to argue with her, just avoid her, and that was fine with Ann too. So they
                    stayed there until sometime that evening. This would have been late morning on
                    the 19th. So sometime late afternoon or evening an UNFICYP vehicle came to pick
                    them up and took them from the apartment down to the officer's club which was on
                    the airport road and that was within a secure perimeter. So this was preparatory
                    to their being evacuated because at that point there was no question that they
                    would have to be evacuated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was a UN officers' club?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: UNFICYP. UN or Canadian. But it seemed that everybody was Canadian
                    there from what I saw and what Ann said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the Nicosia sector.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yeah, on the way to the airport on the left, it was a big building on
                    stilts as you went to the airport, and it was an officers' club and they put Ann
                    in the bed of the commandant because that was the only bed they had there I
                    think. And Ben was sort of adopted as a mascot by these young troops who took
                    him around to all the slot machines, and over the course of the next five or six
                    hours Ben played slot machines and won lots of money, and they told him, “Every
                    time you win you have to stand the house for drinks, buy drinks for the house,”
                    which he did. Around 12 or one that morning they brought him back to Ann, he was
                    on some soldier's shoulders with two bags of coins, his winnings, and looking
                    very bleary eyed from too much Coke, otherwise not much worse for the wear.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: He remembers it pretty well because he was almost five. A month later
                    he was five. And it was exciting stuff for him. He had all these big brother
                    playmates, the Marine guards and then his big brother playmates from all around,
                    he had all these Canadian troops. And he won and could buy drinks for all his
                    friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ann and Ben were eventually flown out then by
                        helicopter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: We worked this out over phone calls with Washington that night; the
                    president sent a plane to bring back the ambassador's body. It was the same
                    plane that brought back the embassy staff from Beirut. That went to Beirut,
                    picked up the kids and the other embassy staff who were still there, then came
                    to Cyprus to Akrotiri to pick up the ambassador's body. Stopped to refuel, in
                    Shannon and then back home. That was the plan, and through talking with Art
                    Hartman who was at the time the Assistant Secretary of EUR, and somebody else, I
                    convinced them to let Ann and Ben come on that plane and go all the way back to
                    America. That was approved fairly quickly actually, didn't take too much
                    argument. And the ambassador's body was prepared for flight at the Nicosia
                    general hospital. The death certificate said he'd been killed by a stray bullet.
                    Maybe that's forensically correct, but it was not correct. When the plane did go
                    and pick up the two kids and the cat in Beirut, it came to Akrotiri and then the
                    issue was to get Ann and Ben and the casket down to Akrotiri, so an UNFICYP
                    helicopter was arranged. They brought Rodger's casket to the UNFICYP wherever
                    the helipad was. I don't recall right now. I was there and went down to Akrotiri
                    with them on that chopper. Ann was brought out on a stretcher. She was still
                    bedridden. Ben came on his own. There were some troops. It was one of these very
                    military helicopters so there was no door. It was very, very loud and there was
                    some guy hanging on a cable looking out with a gun to make sure nobody was going
                    to shoot the helicopter from down there on the ground, because we were flying
                    fairly low. But we got to Akrotiri with no problem at all. So I had a short
                    while to say goodbye to Ann. This was on the 20th of August. I said goodbye to
                    her and Ben, knowing they were going to be flown back to the States. And I guess
                    I came back to Nicosia by the same helicopter. I don't remember. Dean Brown had
                    meanwhile arrived at Akrotiri. He was the one who Washington sent out to take
                    charge of the embassy until more permanent leadership could be sent in.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes, it seemed longer than that at the time. Probably closer to 48
                    because I think he was still doing stuff. But yes, very short period of
                    time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, I think he was undersecretary for management at the time. He came
                    out as a temporary ambassador on the 20th of August. Washington knew we had no
                    DCM and I think it must have known we were having trouble cohering as a country
                    team because there was no natural leader there. It was very wise that they sent
                    out somebody like Dean Brown who took charge instantly, no question about that.

                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Lindsay was ordered back out of Scotland. They found him in some fjord
                    in Scotland fishing or something. Lindsay was a great naturalist and genuinely
                    enjoyed it. Very good at it. They tracked him down in some remote area of
                    northern Scotland, got him on a British military plane to come down to Akrotiri,
                    and so roughly about the same time, I don't remember in what order he showed up.
                    Again, on a TDY basis until a regular DCM could get there. That was the idea
                    that Washington had. In the end, Lindsay and Dean Brown did not work together
                    that long. I think what happened was that Dean Brown decided that Lindsay could
                    leave fairly soon before the regular ambassador got out, because at that point
                    we knew that Bill Crawford would be coming and Brown decided there was no point
                    to hold Lindsay. So as I recall, Lindsay left to go take up his job in
                    Washington. Brown stayed around until Crawford got there and then Crawford's DCM
                    came in soon thereafter.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ambassador Bill Crawford had been previously the DCM in
                        Nicosia, before you were there I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: He was DCM before we were there. He and Ginger came back from Yemen
                    where he was serving as ambassador several times in our first year there because
                    they loved Cyprus, they had a beach house up in Kyrenia, Totlasu rather, and
                    they had many, many friends on the island.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Came back on leave during that period. Do you remember
                        when he came back then as ambassador to Cyprus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It would have been in September it seems to me, or October. Dean Brown
                    was not there more than a few weeks as I recall. I don't precisely remember.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dean Brown's main mandate during that period was
                        security...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Well, security, to get the embassy working again as a team, to
                    establish good relations with the Clerides government. Just put things back
                    together again, because it was perceived, I think correctly, that things needed
                    putting back together in the embassy. And Dean Brown was a very tough and able
                    guy who did that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you continued to do your political...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Actually, I probably did more for Dean Brown than I'd done for Rodger,
                    because I was in the fortunate position, as was Mike Austrian, of being
                    well-versed in Cyprus at this point. Knowing the language of the Greeks' side,
                    able to translate for him, and there were a lot of communiqu�s and stuff that I
                    translated for him. And being physically intact and mentally intact from what
                    had happened on the 19th of August. Several folks had to be evacuated after that
                    because they were not just shell-shocked, they were seriously troubled and it
                    would have been cruel and unkind and unwise to keep them there in that
                    condition. So Mike and I and Red Jessup and the station chief were the core
                    group that stayed on. We by great luck kept our wits and our bodies intact and
                    we had contacts so Dean Brown used us very, very heavily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He did not have any particular background in Cyprus.
                        Obviously, very experienced senior officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Very experienced guy, no particular background in Cyprus though he did
                    have experience in the Middle East I guess. Maybe he had gotten over to Cyprus
                    at some point. I really don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was in Jordan in 1970 wasn't he when Black
                        September?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I think you're right. He was a joy to work for, a good leader in a
                    difficult time. Dave Gremlin was another one; he was the PAO and had a lot of
                    experience in Cyprus too. So Brown essentially had a cadre of five or six people
                    who really knew the place, had their marbles, were unafraid and could advise him
                    well. And he was very good about seeking advice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Bill Crawford came, a new DCM came, who was that?</hi>

                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Fred Brown came down. I don't remember how Bill had picked Fred.
                    Rodger's DCM never made it because that assignment was aborted. I don't even
                    remember who it was, frankly. But Fred Brown came and he and Bill were a good
                    team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You stayed there until summer of '75, a year later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: That's right. That's a somewhat sore point between my wife and me
                    because Ann wanted to get me out of that hellhole as she described it often,
                    after she was evacuated back to the States. She and Ben wound up living with my
                    mother in Arlington for almost a year, and the expectation was for months and
                    months that the families would come back very soon. Once the fighting stopped,
                    the second round, the ceasefire lines were established and UNFICYP established
                    the perimeter, the expectation was the families would start coming back fairly
                    soon. As I recall they didn't start coming back until the first quarter, maybe
                    the second quarter of '75. It took a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a daughter that was born.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Ann was pregnant, I went back in November to see how she and Ben were
                    doing, to see mother and everything was fine. Then Laura, our daughter, was born
                    on January 19, 1975 and I got back for that just a few hours before.</p>
                <p>Coincidentally, the day Laura was born the headline story in the Post with
                    pictures was of the next Greek Cypriot demonstration that attacked the embassy,
                    and this time they torched the place. They got into the back parking lot where
                    the motor pool was, set fire to some of the lower offices and cars, nobody was
                    hurt. Certainly nobody was shot, thank God, but it was an ugly reminder of how
                    volatile the situation still was. I think that headline that greeted Ann when
                    Laura was born sort of convinced her that she was never going back to the island
                    with her children. I decided with great reluctance that I would curtail, because
                    at this point I had about 18 months to go. I was on a three year assignment. The
                    government invested a lot of money in training me for a year in Greek, so I
                    asked to curtail to basically anyplace that came up. But pending that, I had to
                    go back to the island. And I did. I must say, Crawford's reaction was
                    interesting. He was not pleased, since understandably he didn't want to lose one
                    of his key people in a difficult time. He thought it was unprofessional and told
                    me so. And said he had thought about disciplining me, but decided not to. And
                    having said that, we then had I thought a very good professional relationship
                    for the rest of my tour there which was almost six months. When we encountered
                    each other subsequently, we stayed friends even though he was very, very
                    unhappy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you came back out of Cyprus twice?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yeah, in November and January. I was working to get another job
                    somewhere, and I was sort of desperate to get anywhere out of Cyprus just so I
                    could get the family together. It had to be an accompanied post, and what came
                    up was an economic/commercial job in Bonn. that was the job I got, replacing Joe
                    Winder in the summer of 1975 which meant that I was in Cyprus until roughly
                    early July, after the July Fourth party and then left and flew to Frankfurt and
                    met Ann and the children there and then we went up to Bonn.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're picking up the oral history interview with James
                        Williams on the 22nd of October 2004, and Jim we pretty much completed your
                        discussion of being a political officer in Nicosia from '73 to '75. And then
                        you were assigned I believe to Bonn? What did you do there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I was assigned to Bonn initially as an economic/commercial officer to
                    what was then called the general economic policy section. GEP, as was the
                    acronym. I had had only a few months of economic/commercial experience. That was
                    during my time as a central complement rotational officer in embassy Ankara. So
                    my credentials for that assignment were fairly thin. So, as part of my
                    in-processing when I was back on leave in January of '75, I went over to the
                    Department of Commerce to meet their EUR folk and show them I didn't have two
                    heads, or whatever it was I was supposed to show them. Anyways, apparently they
                    had no objection to my assignment; we pledged a good working relationship which
                    we had, so I went on to Bonn to be a member of the economic/commercial
                    section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And as I recall you explained that this was actually a
                        direct transfer and that there was also an opportunity for your family to
                        rejoin you after they had been separated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: That's correct. Ann and I had decided when Laura was born, on the day
                    that another mob had hit the embassy in Nicosia, that going back to Nicosia with
                    a family in the near future was not a very smart thing to do, even if the
                    department allowed it. And indeed the families began to return as I recall in
                    the spring of '75. At that point, when Laura was born in January of '75 I still
                    had a year and a half to go. And so I asked for curtailment and direct transfer
                    to some point that would be more family friendly. And by good luck and the
                    assistance of some friends the job in Bonn was identified and my assignment to
                    Nicosia was broken. This did not for obvious reasons go down very well with the
                    ambassador in Nicosia, Bill Crawford, who thought he was losing an important
                    member of his team at a critical time. It was a critical time. He listened to my
                    reasons; I don't think he ever agreed with them but he never opposed to
                    curtailment or the transfer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in Bonn you became an economic officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: In Bonn I became an economic officer. The economic section job to which
                    I had been assigned had been held by John Winder, who had left some months
                    earlier.</p>
                <p>The job itself was primarily energy. This was in the post-OPEC embargo era when
                    IEA - the International Energy Agency - had been inaugurated and was very much
                    in the ascendancy. There was a lot of interest in Washington and the energy
                    portfolio was fairly interesting at the time. I knew very little about energy so
                    I had a learning curve to go through. My contacts were primarily the ministry of
                    energy, natural resources, there were some other contacts as I recall in the
                    ministry of industry. And perhaps the ministry of foreign affairs when it came
                    to dealing with OPEC and IEA. But as I learned after I got into the job a bit,
                    what had happened when Joe Winder left some months before I got there in the
                    summer of '75, his job had been picked apart and certain parts of it had been
                    transferred to others who were hungry, as they say, for more work. And once I
                    got the energy portfolio down - it took me a few months, maybe six or seven
                    months - I quickly started looking for other things to do.</p>
                <p>Ed Crawley, who was the head of the overall economic part of the embassy which
                    included a whole lot of other agencies such as the DEA, the IRS and others,
                    would give me jobs from time to time. I was asked to write speeches for
                    Ambassador Hillenbrand which took a lot of time, and it was nice to get the
                    attention of being a speech writer, but it wasn't exactly what I wanted to do.
                    My contacts in the Ministry of Energy were first rate people, I really enjoyed
                    working with them, and I stayed in touch with them for years after that. But as
                    I had fancied myself a political officer from the start of my career - I had
                    never really done political work except for my abbreviated tour in Nicosia - I
                    looked for an opportunity to move over to the political section. That
                    opportunity came unexpectedly when a member of the political section had to
                    curtail for health reasons, so in November of '76 he left very suddenly, and I
                    was offered the job.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately this was not done through channels. Ed Crawley had heard about it
                    after the decision was made and after I'd accepted, and it was a painful lesson
                    for me - I should've known better - I had to explain to Ed what had happened. He
                    was gracious, though he didn't like it, but he graciously let me go and did not
                    object to the transfer. So in November of '76 at Embassy Bonn I was once again a
                    political officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was arranged at Embassy Bonn without much
                        involvement from Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I don't know what Washington's involvement was because there was no
                    powerful central personnel system at this time; I'm sure Washington was
                    informed, because the billet that I was moved into was unencumbered when Jack
                    Hurley left and my billet had to be filled by somebody else from Washington. But
                    basically the switch was made at embassy Bonn.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what sort of political work did you do in the
                        political section at Bonn beginning November of '76?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Well I was the junior member of a two man section dedicated to the
                    internal political affairs of the Federal Republic of Germany. As the title
                    implies it's a federal system so politics is very important at the state level.
                    There was a lot of travel involved to the so called youth political wing - it's
                    like young republicans, young democrats - but they meet every year. They're well
                    financed, and these organizations were very assiduous in hosting foreign
                    diplomatic observers who were invited to view what they had to do and say
                    because they were the rising generation of politicians in Germany. For example,
                    the current chancellor was one of the young socialist leaders towards the end of
                    my tour there. There were others who came up through the ranks of the young
                    union. The free democrats, the youth branch and so on.</p>
                <p>Bill Bodde was my boss for the first part of my tour in internal affairs, until
                    the summer of '77 and then Vlad Lehovich came and for the balance of my tour the
                    next two years - Vlad and I were the domestic affairs unit. It was a lot of fun.
                    The travel was fun because we would go together to the large political
                    congresses of the SPD, the CVU. We didn't cover the CSU, the Bavarian equivalent
                    of the Christian Democratic Union, led by Franz Joseph Strauss. That was done
                    and guarded very jealously by the consulate general in Munich. Harry Gilmore did
                    that at the time and he and I were very close colleagues. My only experiences
                    with Franz Joseph Strauss unfortunately were as observer in the Federal
                    Parliament (Bundestag). Even in that late phase of his career he could give some
                    of the best speeches of any member of the Bundestag. In fact, Strauss was so
                    good, so extemporaneously good, and so witty, and so pithy, that even the
                    backbenchers of the SPD who normally - always - hated his politics, admired his
                    rhetorical art and would laugh and even applaud at some of his wittier sallies.
                    It was a lot of fun to listen to, sometimes hard to follow, but essentially we
                    reported on what the German politicians were doing in their congress, what the
                    main debates were, whether it was missiles, or defense, or budget, or taxation
                    or whatever. Political scandals that came up. We had a reporting plan to be
                    sure.</p>
                <p>But most of the stuff we assigned ourselves - it was our choice. It wasn't to
                    meet some plan, so a lot of the stuff - as politics tends to be - was ad hoc; a
                    scandal, an opening caused by a death, a change of coalition partner, whatever.
                    It was a lot of fun. Largely because of the subject matter, which inherently
                    interested me, largely because of the freedom we had - we had a budget, a modest
                    budget, that allowed Bill Bodde and me, Vlad and me, sometimes just me alone
                    when it was a young political group, to travel, to spend several days with the
                    German political groups and to really develop fantastic contacts. This helped
                    considerably when the time came to schedule a visit to Bonn by President
                    Carter.</p>
                <p>Brzezinski came often. A few folk came from Washington. We had scheduled quite a
                    few folks from Germany to Washington, it was a lot of fun.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>Q; And your German was good enough to do all of this?</p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Fortunately I'd minored in German and I'd studied the language
                    seriously since high school and through college and came in with a 3 + 3+ it was
                    tested at 5/5 in my home leave during the summer of '77 - that was the days when
                    the testers at FSI were perhaps more quickly dazzled than they are today, or
                    feeling more generous. But in any case my German was very good, and stayed very
                    good, got even better for the whole tour.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you the control officer for some of these visits? Or
                        were you just with others in the embassy involved with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It would depend. For example, I had a contact in the Federal
                    Chancellor's office which was kind of like the NSC only it handled both domestic
                    and foreign issues. It was a contact I had inherited from somebody. He was sort
                    of in the third echelon below the chancellor, but one of the chancellor's closer
                    associates. So, for example, when Carter's visit was being set up, I was the
                    liaison to arrange logistics, to include intelligence support, that is make sure
                    we had secure rooms for our intelligence services. So that helped me develop my
                    vocabulary in the intelligence field which was not too full before then.</p>
                <p>But there were visit by the IPU - the Inter Parliamentary Union - the IPU had one
                    of it's quadrennial meetings in Bonn in '78, I believe, or late '77. Our
                    delegation was led by Senator Robert Stafford from Vermont. It was a bipartisan
                    delegation of ten members, House and Senate, and as many staffers and more. I
                    was the sole control officer for that group and covered everything from making
                    sure the arrangements at the hotel were acceptable to handling any particular
                    issues they had. They were a self sufficient delegation, they had their own
                    liquor and their own control room and this and that but I was the one from the
                    embassy to make sure nothing went wrong.</p>
                <p>There were certain other visitors that came - I can't remember them all now - but
                    we had a fairly busy time with visitors. Sometimes we would grouse to ourselves
                    - only half seriously - about how we thought we were a travel bureau, but it
                    goes with the turf and it added ultimately to the enjoyment and the success of
                    our work there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Federal Republic of Germany was certainly an important
                        ally, an important country to the United States, Berlin, throughout western
                        Europe in the period you were there...did you have the sense that agencies
                        in Washington were really interested in the domestic political doings that
                        you were reporting on? I'm sure they were at the times of elections, and
                        things like that but some of the future leaders and some of the detail...did
                        you have the feeling sometimes that you were sending something to the
                        files?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: If not to the files certainly to a limited number of desk officers in
                    the agency and at State. Perhaps in the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA) who
                    followed the Federal republic of Germany closely. We didn't often get feedback
                    or comment or request for information on our basic reporting on what the SPD had
                    done in its congress in Hamburg or what the Bundestag debate on taxation really
                    meant for the stability of the government of Helmut Schmidt. However, he had a
                    very narrow majority for the bulk of the time I was there. After the federal
                    election of '76 he governed essentially with a five vote majority, which in
                    American circumstances would be almost impossible. But given the party whips and
                    the effectiveness of party discipline over all parties in Germany, it worked.
                    But what that meant is that Schmidt often had to satisfy the so-called rebels
                    within the ranks of the SPD - these were backbenchers of no particular
                    consequence who saw an opportunity to get a few headlines and sort of exploit a
                    situation for their own benefit, and they did.</p>
                <p>That situation and the prospect that Schmidt might lose a vote on some key issue
                    because of these guys made Washington a little bit more interested in some of
                    this stuff. But your basic point is correct - there wasn't a whole lot of
                    expressed interest, at least to me, on issues that we reported on with one major
                    exception. There were other exceptions but the one that really sticks in my mind
                    favorable was the debate the German people and their representatives in the
                    Bundestag had for over a year when the issue of the abolition of the death
                    penalty - I'm sorry, the issue of the law came up that provides for life in
                    prison. I've got this wrong. Under German law, there was no death penalty first
                    of all.</p>
                <p>But there was the possibility of giving life in prison for Nazi criminals if they
                    were prosecuted within initially a 20 year period and then a 30 year period. The
                    issue was the statute of limitations that affected the penalties for Nazi
                    crimes. I was in Germany in this political job from '77 to '79. At that point
                    the 30 year statute of limitations on capital crimes in the Nazi period was
                    about to run out. Because it started running several years after the war ended.
                    At that time there were still a few trials underway of minor officials from
                    Auschwitz, from other camps, though the witnesses, the survivors, the people who
                    took part in the proceedings were old and memories were fading. There were still
                    enough of them alive to be of consequence, and there was a broad feeling among
                    certain members of the German people, and more importantly, a large number of
                    American people, who felt that justice should be done here, and not allowed to
                    be thwarted because the statute of limitations had run out.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>We did not have such a statute of limitations in America. So one of the initial
                    things to explain to our reading audience back in Washington - which on this
                    issue was very large - because of the political dynamics of holocaust issues in
                    America - was that the German system was different, why it was different, and
                    what the options were. The decision to essentially abolish the statute of
                    limitations on murder, which is what it came down to, murder in the broadest
                    sense, was a political one. There was a substantial body of opinion in Germany,
                    including in Schmidt's own party, which opposed any further tampering with the
                    statute of limitations, on the grounds that that is what the Nazi's had done
                    with the law books in their times. And therefore, once laws had been passed they
                    should not be changed for essentially political ends, even though the stated
                    objective was a worthy one.</p>
                <p>So it was a debate of principle, a very passionate debate on both sides, and one
                    in which a number of people came from Washington, or from America, to express
                    their concern to the Chancellor and to the political leaders of Germany. I was
                    the embassy liaison with theses groups. I remember one group; it was an
                    interfaith group, with the head of the anti-defamation league, the NAACP, labor
                    leaders, about ten or fifteen distinguished Americans, most of whose names I'd
                    read about in the papers but I'd never met before. They came as part of a
                    bipartisan interfaith delegation to express their concern to chancellor Schmidt
                    - who spoke fluent English.</p>
                <p>And he spent easily an hour of time with them, discussing the issue, his own
                    personal views, the politics of it, and without committing himself to the
                    outcome said he could assure them it would be an outcome of integrity. And in
                    the end I think they left, more or less satisfied that they had been heard. When
                    the vote finally came, the Bundestag did vote to abolish the statute of
                    limitations on murder. But over a period of, I would say, four months, maybe
                    longer, this was an issue on the front page of the German press, it was
                    something we reported on almost every week. there were special reports written
                    on it based on our reporting, sometimes they would quote it verbatim - I was
                    rather amused about that - without giving us credit. I chided my friend John
                    Maypother who did that once, but I mention it just to indicate the degree of
                    interest back here in an issue that was far more than just a German domestic
                    political decision.</p>
                <p>So at the end of the day the statute was abolished on that particular crime and
                    that meant that any Nazi criminal from the third Reich, no matter how ancient or
                    feeble, could be captured and prosecuted if evidence was found to deduce his
                    guilt during the third Reich. This was a victory more of principle than of
                    practicality. I think the number of trials that followed the abolition were very
                    very few.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Schmidt government in coalition with the free
                        democrats?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: They were indeed. And that coalition was under some strain because
                    they'd been in power - they'd been together - for some time since the free
                    democrats had switched to coalition with the SPD. There were always conservative
                    members of the FDP who wanted to go back to their earlier coalition with the
                    CSU, but Hans-Dietrich Genscher who was the head of the FDP and the foreign
                    minister, and Schmidt managed to keep the wild men in both their parties under
                    control , and keep the coalition going for the whole time I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And during this period I think in Italy and in Rome and in
                        London, political sections with several officers covering the domestic
                        political situation tended to specialize, so in London I think there was
                        someone who did the conservatives, someone else who did the Labor party, and
                        I think that was true in Rome. That was not true in Bonn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: That was not true in Bonn. We discussed that several times, but
                    essentially, even though our political section was large, there were only two of
                    us who did domestic affairs. We thought - this decision was made before I got
                    there and I think it was a good one, we certainly affirmed it any number of
                    times - that was better for Bill and me, and later Vlad and me to be acceptable
                    and known and welcome in all the parties and their youth groups rather than to
                    be specialized in one or the other. And it worked out fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you did tend to mainly connect with the three main
                        parties, CDU, SPD and the free democrats, what about the small parties both
                        the left - the communists - and the far right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: We had no dealings with the communists, or whatever their name was at
                    the time. With the Greens we had some dealings, particularly after they entered
                    the state parliament. We did meet with a few of the greens. I think we even went
                    to their national convention once, again on invitation. And that was fun, but
                    they were quite different from the other groups, deliberately so, they were also
                    a bit more awkward with our status, and how to deal with us as members of the
                    so-called capitalist, imperialist NATO class. But on a whole our relations were
                    cordial and I had a lot more to do with them in Berlin, and we'll get to that
                    later.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>There's one more issue I should have mentioned, that really was at least as
                    neuralgic and explosive in Germany and watched as carefully in Washington as was
                    the debate on the statute of limitations on murder. That was the whole question
                    of terrorism. The Baader-Meinhof gang was still active, or at least members of
                    it were, even though Baader and Meinhof had been arrested. Some of their
                    adherents were still active. There was a lot of clear sympathy for and support
                    for radical revolutionary groups in the German intellectual class and elite
                    groups. And there was a lot of violence, because there were individuals - not
                    many of these folks - but they were very good at what they did. When I was
                    there, rode up on a motorcycle with a friend one day and machine gunned the
                    solicitor general of the Republic of Germany in the car with his driver. Killed
                    him. Hanns Martin Schleyer who was the head of chamber of commerce was kidnapped
                    and in broad daylight in Cologne by one of these groups and murdered, several
                    weeks later before the federal authorities could find them.</p>
                <p>And the German reaction to this type of terrorism, which was also going on at
                    Italy at the time too, they had Red Brigades and there'd been other groups in
                    Ireland, in Spain, the ETA, these groups seemed to for awhile have a sort of
                    Robin Hood-esque quality to them. They were invincible, the authorities could
                    not catch them, they got bad people who prosecuted left wingers or represented
                    the imperialist class. And it was really difficult for the Germans to come to
                    grips with this. Finally they did catch these people and put them away. But even
                    when they put them away there was trouble because in Stammheim Prison, which is
                    the maximum security prison that was built in Stuttgart in southwest Germany, to
                    take care of these people, to house them, several prisoners were able to
                    coordinate their own suicide on the same night without anybody aware of it or
                    able to stop them. So these suicides raised a great human cry, debates in the
                    Bundestag, demands for investigation, it was really something.</p>
                <p>And there was a lot of interest back here on just what is this going to mean
                    because the German self-confidence seemed to be shaken by all this. They didn't
                    know how to deal with these people even when they captured them. They didn't
                    know how to deal with them: to keep them alive, to prosecute them, to keep them
                    in jail doing their penance, and there was a lot of soul searching and hand
                    wringing about just what all of this meant for the republic of Germany.</p>
                <p>We had to take precaution at the embassy because we were targets too. There was
                    initial surveillance that I knew of, even though I was not in the security or
                    intelligence part of the embassy of the embassy compound. That led us to
                    increase some of our precautions against that. There were later efforts to shoot
                    rockets after I left Bonn. In the early 80s, there was an effort to shoot a
                    rocket into the embassy compound from across the Rhine. I don't recall what
                    happened in that effort but it was made by these groups. They were dangerous
                    people. And there was a concern in some quarters in Germany and in Washington
                    that the government might overreact and impose martial law or the equivalent of
                    it in trying to get the domestic security situation under control.</p>

                <p>At one point after Schleyer was abducted and murdered in a rather grisly fashion
                    and more threats were made there were actually armored vehicles and tanks on the
                    street of Bonn, in the government compound and near the main embassies. And that
                    was a sight that I don't think had ever been seen in Bonn before. It brought
                    back very unpleasant memories of the not-too-distant past. A lot of Germans
                    worried about it. It made the front page of the Times, caused a swath of
                    difficulties for the Germans, internationally, including the United States. So
                    reporting on that and trying to make sense of it in terms of what it really
                    meant to the Germans, how the Germans sized it up, how they were reacting. That
                    was a big part of what I did, and not just what I did but what Dick Smyser the
                    political counselor, Vlad Lehovich my boss, the ambassador, Walt Stoessel and
                    Frank Munoz his DCM and all of us, and the intelligence services too, were all
                    reporting on this with our contacts and from our perspectives. It was a major
                    issue for I'd say most of the '77 - '79 period I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Anything else we should say about Bonn? There was an
                        election in '76 but you weren't in the political section then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you weren't there in the political section for a major
                        election?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No but we certainly followed it. Our son was five years old at the time
                    and we lived in the suburb of Bonn which essentially had garden apartments and a
                    few houses and lots of kids. So even though Ben went to the American school,
                    learned in English, he played in German, with German playmates. So one day he
                    came home singing a song, I forget the tune and I forget the lyrics, but
                    essentially it was an SPD election song, because that part of the Rhineland was
                    very SPD. Very red as they said.</p>
                <p>And so it was an SPD election campaign song against the Americans. So Ben, though
                    he spoke German, didn't quite understand the import of what he was singing
                    although he had the tune down right and he and the kids were singing happily
                    along. So Ann had to explain to him what the song was and when she talked to his
                    friends she said “You really want us to leave?” and they said “No, no no we
                    don't mean you” so they were a little vignettes like that. But that was all
                    personal, not professional and it was not part of the political team.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you had been previously in Cyprus, served in Turkey,
                        and Germans were kind of involved in that part of Europe, during the period
                        you were there. But you weren't involved at all yourself? There was an
                        external part of the political section that did get involved.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Right. Mike ________ and his deputy, they had a two man section also,
                    who covered essentially the foreign ministry. As well as it could be covered by
                    anybody; we had out hands full with the political parties. It was a clear
                    division of labor. We had a two man section for the political military issues
                    liaison with the ministry of defense and to some extent the armed forces. In the
                    last year I was there we got a DOD (Department of Defense) colleague who was
                    detailed to us. A civilian from OSD who was detailed to us to help with the
                    reporting effort. And he reported through embassy channels but this was one of
                    the handful of positions created world wide when SECDEF and SECSTATE agreed to
                    do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And there was somebody in the political section that spent
                        all their time on issues related to Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: There were two people. There was a lawyer, Peter Funge, Jim Whitlock,
                    and a head deputy - there were four people - because the deputy political
                    councilor Bob German did a lot of Berlin, but not exclusively, and there was a
                    political councilor. So we had a fairly extensive section. A number of locals
                    who did translation for us, we had a clipping service, we had a fellow Irving
                    Gross who had a room full of cabinets full of clippings he made, and pasted them
                    in the center of a nice piece of paper with annotations of date and publication.
                    He was a tremendous resource because at the drop of a hat he'd get you
                    biographic information, factual information of what happened when, and gossip
                    information. He was very useful as a resource.</p>
                <p>I had a colleague who took me to the Bundestag. He knew everybody in the
                    Bundestag and everybody knew him and he could open any door there and it was
                    very helpful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned before being present for some of the
                        sessions of the Bundestag. Was that something you did regularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Well the Bundestag met several days most weeks. There was summer breaks
                    and Easter breaks and Christmas breaks but we had the calendar so several days a
                    week they'd be in session. And depending on what the topic was, we would go and
                    sit in the tribunes upstairs and listen to it. This was something I didn't have
                    to do all the time but I enjoyed it, particularly when someone like Strauss was
                    going to speak, or the chancellor, or Willy Brandt who was first rate.</p>
                <p>_____________ was the fellow who had started as a communist, switched over to the
                    SPD after he had a falling out with Stalin and had risen to become the head of
                    the SPD caucus in the Bundestag. And he was called Uncle Herbert, with good
                    reason. He had a vicious temper, and tongue, he didn't hesitate to discipline
                    members who got out of line, and he knew every issue backward and forwards. So
                    nobody was going to cross him.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>But he was also, perhaps with Schmidt and Brandt, the only one in the Bundestag
                    who was as gifted oratorical as Franz Joseph Strauss. And occasionally when they
                    would speak on the same issue, taking entirely different sides, and alluding to
                    each other's position in the most caustic way, it was both a political and
                    rhetorical pleasure just to listen to them go at it. So I enjoyed that very
                    much. It took a lot of time, obviously. There's no speed up on those debates,
                    and they would go on for hours, but I learned a lot about Germany and German
                    politics that way. And I developed tremendous admiration for some of these war
                    horses of the main parties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Bundestag operate through committees? Were you
                        involved with the committees or more with the body as a whole?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Oddly enough I only attended plenary sessions; I could only attend
                    plenary sessions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, Jim you wanted to say a few words about President
                        Carter's visit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Jimmy Carter came to Bonn in the last year we were there. I think it
                    was in the summer. And I was involved in setting up that visit, helping a large
                    team, obviously, do that. It was an interesting visit because it was widely
                    believed and I think with good reason, that Chancellor Schmidt and President
                    Carter did not like each other. You'd read all kinds of gossip in the German
                    papers that obviously came from some source in the federal chancery about
                    Schmidt's acerbic comments one way or the other. But at the end of the day, the
                    visit went, as far as I recall, very well. There were no fireworks. Ann and I
                    were involved in one particular aspect of the visit. Carter, being a very
                    religious man, wanted to attend church services on Sunday and he was there on a
                    Sunday, and it so happened that our community, the American community in
                    Plittersdorf, had an American church built in New England style with a steeple,
                    white wood and brick. Ann and I were regular members of the congregation and we
                    were part of the liaison team with Russ Montfort the minister to make sure the
                    visit went well. Basically, Carter came in, sat down through the whole service,
                    and then went out and shook hands with the congregation after it was over. It
                    was a very nice service, I forget what the sermon was, but everybody was very
                    happy, the church was packed to the rafters which it wasn't always.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes he reads the scripture or even gives the
                        lesson.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I don't think he had any role as I recall. He came in and sat down and
                    Ann was in one of the back rows and some fellow with a huge satchel came in and
                    sat down next to her and she was very aware of security and had no idea who this
                    guy was. He was in civilian dress and he had a satchel which was bulging. She
                    didn't know what in the hell it was, and finally she nudged somebody from the
                    Secret Service from our own security office and said what is this guy with his
                    bag over here. It was the President's physician with his medicaments Carter
                    might have needed. Carter didn't need any medication.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought you were going to say it was the nuclear
                        codes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, it wasn't the package; this was a doctor as it turned out. Carter,
                    who has wonderful interpersonal skills, and Mrs. Carter, and Amy who was there,
                    spent a lot of time shaking hands with the congregation. Amy at one point took
                    our daughter Laura's hand and walked with her around a bit, we have a picture of
                    that. And years later when I was in Athens and President and Mrs. Carter came
                    there for another reason, we showed them that picture of Amy and Laura from Bonn
                    in the late '70s and they autographed it for us. We reminisced a bit about the
                    visit, so that was a lot of fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright, anything else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Well a big part of my off-duty time in Bonn was the tennis committee of
                    the American Club on the Rhine. The whole time we had an embassy in Bonn and had
                    the residential area in Plittersdorf we had essentially a country club which was
                    part of that Plittersdorf complex which had swimming pool and tennis courts, and
                    for the last two or three years of my tour in Bonn I was the chairman of the
                    tennis committee which meant setting up tennis tournaments, sometimes
                    officiating at, in which I discovered the hard way is a lot more difficult than
                    it looks on TV. Making line calls that the players don't like is not always
                    easy. But it was quite an education in how to run a committee, how to set up a
                    banquet where the ambassador came, because he was an avid tennis player, and
                    Mrs. Stoessel was too. That added to the overall pleasure that we had. I think
                    from the point of view of the overall enjoyment of the whole family I guess the
                    total experience professional and personal, Bonn would be one of the top parts
                    of our Foreign Service career. That was great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Being involved with the tennis committee sounds better,
                        I've done a number of these oral history interviews where there was an
                        experience being a member of the school board of the American school and
                        that was often very difficult and heavy responsibility. This sounded like
                        very responsible and some difficulty, but probably a lot of fun too.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: There was rarely difficulty. The only problem we had was a rather
                    embarrassing one. As I said we had an annual banquet to award trophies to those
                    who'd won the club tournament in various divisions, and the first year I did
                    that I assumed that the staff from the club would have the names engraved
                    properly on the trophies, but when I made the awards I discovered that virtually
                    every name had been misspelled. So I had to make the presentations and then go
                    back after the ceremony and get the trophies back to have the name plates done
                    correctly. After that, we checked the names before they went to the
                    engraver.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, you left Bonn in '79, where did you go then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Left in '79, at this point I'd been abroad since '76; I'd been out of
                    real work in Washington since '72 when I started Greek language training. I had
                    a chance to go to Prague as DCM. I hope I'm not being indiscrete in revealing
                    that Frank Meehan who had been designated the ambassador in Prague wanted me to
                    do that, or was kind enough to ask me to do that. Frank may have appreciated
                    much better than I did the difficulties that would cause, because as I said I
                    had no real sub-seventh floor experience in the department at that point and
                    even worse I was one grade junior for the job, so it was a stretch. The system
                    said no despite Frank's best efforts. I felt wonderful, flattered by being asked
                    by that fellow because he was such a phenomenal person as well as a
                    representative of our country, but it didn't work out that we went to Prague. It
                    was probably for the best I have to say, although at the time I was a bit sore
                    that Washington didn't see the wisdom of Ambassador Meehan's choice. He got a
                    very fine DCM as it turned out, Byron Morton, who was of grade, and actually I
                    think had served in Eastern Europe before. So we came back to Washington and I
                    was assigned to EUR/SE.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>I was assigned to be the Cyprus desk officer in EUR/SE, the Office of Southern
                    European Affairs. Ed Dillery was in charge of it and Bob Pugh, later Geoff Ogden
                    was the deputy. There were two Turkish desk officers, two Greek desk officers,
                    and one Cyprus desk officer, two people in the front office of SC and then
                    several secretaries. This was my first real experience working in the Department
                    of State below the seventh floor. Up on the seventh floor I'd done essentially
                    staff work, asking others for something, telling others what to do, but I'd
                    never really done what I would call serious work at the country officer level.
                    And as I had served in Cyprus I knew quite a bit about it at that time and it
                    was not hard to pick up the portfolio for Cyprus and EUR/SE. One of the first
                    issues we had to deal with was whether to allow into the United States for
                    medical treatment Nicos Sampson who had been installed by the junta as the
                    president of Cyprus when Makarios had escaped by the skin of his teeth and with
                    his life in 1974. Sampson at the time the request was pending was suffering from
                    a horribly debilitating disease which is caused by parasites that get into your
                    system and cause enormous benign tumors in all parts of the body including the
                    vital organs, the heart and so forth. It was not so much disfiguring as
                    disabling and very painful, and it does sooner or later lead to death. So we
                    apparently had some treatment or treatment centers in America that could handle
                    this disease and his other ailments. And as I recall, Kyprianou the president of
                    Cyprus, asked us to let him in. I wrote a memo to George Vest, this was the
                    first thing I ever wrote I think for SE. Basically saying that we don't owe
                    anybody this favor, that Sampson could get treatment in France where he was
                    staying or somewhere else. He was kind of a Flying Dutchman at that point. He
                    hadn't yet been allowed to go back to Cyprus, he was clearly sick, but just as
                    clearly there were other treatment centers available, so my recommendation was
                    no. Ed signed it off, it went up. I don't recall what the final decision was,
                    but this experience on the desk brought me into very close contact with members
                    of the Cyprus embassy. Some of them I saw later when they were in Bonn, Andreas
                    Nicolaides was briefly in the embassy in Washington but went later to Bonn as
                    ambassador.</p>

                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Came back as ambassador to Washington, then he was ambassador in Bonn,
                    and I saw him in Bonn when I was passing through once or twice as coordinator. I
                    enjoy working with the Cyprus embassy folk. To some extent I dealt with the
                    Greek and Turkish embassy although not quite so much for obvious reasons, but
                    just learning how the bureaucracy works in terms of the budget cycle, in terms
                    of the aid requests, in terms of the importance and the power of the domestic
                    groups that are concerned with Cyprus and Greece. Everything from AHEPA to the
                    Pan-Cypriot Federation and the other groups that were around at the time. We saw
                    them all and quite a bit of some of them. I think I only spent about five months
                    on the Cyprus desk. It was a busy time. The Kyprianou/Sampson issue sticks out
                    in my mind as the main thing. There were probably some others. But the Turkish
                    desk had a sudden vacancy. Having also served in Turkey and realizing that that
                    was a bigger job because it had a secretary and a deputy, I applied for it and I
                    moved over. And for the next two and a half years I was the senior Turkish desk
                    officer in SE. It was a very busy time for reasons of military aid, economic
                    aid, the effort to stabilize the economy of Turkey, periodic rumblings about the
                    military. There was a coup in 1980 and there was terrorism. The first thing I
                    had to deal with when I moved over, and it was December of '79, it was the
                    immediate aftermath of the assassination of four American contractors in
                    Istanbul by Dev Sol or one of the leftist Turkish terrorist groups. These people
                    were somewhat similar to Baader Meinhof, left wing in orientation, highly
                    organized, compartmentalized, very ideological, and they had enough bench
                    strength so that even when the Turkish police rolled up some of their cells,
                    there were others to do the work. So the quick issue I had to deal with was the
                    assassination of these four contractors and what that meant or didn't mean for
                    the bilateral relationship.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One issue that I'd like to hear what you have to say on,
                        and I don't want to take things out of sequence, but at the time of the
                        military takeover in 1980 and there had been terrorism, there was lots of
                        concern about the situation in Turkey, do you want to say what you remember
                        about that event and the U.S. reaction to it. It was late in the Carter
                        administration. Were we terribly upset that the military demolished the
                        democratic process in Turkey and so on? Maybe talk a little bit about the
                        period before it too.</hi>

                <p>WILLIAMS: There was a steady worsening of the domestic situation in Turkey
                    starting in the late '70s when S�leyman Demirel came back to power. It wasn't
                    because it was Demirel but it was just because these left wing terrorist groups
                    were getting out of hand in the sense they were killing more and more people and
                    creating more and more sense of panic and disorder in Turkey. This unease of
                    course was noticed by the Turkish military which historically has viewed itself
                    and been viewed by the Turkish people as the guardian of the Ataturk legacy. The
                    situation affected schools, it affected universities, it affected economic
                    areas. There was hardly an area of Turkish life that was not to some extent
                    compromised by this terrorism. Just one personal comment: our language teachers
                    from Ankara who had taught Ann and me Turkish in the late '60s left Turkey at
                    that time in '79 and came to the States. They left essentially because they were
                    worried about their children. It was so unsafe. Even their young child who was
                    in primary school, the primary schools were not entirely safe from the random
                    violence or the targeted violence of the terrorist groups. It was a time of
                    tremendous unease and danger for many people. Turks in the cities especially.
                    Much less so in the countryside. I don't recall if martial law was used in that
                    period, though in some provinces for much of the '80s and '90s martial law was
                    in effect. There was no Kurdish issue at this time. This was not an issue of
                    Kurdish separatism or Kurdish unrest at all. This was an issue of left wing
                    anarchistic terror against the state and against the Turkish people. Against
                    that background I, by sheer dumb luck, happened to be in Ankara on consultations
                    September 11 or 12, whatever day it was 1980 when the coup happened. I was
                    staying at the residence and Ambassador Spain knocked on my door early that
                    morning and said I could sleep in and take my time because we wouldn't be going
                    down to the embassy for a while, there had been a coup. But when we did go down
                    the hill from �ankaya where the residence is located, to the embassy, there were
                    no cars in the streets, there was a tank here or there, but there were a lot of
                    people walking around and they looked quite happy and relaxed. This is Ankara
                    now, I'm not going to generalize beyond that, but it was a pretty big hunk of
                    people, looked quite pleased that the military, thank God, had arrived to put
                    things right. Relieved and happy. We didn't interview them, this is a very
                    impressionistic statement, and could be challenged by people who looked at it
                    more scientifically, but the sense was, and this was also the sense that other
                    people on the country team had, of relief that at last the Turkish military had
                    acted and stepped in and would impose order and bring the terrorists under
                    control. As I recall, that's pretty much what happened. They did use martial
                    law; they did bring the terrorism under control. They did set in motion, largely
                    prodded by us, a process to restore democracy, but with a constitution that gave
                    the military tremendously central importance in national security and main
                    affairs of state. Our reaction in Washington was certainly not one of
                    condemnation. I think there was a lot of understanding and sympathy for what the
                    Turks had been going through, and given the fact that the military had already
                    overrun the government several times before, and had restored democracy, there
                    was a reasonable expectation that it would do so again. I remember Larry
                    Eagleburger was the assistant secretary for EUR soon after this happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not until 1981. He was ambassador to Yugoslavia at the
                        time. George Vest was assistant secretary during this period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I distinctly remember meeting with Eagleburger. I'm confusing my dates
                    perhaps, but essentially Ambassador Elekdag who was the Turkish ambassador for
                    many years in Washington came in with his talking cards. He always had his
                    points on three by five or four by seven cards and started making excuses,
                    explaining how democracy would soon be restored. And it was either Eagleburger
                    or Secretary Haig or both who in effect said don't worry about that, we
                    understand what you did and we understand that you have a plan to in effect
                    restore democracy when conditions are right. So there was no real pressure from
                    Washington as far as I can recall, despite the official tut-tutting about what
                    happened to democracy. But there was a deep understanding for the reasons it had
                    happened and as I said a reasonable expectation that the Turkish military would
                    restore both order and democracy in due course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What you just said is basically my recollection as well. I
                        happened to be in Bonn at the time on September 12th I think it was of 1980
                        and had arrived I think from Berlin the night before and was staying at the
                        DCM's residence and was quite surprised at breakfast to find out what had
                        happened in Turkey, and then Jack Seymour came to pick me up and we went
                        over to the foreign ministry. Of course, with the time difference with
                        Washington it was a little hard to consult with people, but the German
                        foreign ministry was very interested in what our reaction would probably be,
                        and I think as I recall describing it more or less along the lines of what
                        you just said. That yes, we always preferred democracy, but we were
                        confident and things had gotten very bad in Turkey and this was not a big
                        surprise and we would probably be somewhat understanding of it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I recall now the specific issue with Secretary Haig. I had conflated
                    two meetings. When Haig became Secretary of State early in '81, this would have
                    been the end of January, early February. Early in his tenure, Elekdag came up
                    for a meeting and in that meeting, his first with the new Secretary of State of
                    the new administration, Elekdag started to explain how the Turkish military
                    planned to restore democracy, anticipating that this is what his audience would
                    want to hear. My deputy was in that meeting, Larry Benedict I think it was.
                    Larry said it was quite striking. Before Elekdag could get through one card, and
                    he had quite a few of them, Haig essentially cut him off and said don't worry
                    about it, we trust you. And Elekdag was very surprised because he'd been
                    expecting to get a little more effusive encouragement to go back to democracy.
                    Haig, having dealt with the Turkish military as NATO Commander and intimately
                    involved in some of their dealings with the Greeks and the effort to bring
                    Greece back into the military wing of NATO, Haig knew these folks, General Ebren
                    and the others, and had full confidence in them. He wanted to assure Elekdag he
                    didn't need to go through the motions of talking about restoration of democracy.
                    So he didn't. Elekdag talked about something else.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the other issues that you dealt with as
                        country director for Turkey in this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Turkish aid levels were a hardy perennial. I never did learn our own
                    budget cycle very well. I remember that Eric Grayfelt who coordinated these
                    things for the various desks in EUR would come by; it seemed earlier and earlier
                    each year, with a request to start jetting up papers for presentation. How much
                    money for economic assistance, how much for military assistance. The Turkish
                    debt issue was a constant problem. My deputy tended to cover this more than I
                    did, but as I recall there were several efforts by the Paris club to reschedule
                    Turkish debt which had been done before. We crossed a new threshold however when
                    we rescheduled already once before rescheduled debt from previously rescheduled
                    debt. So PRD, previously rescheduled debt, rescheduling became the watch word
                    and we had a lot of meetings with Elekdag on doing that. I think at the end of
                    the day we did it. I don't remember the numbers, but because of Turkey's central
                    importance to us, to the alliance, to that part of the Mediterranean, those
                    strategic considerations overrode shall we say financial orthodoxy and I think
                    the trade treaty went along finally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I recall, one of the reasons why we were as confident
                        of Turkey and what the military would do was that they retained Turgut Ozal
                        as kind of the chief economic officer as he had been in previous government.
                        And I know I had some meetings with him in Paris and in Washington. Do you
                        remember anything about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Just that he was retained and that was an important element of
                    continuity and as you say confidence. Demirel had installed him as an economic
                    advisor with some power. I think those powers in his portfolio were enhanced
                    significantly when the military came in, but I had no particular dealings with
                    him, unfortunately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: U.S. military facilities in Turkey had presumably gone
                        back into operation, back to normal, after the congressional Turkish arms
                        embargo was lifted in '78. Were you involved in status of forces
                        negotiations or any kind of base negotiations with Turkey?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Not really. Don Gelber as I recall was our main negotiator for the
                    Defense and Economic Cooperation Agreement, the DECA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he was in the embassy at Ankara at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Was in the embassy at the time and came back regularly which is where
                    I'm at, to debrief essentially. But that was handled on a different level. I'm
                    sure Ed and probably Bob Pugh and Geoff Ogden were much more involved than I
                    was. But I did not do base negotiations directly. I do remember the debriefs
                    which were extensive and I seem to recall that that DECA was used as the model
                    for the Greek DECA. There were two DECAs were there not in that period?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were, in parallel more or less. Any other issues
                        with Turkey that you were...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Economic assistance I mentioned, military assistance. The Turks had a
                    charming way through Ambassador Elekdag in particular, voicing their expectation
                    that you would give them certain amounts, and it was put in the declarative
                    sense which did not go down well initially with those that did not know the
                    Turks. But in fact they got substantial assistance from us in those years. One
                    year we actually gave them more than they had asked for. I don't remember why.
                    And they never made that mistake again. They constantly upped the ante so we are
                    always under their expectations and therefore we were in the position of owing
                    them something by their lights. It sounds like I'm making fun of them, and I am
                    to a certain degree, but I thoroughly enjoyed working with the Turkish embassy.
                    It was a very professional group. Elekdag was one of the best ambassadors I've
                    ever seen in any country. I think his tenure here was very successful. There was
                    one issue too which I should mention, which sounds like I'm echoing my Bonn
                    comments, but it's true, that is terrorism which I started to mention before.
                    Terrorism was of course a concern in Turkey. Unfortunately on my watch it became
                    a concern in the United States with respect to Turkish diplomats. I think in the
                    early '70s a deranged elderly Armenian in California had murdered two Turkish
                    consuls in their office and he was I believe a survivor of the Armenian genocide
                    or the son of somebody who had survived it, but had very direct memories of that
                    experience. And this had never happened before, and we were shocked and the
                    Turks were shocked. As I recall that old man was sent to jail for the rest of
                    his life. For whatever reason, at this point I can't remember what the reason
                    was, the Armenian community in the third generation in the States, members of it
                    was radicalized in the late '70s and there was a group called ASALA, the secret
                    army for the liberation of Armenia. There were two essentially Armenian groups
                    with terrorist wings in the United States. One of them assassinated a Turkish
                    consul general and his driver I believe in Los Angeles when I was a desk
                    officer, and this fellow was caught, his name was Sosoonian. He was caught
                    rather quickly; he was prosecuted and sent to life in prison. I think he's still
                    there. That search, that prosecution, that trial, that conviction, were very
                    closely watched by the Turks as an indication of how seriously we took the
                    problem of terrorism that affected them. We worked out a system that was
                    followed so closely, this was before e-mail. Our embassy had to have almost day
                    to day real time input to keep up with the Turks who were getting it from their
                    people in Washington and out in California about what was going on with the
                    trial. I forget how we did it exactly, but somehow we got daily reports from the
                    courtroom or from lawyers following the case for us. We didn't have Greta Van
                    Susteren but we had somebody talking to us who was a lawyer who could give us a
                    sense of things. Maybe somebody in the Justice Department. And I would then send
                    an official and formal night note to Dick Bone the DCM in Ankara to give him the
                    latest up to date. There was no CNN; there was no broadcast coverage that would
                    compete with that. So he had by the next morning more information than anybody
                    else in the embassy probably and certainly enough to deal with the Turks in the
                    foreign ministry who were hammering on us daily about what are you going to do
                    about Sosoonian, what are you going to do about Sosoonian. That we hoped would
                    be the end of it. Unfortunately, about a year later, another Turk was killed in
                    Boston. This was the honorary consul. I forget the name. But he was killed by an
                    Armenian, third generation from the genocide. I don't know the name this time.
                    But that person too was caught and convicted and sent to jail. Once again
                    demarches by the Turkish ambassador had to be dealt with, demarches in Ankara
                    had to be dealt with, and real time information on the status of the trial. So
                    that took a lot of time. And there was another component to it because the Turks
                    quite rightly said and our own people in DS (Diplomatic security) concluded that
                    the Turks had other enemies too. A Cypriot once tried something just after the
                    Cyprus disaster of '74. So there were various groups of people in this country
                    and elsewhere who would try to get them. There was also a serious case of
                    Armenian terrorism against Turks in Europe. In Vienna, in Paris and elsewhere
                    they were successful in assassinating Turkish ambassadors and other officials.
                    So the Turks were in a sort of understandable paranoia about what this meant and
                    they were demanding all kinds of protection. And we as a matter of prudence
                    thought it necessary to give them some extra protection. And that came down to
                    the issue which is where I was so heavily involved with DS and the treasury, of
                    installing fixed posts at the Turkish embassy and to some extent to Turkish
                    consular positions in the United States. The Treasury ran the uniformed division
                    of the Secret Service and that was the body in Washington tasked with providing
                    fixed posts. It's something that no security service likes to do because it's
                    very manpower intensive. It's 24 hours a day, just chews up people. It's seven
                    days a week. And the initial reaction was no, no, no, but we kept going back to
                    them and then we finally overruled the Secret Service. I think it required the
                    Deputy Secretary of State talking to his colleague in Treasury before it was
                    finally done. When the dam was broken we got the fixed post at the Turkish
                    embassy and I think it's still there. I think DS might have had to do this at
                    their consulates elsewhere in the United States, so that was visible, tangible
                    proof of our seriousness about terrorism and our determination to give the Turks
                    some extra protection. A lot of people said at the time, and this may be true,
                    that's not the most efficient use of manpower in terms of combating terrorism.
                    On the other hand, it's a very basic part of reassuring the protectee that
                    you're serious and that he can do his work normally. So getting that done I
                    think was probably the largest single issue I had on my last year on the desk
                    there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Besides the tragic incidents of Turkish diplomats being
                        killed by terrorists there certainly over the years has been pressure by the
                        Armenian American community and Armenians elsewhere to encourage Turkey to
                        accept responsibility for what happened in 1915. Congressional resolutions,
                        something at the Holocaust Museum. Did that sort of thing come up while you
                        were on the desk, or was that later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It was always there. It was part of the discussion because as soon as
                    you start talking about Armenian terrorism the reasons for it come up and the
                    past is dredged out, and the obstinate refusal of the Turkish governments to
                    open the archives or to even express regret let alone apologize was always,
                    always there. But I would say that the political discussion on this subject was
                    virulent at the time because of the murders. I mean that made it difficult to
                    have a dispassionate discussion with the Turks, or even with some of the
                    Armenian American leadership about what was involved in the Turkish
                    relationship. I remember, and there was a lot of pressure against Turkey, and
                    justifiable pressure, for its refusal to come clean or to open the archives or
                    to allow a dispassionate examination of the record. The Republic of Turkey was
                    the legal successor to the Ottoman government and the government in power in
                    World War I, and it certainly was not responsible for what had been done. But it
                    seemed to take the position, and I think this is the case of many Turkish
                    governments and maybe to this day, that if you accept responsibility by saying
                    you're sorry, you open yourself up to potential claims for reparations either
                    monetary or territory or both and they just didn't want to go down that road
                    because that would be domestically difficult in Turkey. I had several
                    experiences with this and I lost a few feathers in both. One of our efforts to
                    promote the bilateral relationship, which I saw as one of my duties on the
                    Turkish desk, was to host or to have the Turkish folkloric ballet perform in the
                    United States. This was something that USIS (United States Information Service)
                    had scheduled, it was cultural exchange. This was the national folkloric ballet
                    of Turkey doing essentially folk dances which are not unlike those you see in
                    Greece and other parts of the Middle East, Cyprus. But they were Turks and they
                    were doing Turkish dances, and their name was Turkish Folkloric Ballet. The
                    impresario initially scheduled them to do four appearances in California, I
                    think a couple in Chicago, New York, Boston, and finally in the Kennedy Center
                    at Washington. The pressure from the Armenian American community and other
                    communities against those appearances was so great that one by one the insurers
                    started threatening to cancel their policies and the owners of the theaters and
                    the other establishments started backing out. We couldn't obviously tell any of
                    these folks what to do as the Department of State, but we thought it important
                    to appeal to the political leadership in California at least to try to let this
                    performance go forward on the grounds of cultural exchange and not to give into
                    terrorism as we would do. This type of political pressure as we put it, we
                    didn't call it terrorism outright. So I, as full of my enthusiasm as I always
                    was, drafted a set of I thought very persuasive talking points for the deputy
                    secretary. The secretary was not available and Larry Eagleburger didn't want to
                    bother him, but for Judge Clark, Deputy Secretary, to use with the Governor of
                    California who as luck would have it was named Deukmejian.</p>

                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Clark was a Californian and knew his way around politics there. He
                    might not know much about foreign policy but his mother had raised no fool when
                    it came to domestic policy and politics. He understood that very well. In any
                    case, we did the talking points. This was an important issue because the Turkish
                    ambassador had been demarching all over town about it. The Turks had been raised
                    with our embassy in Ankara, and as a matter of principle we really felt the
                    Turkish Folkloric Ballet should be allowed to perform. But both the cities of
                    Los Angeles and San Francisco and the local backers had said no. The proposal
                    was that Judge Clark call George Deukmejian, Governor Deukmejian and make the
                    case on political grounds. To use suasion with his community, with his people in
                    California, all Californians, to let these performances go ahead. I was asked to
                    join Larry Eagleburger in Judge Clark's office. Never met Judge Clark before
                    though I'd heard a lot about him. So Larry gave him the memo. I don't think the
                    judge had read it. He told the judge in several senses what it was about and
                    gave him the memo, and Clark had the call put through to Governor Deukmejian. I
                    was sitting there taking notes because I thought that was my responsibility.
                    Judge Clark picks up the phone, talks to the governor, had a little small talk,
                    and then he says to the governor, there's one of my people here who wants to
                    raise an issue with you, at which point he hands the phone to me. So I get on
                    the phone. There was no warning on this. I was coming into the conversation
                    cold, and Deukmejian, I don't know if he knew what the subject was or not
                    because Clark had certainly given him no indication of what it was. So I start
                    reading my own talking points to the governor of California and there was
                    silence. I don't know how he looked or what he was doing or who else was on the
                    line, but I went through all my talking points and asked for his cooperation as
                    I thought Judge Clark was going to do. And as I recall, Deukmejian was courteous
                    but he basically said he resented this effort to tell the people of California
                    how to think about Turkey and what to do about the ballet, and that he just
                    didn't think he could do anything about it or words to that effect. So that was
                    the bottom line. So I felt like a stupid fool because I thought I'd wasted my
                    time and his and Judge Clark's. But it was a lesson to me also in how things
                    worked and how Murphy's Law can occur. So at the end of the day the appearances
                    were all canceled except for the Kennedy Center, which did go on. That was the
                    only one. Every other one the impresario backed out because the insurance
                    wouldn't cover it, or the owners of the theater didn't want to put their
                    facilities at risk for riot or bombing or incident or unfavorable publicity.
                    There was just too much downside potential to the entrepreneurs and private
                    sector and public sector folk. After this fiasco with Governor Deukmejian, I
                    called in my capacity as senior Turkish desk officer in the Department of State,
                    then Mayor Diane Feinstein of San Francisco, and asked her to be helpful,
                    figuring that with a name like that she would perhaps be more inclined to be
                    helpful. I would say she engaged more on the issue and professed sympathy, but
                    also told me very clearly there was nothing she could do to overrule that
                    decision or to resist the pressures for the decision to cancel the Turkish
                    Folkloric Ballet. So even I struck out. But the performance in the Kennedy
                    Center, perhaps for all these reasons, was well-attended. The concert hall was
                    full. It was an enthusiastic audience; it was a stellar performance of folkloric
                    dance. This was really impressive, the costuming, the agility, the grace of
                    these dancers. And as it was their only appearance in a program that initially
                    called for eight or 10 performances across the whole country, we wanted to make
                    it special and they did too. And it was a very magical evening. But I'll never
                    cease regretting that we couldn't do better on that cultural field, but again it
                    was a lesson on how things work. You can't treat culture or politics or anything
                    in isolation. It all is ultimately subject to other concerns.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to come back for just a second to the aid levels
                        for Turkey. One of the things I don't think you mentioned and maybe we
                        should say just a word about is this whole question of the ten to seven
                        ratio that Turkey would receive ten dollars and Greece would receive seven.
                        No matter what the Turkish level was, that also set the Greek level. That
                        might have been the case in the time that they got more than the Turks had
                        asked for, that really Greece wanted more and therefore we wound up giving
                        more to Turkey than they had asked for. Do you remember much about the ratio
                        and how that came to be and how important that was at the time you were on
                        the desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Well it was important because the Turks resented the hell out of it and
                    they were very up front in telling us that. They essentially saw the ten to
                    seven ratio, which was an undertaking reached in the negotiation of the Greek
                    version of the Defense and Economic Cooperation Agreement, as a brake on their
                    ability to milk us for resources. The Greeks were not trying to push their
                    levels up because they understood correctly that their lower level could push
                    the Turkish levels down. The Turks argued that their needs, which were so far
                    greater than those of the Greeks, were not being met adequately by us because of
                    the braking effect of ten to seven. So it was a constant element of resentment
                    in the discussion. That's the main thing I remember about it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've talked about the Turkish embassy in Washington,
                        Ambassador Elekdag, why don't you talk a little bit about your relations,
                        how you handled Ambassador Jim Spain and then Ambassador Robert Strausz-Hupe
                        who I think became ambassador while you were on the desk.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Jim Spain was my first ambassador. Ron Spiers had just left. Dennis Kux
                    was the charg� for a while. We were involved in getting Jim Spain confirmed and
                    sent out to Ankara. As it turned out he was virtually a lame duck because when
                    the Republicans won, Strausz-Hupe was tapped to be the next ambassador to
                    Turkey. And I don't recall how long Jim Spain's tour was. But the issue with
                    Spain in which I was only slightly involved was his confirmation. He had had an
                    earlier career as an analyst for the CIA and there was some concern in
                    Washington that if the Turks found out about this it might prejudice his success
                    as chief of mission in Ankara. It might even lead them to deny his appointment.
                    So there was a lot of discussion about it. Spain mentions in his memoir even, I
                    think it was finally resolved when Warren Christopher, the Deputy Secretary of
                    State, was persuaded to call Ambassador Elekdag and over the phone discuss
                    Ambassador Spain's biography to see if any neuralgic reaction occurred. At the
                    end of the day the Turks said fine, come ahead as I recall. It was not a
                    problem. But for a while in Washington we thought it would be.</p>

                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: He'd been DCM. But that had not come up. This was in context of his
                    confirmation and that was the concern. No, he'd had a very successful tour as
                    DCM and knew Turkey well. So that was the main thing. I stayed with him once
                    when I was there on consultations. That was during the coup of the fall of 1980.
                    He was heavily involved in pushing the idea of a... the question was how could
                    America best commemorate the centennial of Mustafa Kemal Atat�rk's birth which
                    was a very big issue in Turkey, but understandably not in many other countries
                    and certainly not in the United States of America. And we discussed a lot of
                    things, from a postage stamp to this, that or the other. I think in the end it
                    was a very modest commemoration and I don't recall what it was, but Jim had a
                    lot of ideas on that as he did on many things. And we tried all of them
                    including the stamp, but discovered that the lead time for stamps is pretty long
                    unless you're a former President of the United States. Again the politics of it
                    was such it was clear we could not get a stamp through the Citizen's Advisory
                    Committee even with enough lead time. There was some work with Jim as I recall,
                    but I don't remember much more than that. Then when Ambassador Strausz-Hupe came
                    he was in no great hurry to get out which surprised me a bit. He spent a fair
                    amount of time consulting to Washington. As with Jim Spain I had a good
                    relationship with Ambassador Strausz-Hupe. We made heavy use of the OI channel
                    and less of the phone to keep each other informed officially in the formal
                    channel. The only difficulty I had with him sometimes was that he had a habit of
                    going out in a rather proconsul-like fashion giving press conferences. This was
                    under the military government, giving press conferences on issues for which we
                    had not had a chance to prepare him. Sometimes he would put his foot in it
                    because he was uninformed so we had to help him walk that particular cat back.
                    But that was the main issue I had with him.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay we're continuing the foreign affairs Oral History
                        interview with James A. Williams. It's the 4th of November 2004. And Jim, I
                        think we're just about finished with your period at the Turkish desk, which
                        ended about 1982. Was there any sort of last words you'd like to make about
                        that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Well that was my three year tour on the desk. I'd been the desk officer
                    for Cyprus and then most of the time for Turkey. I think it was a wonderful
                    introduction to how the bureaucracy works, the budget process in terms of the
                    military, and the economic assistance request clearance issues and so forth. And
                    that was a very useful lesson for me, a very intense one, but I enjoyed it
                    enormously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, and where did you go from the southern European office
                        of the European bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I convinced myself I was suffering from burnout and I needed to do
                    something different. And so I had heard for years from friends about the virtues
                    of taking a year off at the National War College or similar institution and I
                    thought that would be a good way to decompress from EUR/SE and look around for
                    something else. So I applied for National War College training and was fortunate
                    enough to get it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think in this oral history program we've had lots of
                        people that have described the National War College as a State Department
                        student. Is there anything particularly that strikes you from your year that
                        you'd want to talk about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Well, it was a very different era. There was no degree program at the
                    National War College. Essentially you could do as much or, for many, as little
                    as you wanted in a course of study there. Two semesters. And it was a chance to
                    really broaden yourself or just do something totally different. Many people made
                    different choices and they were all apparently good choices. I found my
                    classmates, certainly from the State Department contingent, but more
                    particularly from the larger military contingents, to be quite impressive, with
                    very different experiences in Vietnam in particular, but not just there. And so
                    I think in terms of the cross-fertilization of the civilian and military
                    components of government it was a very useful experience for all of us. As there
                    was no final exam, no semester exam, no term paper until the end, no degree
                    program, there was really no academic pressure to do all the heavy reading which
                    was indeed very heavy, about 1,000 pages a week as I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What trip did you take in the spring?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Oh yes, one of the big attractions to the year at the War College was
                    the famous trip. I got Spain, Portugal, Gibraltar, Algeria and Morocco. Actually
                    I think we did it in that order. And it was a great time because I had never
                    been to any of those places before. It had been years since anybody from the
                    National War College in that capacity had been to Algeria. We were the first
                    group since I think relations had been severed in the '67 war. They treated us
                    very well, gave us excellent briefings. It was a good learning experience, also
                    good cultural experience. We bonded well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was probably in part possible in 1983 because of the
                        strong role that the Algerians had played in ending the Tehran hostage
                        crisis at the beginning of 1981. Did you finish your point about
                        Algeria?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: That may well have been the decisive factor. We were never told what
                    the reason really was, except that the Algerians wanted a better relationship
                    with us and this was one way of showing it, and we wanted a better relationship
                    with them. There was no terrorism in Algiers at the time. We didn't go outside
                    of the capital city. I must say the briefings they gave us which were usually in
                    French but translated were very high quality. They seemed to go out of their way
                    to do well by us since they were aware we were the first National War College
                    team to come there to their country in 15, 20 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, so you finished the National War College, where then
                        did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I still wanted to be in Washington and looked at a number of jobs in
                    Washington. On the German desk in particular I was hung up for much of my career
                    with the idea that I should be a German affairs expert. Sometimes I succeeded,
                    sometimes I didn't. This time I did not. But my former boss from EUR/SE, Ed
                    Dillery, had been meanwhile moved over to lead the Office of United Nations
                    Political Affairs, IOUNP in bureaucratese, and offered me a chance to come over
                    as his deputy, succeeding Phil Wilcox. And so that wasn't my first choice for
                    reasons I've stated, but it turned out to be a very good choice when I went over
                    in the summer of 1983.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So I know that IOUNP deals with political issues in the
                        United Nations system and sends instructions to the U.S. representative to
                        the United Nations who I think was Jeane Kirkpatrick at the time. Tell us a
                        little bit about what your responsibilities in that office were, and what
                        kind of issues did you deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I was the deputy, but brand new to UN affairs in every respect. I'd
                    only worked on multilateral issues in my foreign service career through a sort
                    of bilateral focus, how the Germans were feeling about things, how the Turks
                    were feeling about things, but I'd never done multilateral issues per se so I
                    had a lot to learn. One of the things we did as you said was to send
                    instructions to USUN, our United Nations mission, on how to vote on issues in
                    the Security Council primarily, but also in the general assembly. Jeane
                    Kirkpatrick was our permanent representative at the time, and she really did not
                    like getting instructions that she had not approved. So, in effect we
                    pre-cleared her instructions in the back channel, and when she said it was
                    alright to “instruct” her in that way we sent the cable front channel. That was
                    a learning experience too, so I think it's safe to say that Ambassador
                    Kirkpatrick, by the time I got there, never received an instruction in the front
                    channel she didn't like and if she got one in the back channel it never saw the
                    light of day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was an office in the State Department sort of
                        connecting her to the State Department, I guess working for her. How did you
                        interact with that office?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Quite closely. The office of the permanent representative in those days
                    was right across the hall from IOUNP so it was not uncommon for Alan Gerson who
                    was one of her close collaborators or Harvey Feldman to come down from New York,
                    spend a few days there, and then regularly every few hours walk across to talk
                    to us about an issue. Often a Middle Eastern issue which was something about
                    which they were very concerned because in those days, even more so than today, a
                    large number of resolutions in the general assembly and a large number of issues
                    in the security council concerned Israel, or more particularly, efforts to
                    stigmatize Israel, or demonize Israel, one way or the other. And they were very
                    diligent in working with us and with NEA and other parts of the State Department
                    to make sure we had the appropriate response.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the assistant secretary and the deputy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The assistant secretary when I got there was Gregory Newell who at that
                    time was the youngest assistant secretary ever in IO and perhaps in the
                    Department of State. He was barely 30 years old. He'd come over from the White
                    House as an advance man, a prot�g�e of Mike Deaver. Very meticulous,
                    hard-working guy. He was, however, sort of a Johnny One Note. Being very
                    politically attuned, he had sized up the situation with respect to UNESCO even
                    before he came over. He had decided the way to make his mark was to take the
                    United States demonstratively out of UNESCO because of the corruption and
                    alleged incompetence of the then Secretary General of UNESCO. M'Bow was from
                    Senegal. There was no question that M'Bow was incompetent and UNESCO had done
                    things it shouldn't have done in a budgetary sense. Still, it caused quite a
                    stir for the United States to walk out of UNESCO, having done the same thing
                    with regard to the ILO a few years before. And a large part of our first year
                    was spent explaining that decision to other countries. At one point I
                    accompanied Greg Newell as sort of his note taker and bag carrier on a trip to a
                    number of countries in the Middle East, including Iraq where we went allegedly
                    for consultations on the whole range of UN issues, but 90 percent of it
                    concerned the UNESCO decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So your office was quite involved with the decision to
                        withdraw from UNESCO? Because there was another part of IO that dealt with
                        UNESCO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: We were involved with the political blowback on it. I think the
                    decision really was made by Greg himself. There was an office, or still is an
                    office, for UNESCO affairs and IO, separate from IOUNP. But the decision itself
                    quickly became a political issue, it was handled in the course of our routine
                    consultations bilaterally and otherwise with a wide range of governments, so yes
                    we were heavily involved with defending that decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We might just note here that the first administration of
                        George W. Bush has taken the United States back into UNESCO and we're now
                        full members again.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: As we should be, and I think we also, thanks to the first
                    administration of George W. Bush, paid off all of our arrearages which were
                    another legacy from Ambassador Kirkpatrick's stage. She was very effective in
                    working with selected Republican senators to pass legislation in effect holding
                    back or threatening to hold back U.S. contributions to the UN, obligatory
                    contributions, against the day when the UN agency reformed in terms of budgetary
                    discipline or transparency, whatever. And those holdbacks amounted to quite a
                    huge arrearage by the time we started paying them off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are there any other major policy issues that you
                        particularly remember or that you were personally involved with that took up
                        a lot of energy and time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: There were whole clusters of issues as we call them, involving Israel
                    and southern Africa in those days, Namibia in particular. In each general
                    assembly you could count on five or six or eight resolutions bundled together
                    criticizing what was going on in Namibia, what South Africa had done, what
                    Israel was doing in the occupied territories and elsewhere, and in Jerusalem.
                    Those issues were hardy perennials on the agenda of the general assembly. We
                    were heavily involved each year in preparing for the pre-general assembly
                    consultations whereby we sent out bilateral teams to consult in capitals and in
                    the course of debate of those issues in the fall we had to send a lot of
                    instructions worldwide to capitals to get our points across. This involved
                    obviously a lot of paper going out. Often it went out very late at night and we
                    had to send some of it, unfortunately by immediate cable which meant somebody
                    had to be woken up in many capitals, and that inevitably led to some very frank
                    discussion with members of SS which controlled the outflow of cables. So that
                    too was a lesson. UNESCO, Arab-Israel, South Africa, those were the big ones
                    that we dealt with. I also had a certain role as headhunter, recruiter to fill
                    vacancies, both civil service and Foreign Service vacancies in the office. In
                    those days IOUNP had about 23 or 25 people. I believe it's a little smaller now.
                    A lot of secretaries, almost all of them civil service, or half of them civil
                    service, and a few permanent civil service members such as Ernie Grigg who had
                    served in New York with the USUN and had come down to Washington, had been in
                    the foreign service, but was really a UN expert par excellence and he was a
                    point of continuity for all of us foreign service types who sail through
                    UNP.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you had to work closely with all sorts of other parts
                        of the department.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes indeed. Particularly when the Secretary of State went up to New
                    York for the general debate that kicks off each fall's general assembly. We had
                    to do all kinds of briefing him around and cleared him with respect to
                    geographic bureaus. We had a wide range of issues on the agenda. The general
                    assembly involving the committees. Everything from arms control to disarmament
                    to human rights to budget management, to the standard political issues. So in
                    the course of clearing cables on the consultation worldwide and then on the
                    debate and in some cases on the vote, we dealt with most of the other bureaus of
                    the Department of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mention one trip with Assistant Secretary Newell to
                        the Middle East. Was there a lot of other travel involved during this? You
                        were there three years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I was there three years. My initial reaction to the work of UN-ery as
                    we called it was one of horror, to be appalled. I felt like my hands were dirty
                    sometimes because I just was so unused to the experience. I told Ed Dillery
                    that, and he said it would get better, and he was right. Because once I got used
                    to it and got into it, I began to like it. But it was an adjustment. For me a
                    big adjustment coming from the world of bilateral affairs to deal with this very
                    different world of multilateral affairs. I went over each fall, I forget which
                    month, I think it was September, to US to NATO to consult with my NATO
                    counterparts on UN issues. There was a tradition and perhaps it exists today, of
                    annual consultations on UN issues in the context of the NATO political
                    discussions. And experts came from capitals, in most cases from all the
                    countries including Washington, to cover the agenda. It was a one day exercise
                    which was useful for me. I enjoyed the experience. And I guess the Europeans
                    found it somewhat useful to hear from Washington what we were doing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Just before it started as I recall. It seems that would make it early
                    September, late August. I'm sure that's the time frame.</p>

                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It was an interesting lesson for me in the interplay of foreign policy,
                    or multilateral policy, and domestic policy. The Reagan administration, perhaps
                    following the example of its predecessors, parked a lot of its personnel baggage
                    in IO. There were several in addition to Greg Newell the assistant secretary.
                    There were others who were sandwiched in the bureaucracy of IO who could come
                    from the White House because they had to be placed somewhere and I gather the
                    White House didn't want them in the White House. So they put them in the policy
                    shop or the planning shop or whatever shop it was of IO. And these people were
                    not without influence. Very quirky sometimes, very definite Reaganauts, that is
                    right wing Republican. But you could talk to them. Their overseas experience was
                    not great, but they had a very definite point of view and they were listened to
                    by certain members of the administration including Greg Newell. This situation
                    was exacerbated when Alan Keyes succeeded Greg Newell. You recall he was a
                    prot�g�e of Jeane Kirkpatrick who yanked him out of FSO obscurity. I think he
                    was a mid-career officer in India when she found him, and promoted him to be one
                    of our ambassadors in New York. And then when Greg Newell left and I was still
                    in IOUNP, Alan Keyes came down to succeed him. Unlike Greg, who was very
                    politically attuned, Alan Keyes was much more ideological and intellectually
                    aggressive than Greg had been. I think he was far less effective
                    bureaucratically. He didn't mind making enemies or making waves. Greg had sort
                    of a single-minded focus on UNESCO and a very rigorous template of five
                    approaches by which every meeting was conducted. Alan was much more free form
                    and wide-ranging, intellectual sometimes. He was a Harvard graduate. Harvard
                    Ph.D. actually. But it wasn't as much fun. And as I say there was a decidedly
                    ideological cast to the bureau, to its decisions when he was there. For example,
                    one thing he tried to do and failed was to assert that as IO was the bureau
                    responsible for multilateral diplomacy, NATO should come under it because NATO
                    was a supremely multilateral organization. Needless to say, the colleagues in
                    EUR and RPM did not take kindly to that assertion. Still, it was fought all the
                    way to the Senate floor and there was unwillingness or an inability to
                    compromise and to clear things which meant that everything had to be carried out
                    to the Senate floor. IO would not agree, could not agree, the other bureaus
                    would not accept our position, and so I think it was just a much more difficult
                    bureaucratic environment with the approach that Alan took.</p>

                <p>WILLIAMS: No, Ed left about the time Alan came in a normal rotation. I forget

                    his ultimate destination, you're right. And Milt Covener came down the last year
                    I was there. I shouldn't say down, I forget where Milt had been. He'd been in
                    Moscow; he was an EUR hand, an economist and so forth.</p>

                <p>WILLIAMS: He may have been there; he had also been in Athens as economic
                    counselor and DCM. And Milt was there for my third and final year in IOUNP. He
                    too was getting a bath of reality in the multilateral world as I had gotten two
                    years before. He was bemused by it as I was, but unfortunately he had to deal
                    with the new atmosphere that Alan and his team created, whereas I think in all
                    honesty dealing with Greg Newell and his people was much easier. But the bureau
                    was really Alan when he was there. He was that large a personality, an ego. Sort
                    of consumed everything else. That said, I found him interesting. I've never seen
                    a more brilliant person, or a quirkier one. It's a strange combination.</p>

                        affairs. Was he quite involved in the issues of your office throughout this
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The Middle Eastern issues very often. I think we often dealt with the p
                    staff for certain issues. I don't recall specific cases when he got involved,
                    but generally speaking the Middle East was one set of issues he did get involved
                    in. The southern African issues were Chet Crocker's preserve and didn't go
                    really up to the Senate floor in my recollection. But generally the Middle
                    Eastern ones did. One other big issue which we did throughout my time there
                    which Jeane Kirkpatrick launched was the so-called voting practices report. It's
                    an annual report issued by IO, but really written by USUN which selects 10 key
                    votes and how every member of the UN voted on those votes compared to us and
                    then the whole range of other votes. Basically just see how other countries
                    lined up with us in coincidence of votes. Well, not surprisingly, very few
                    countries had a high coincidence of votes with us, because the issues of the
                    agenda of the general assembly were highly politicized against Israel, against
                    South Africa, against the developed world or to put it another way, for the
                    liberation movements, for the human rights groups, for the redistribution
                    efforts through UNCTAD and so forth. So by definition the agenda was somewhat
                    contentious and only a few countries, Israel was one, Britain another, would
                    line up with us on a regular basis more often than 50 percent of the time. But
                    putting out this report, which happened for the first time in 1984 I believe,
                    caused a real stir. Very few delegations professed to believe that we took their
                    votes in the general assembly and the UN family seriously, and when they saw in
                    black on white how poorly they were doing by our standards, they were somewhat
                    taken aback. But we refined the report of ethnologies as we got on it that came
                    better and we used that report and that coincidence figure in our bilateral
                    discussions with every member of the general assembly for the rest of my time in
                    IO and I think we still do it. For example, when the Secretary of State was
                    going to sit down with the foreign minister of, let's say, Senegal, one of the
                    issues that Secretary Shultz would be primed to discuss would be our coincidence
                    of voting, or lack of same. The approach would be, Mr. Minister we share a lot
                    of values in common, but can't we do better than this, whatever the figure was,
                    in terms of our voting. And it was designed to put the other side a bit on the
                    defensive and hopefully to elicit a change in voting practices. I don't think,
                    truth to tell, that there was a significant change in any country's voting
                    practices unless a coup occurred and the administration changed that way. But we
                    used that tool more and more in my last two years in IOUNP.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned Secretary of State George Shultz. He was
                        secretary throughout the period you were in IOUNP. Was he involved in your
                        issues a lot, were you involved with him much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The only regular involvement was the annual trek up to the general
                    assembly, and Shultz I think went up for about a week or 10 days. He spent a
                    good amount of time up there. The general debate usually lasted about three
                    weeks and he I think more than some secretaries of state, spent a good amount of
                    time on that. Not just he, but particularly he. So we had the secretary,
                    sometimes his deputy, sometimes P, but more often than not it was Secretary
                    Shultz.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Given your previous assignment and my interest, I guess I
                        should maybe finally ask, was Cyprus a big issue for you in IOUNP ever?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, only when the mandate for the UN forces in Cyprus, UNFICYP was
                    renewed every six months by the Security Council. Once or twice there was a
                    hiccup on this because of the funding or some policy issue or some complaint by
                    Turkey or by the government of Cyprus. But it was not a big issue. It was a
                    hardy perennial but not a big issue in terms of what we did in IOUNP. But it was
                    a matter of interest to me too, because of my previous association with it. One
                    other interesting thing I should note in terms of the interplay of foreign and
                    domestic policy is that the Reagan administration including the president
                    himself ideologically liked to beat up on the United Nations. It was a
                    convenient whipping boy; you could kick them in the shin and they wouldn't kick
                    back. And this played well to a certain part of their constituency. On the other
                    hand, Ronald Reagan was also a very pragmatic person and a very pragmatic
                    showman and he knew that there were few platforms better than that of the
                    general assembly in the fall in New York. And so I don't believe President
                    Reagan missed a single chance to go up there in the general debate, address the
                    multitudes, have a magnificent photo op for Mike Deaver and his people to
                    capture for the world media, and then to have what we call brief encounters on
                    the parquet. Mix and mingle or grip and grin with selected leaders who would
                    have maybe five minutes of standup discussion with him. These were all carefully
                    orchestrated events, designed less for substance I think than for show, but also
                    did project the image of an engaged president mixing with other leaders of the
                    world, and I think it served his base well. So there's this curious dichotomy in
                    the mindset of that administration, as perhaps with every administration. But
                    particularly the Reaganites were hardcore. Some of them very much against the
                    UN. Alan Keyes for example. And yet their president never missed a chance to go
                    up there. I think he made the right decision.</p>

                <p>WILLIAMS: We worked through SS on these presidential events, not with the
                    National Security Council staff. I don't recall ever talking to anybody in the
                    National Security Council. It went through SS, often on a very intense back and
                    forth, but the choreography of those events was fairly routine and not difficult
                    to do. We dealt only though in our own chain of command, not with the White
                    House.</p>

                        and so on? Could your office pretty much work indirectly with USUN, pretty
                        much send instructions, or did you need to clear those with the NSC, or any
                        other agencies?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Rarely with the NSC. If it was the standard political consultations on
                    the issues in the UN family, the clearances in the Department of State sufficed.
                    If it was something like the World Conference on Women which occurred every five
                    years and one year Maureen Reagan, the president's daughter, was the head of our
                    delegation, then obviously we cleared it with the NSC. One of the night notes I
                    got to write after that conference ended was to tell the president in first
                    person terms that his daughter had been able to achieve something that had
                    eluded the U.S. government for 15 or 20 years. We actually got a resolution on
                    one of the thornier issues on the agenda. It may have been family planning. But
                    Maureen Reagan had the good fortune to preside over a victory in that form for
                    the U.S. and it was something of which we were very proud because our office had
                    been involved, as had other offices in the department and in the NSC, in putting
                    that position together.</p>

                        Placing Americans. Or was that done by somebody else in the International
                        Organizations bureau?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: There is another office in IO that handles placement of Americans. We
                    were very concerned about the number of Soviet nationals in positions of
                    influence in the UN system. We made a strong effort, I think we still do, to
                    place good Americans in similar or better positions, but IOUNP was not really
                    involved in doing that per se, but we certainly were aware of it. When Vernon
                    Walters came in as permanent representative succeeding Jeane Kirkpatrick, it
                    seemed to me we put more of an emphasis on that. I'm not sure if Ambassador
                    Walters was the reason, but I do remember getting more heavily involved in IOUNP
                    at that time. It was a matter of longstanding concern. Another issue related to
                    it was the number of Soviet and Chinese and hostile country nationals at the UN,
                    and the geographic limitations under which they were allowed to operate by the
                    FBI (Federal Bureau of Investigation). The Libyans for example could only go 25
                    miles from ground zero at UN plaza. It was a very complicated procedure for
                    getting permission to go outside that authorized circle. Our office had a civil
                    servant named Frank Provin who had excellent ties with the bureau, with
                    diplomatic security, with others, and he was the one who generally coordinated
                    through UNP the U.S. position on those issues. There were issues involving
                    travel, there were issues involving failure to pay rent, harassment claims and
                    so forth, so there was the sort of unseemly aspect of diplomacy, but a very real
                    one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in any changes of policy in that
                        area, or not really in your time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0108" n="Page0108"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No. It was a growing concern of which I became increasingly aware by
                    the security bureaucracy of first of all the number of these Chinese in
                    particular, Soviet nationals in the country, and where they all were and what
                    they were all doing. But I don't recall a major policy issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that General Vernon Dick Walters succeeded
                        Jeane Kirkpatrick. That was at a time you were still in the office. Any
                        other differences affecting IOUNP from that change, in New York?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Well, the relationship with USUN up in New York I think became more
                    collegial or less testy. There was always a tension between us and USUN when
                    Ambassador Kirkpatrick was there because they ran roughshod over us thanks to
                    her political power, and they didn't mind doing it. I won't say they had a
                    choice, but I will say it was more pleasant dealing with the Walters team after
                    Walters came aboard, so that was the main atmospheric change, more than a policy
                    change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, anything else about IOUNP or should we proceed to your
                        next assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, I think that covers it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go from that office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I started looking around in the fall of '85 for overseas jobs,
                    primarily DCMships because the prevailing wisdom was to get over the threshold
                    into the senior service you really had to have a DCMship or something with broad
                    management experience overseas in addition to whatever credits you've piled up
                    at home. Then one day I looked at my inbox and there was a cable listing the
                    available jobs. In the middle was a job in Berlin which had never been there
                    before and by great good luck I got my name into the hopper for that job, talked
                    to John Kornblum on the phone, he was the minister in Berlin at the time. I got
                    the job and we went off to Berlin in the summer of 1986.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what was the job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The job was political advisor which is a misnomer. It did indeed give
                    political advice, but essentially it was the number 2 position in the State
                    Department component of what was basically an occupation regime for Berlin, or
                    for the western sectors of Berlin depending on how you look at it. We had a
                    large mission in Berlin with a very large budget, funded by the bundestag, the
                    so-called occupation cost budget, and the mission was subordinate to its chief
                    of mission who was in Bonn. I did not know much about Berlinery as we called it
                    when I went to Berlin. I had spent a lot of time in German affairs, and when I
                    was in Bonn, I guess because I was so taken with the small town in Germany
                    approach of Bonn, I deliberately stayed away from the big city of Berlin. I only
                    went up once for an SPD convention which I enjoyed. I had been in Berlin before
                    as a tourist, but I found the city too big and just not to my liking. Certainly
                    not with a family. Well it turned out I was wrong on that as I was on many
                    things. Berlin was a great place for a family, especially when you had the
                    resources available that the American sector did. As I said, these were all,
                    except for salaries, almost all paid for by the bundestag through a budget that
                    was passed each year for the Allied occupation, or the Allied at cost
                    expenditures in Berlin. The French, the British, and we were subsidized that
                    way. Both the civilians and the military components, to a very high degree. We
                    were also part of, as I said, an occupation regime, formally speaking. The army
                    ran the American sector of Berlin. We were in the chain of command there to some
                    extent. And to some extent they were in ours. For example, the senior army
                    person in Berlin had four hats, one of which was DCM of U.S. embassy Bonn in
                    Berlin. Now it was a hat that had not been worn ever as far as I knew, certainly
                    not in recent memory. But he was the senior military official in Berlin. He was
                    the commandant of the American sector in Berlin, senior army official in Berlin,
                    and the deputy chief of mission in Berlin. That took some getting used to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't you come then to where the United States mission
                        in Berlin fit in, both in terms of the military and vis-�-vis the embassy in
                        Bonn.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Our job essentially was to advise the commandant and his staff on a
                    whole range of issues, political, economic, and public safety which meant
                    security. We had counterparts in the military. There was also a large air force
                    component there, mainly at Tempelhof Air Force Base which had played such a key
                    role in our victory during the Berlin blockade in '48, '49. But we liaised with
                    the army and the air force, mainly with the army, and with Berliners on
                    intelligence collection, security, economic development, handling refugees,
                    debriefing refugees from the east, running operations against the Soviets in the
                    western sectors of Berlin. The Soviets had a large presence in Berlin. Both the
                    embassy in East Berlin and certain Soviet missions that were authorized by the
                    Quadripartite Agreement in West Berlin. We and the British and French were very
                    diligent in working to confront whatever mischief the Soviets would carry out
                    from the other side. Those missions, those establishments. We had a liaison also
                    with our chief of mission in Bonn and there was as we discussed last time a Bonn
                    group staffed down in the embassy which dealt with Berlin. So-called Bonn group.
                    It was our counterparts from the British and French embassies, plus the German
                    government through the foreign ministry that comprised the Bonn group in Bonn.
                    And we were frequently in touch with them. I would say, obviously because we
                    were physically located within the U.S. commandant's headquarters, obviously our
                    daily exchange was far more intimate with the U.S. military in Berlin and with
                    the Berlin authorities than with Bonn. But we had to keep both informed. And
                    this sometimes required a bit of delicate dancing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you also had to do a fair amount of liaison with the
                        other two western powers in Berlin and perhaps with the Soviets as well, in
                        Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Exactly so. We had a lot of interaction with the British and French.
                    There was a whole network of message traffic classified up to the secret level
                    which we used. We exchanged notes, opinions, gossip; we met for lunch once a
                    month. We saw each other on our national days. There was intimate exchange with
                    the British and French. To my great surprise the exchange that each of us in our
                    own capacities had with our Soviet colleague who was an official of the Soviet
                    embassy in East Berlin was almost as intense. We shared a responsibility; the
                    four powers did, for the safe management of Berlin as a whole, in particular for
                    the management of the access routes and the air routes to and from Berlin.
                    Nobody wanted to have any trouble in Berlin, that had been very clear since the
                    Quadripartite Agreement had been signed back in the early '70s. A big part of my
                    job, my British and French counterparts' job and my Soviet colleague's job, was
                    to make sure there was no trouble in Berlin, so that when, inevitably, there was
                    an incident at the border, somebody got shot or something encroached, a concrete
                    truck smashed against a building, or there was a complaint about a waterway or a
                    dam, or a plane crashed or whatever, we would consult about it and if necessary
                    the Allied chair for the month, we rotated chairmanship among the three western
                    missions, would talk to the Soviet counterpart about it and see if we could
                    smooth things out, and that worked pretty well.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And to what extent were there four power quadripartite
                        meetings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: There were no quadripartite meetings of any consequence until after the
                    wall fell and German unity started approaching very rapidly. The days I'm
                    speaking of, '86, '87, '88, even most of '89, there were no quadripartite
                    meetings, but the four of us, so to speak, would get together at the annual ball
                    of the Berlin air safety center which was a quadripartite-manned air traffic
                    control center for the Berlin air corridors and the column of air around Berlin.
                    They gave a lovely ball every year and we would inevitably with our wives in our
                    formal wear, talk shop, the four of us, about what was going on. But it was not
                    a meeting per se, there were no notes kept for example.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you refer to the four of you, you're really talking
                        about the other political advisors, or the number twos in the respective
                        missions of the four powers, and the number ones would also interact with
                        each other at these events and others.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: They would interact too in more or less a similar way. There was an
                    amazing harmony of interaction at all levels. The three ministers would interact
                    and meet occasionally with the DCM of the Soviet embassy in East Berlin who was
                    Igor McSimichev for the whole time I was there I think. Brilliant man. We always
                    spoke in German and he was always very well-informed. Below that, the political
                    advisors would meet, monthly at lunch, more often as needed. We would exchange
                    inter-Allied messages on a whole range of issues every day. Our economic
                    advisors would meet the three of them public safety advisors and so on and so
                    on. There was a whole range of Allied coordination mechanisms, often involving
                    military counterparts as well, and often involving liaison with the Berliners,
                    so by the time we got there this had been fleshed out over almost four decades
                    and was well along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your title was political advisor, but you also were the
                        number two in the mission, at least on the State Department side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Number three. Actually, number four. It depends on how you count.
                    Unfortunately, for whatever reason, the hierarchy was that the chief of mission
                    was the ambassador in Bonn. The deputy chief of mission was the military
                    commandant, at least on paper. And that led to a problem which we can discuss.
                    The number three was the minister in Berlin who was the actual guy in charge of
                    the mission day by day, and the number four was the political advisor. That was
                    I. In practical terms I was the number two. In theological and protocol terms I
                    was number four.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, on a day-to-day basis you were the executive officer.
                        You were the deputy for all practical purposes. Did that mean that a fair
                        amount of your time was basically helping the minister manage the mission,
                        or could you do political work much of the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I started by doing political work much of the time because John
                    Kornblum was so brilliant and so engaged and so knowledgeable about German
                    affairs that basically he could run USPER, as we called the mission, out of his
                    back pocket. So I had a learning curve to go through and I did. And spent a lot
                    of time initially learning about the political realities of working in Berlin.
                    Later in my tour, and this continued through the rest of my foreign service
                    career, I dealt increasingly with the management issues, including budget and
                    personnel, and for the first time realized how much fun I'd been missing all
                    those years when I thought the political work was the end of all things in the
                    foreign service. But initially it was political. John, perhaps deliberately,
                    perhaps not, sort of threw me into the cold bath without a whole lot of
                    preparation. He was gone at one time. At several key points he was gone from
                    Berlin, from Germany, and I was the acting minister. And the first time this
                    happened was in November of '86, We had an issue before the Allied Kommandatura.
                    This was the governing body of Berlin created at the end of World War II from
                    which the Soviets had withdrawn in '48. The AK met on a monthly basis; this was
                    ministers. And the issue before the Kommandatura was how to implement a German
                    court decision that had found the Libyans responsible for a particularly
                    grievous act of bombing. I think it was Labelle disco or something else. I
                    forget the specifics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which happened in 1984 or thereabouts.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It happened early in '86 in Berlin. The Allied Kommandatura had to deal
                    with the issue of what to do about a German court decision that had put in
                    public record the fact that Libya was responsible for the bombing of the disco
                    in West Berlin in which a couple of people had been killed. This was at the
                    Labelle disco which had been frequented by American military. This bombing
                    occurred a few months before I got to Berlin in '86 and by November of '86 the
                    issue had come up to the Kommandatura. Our legal advisors, every mission also
                    had a legal advisor or two, and others concluded that the only way you could
                    react to that in a meaningful sense since our writ did not extend to East
                    Berlin, would be to issue a formal order expelling the Libyans from Berlin.
                    Realizing that the practical effect of that order would be to affect only their
                    presence in the western sectors of Berlin. They would still be able to circulate
                    freely in eastern Berlin since the Soviets were not about to expel them from
                    their sector. This raised a whole lot of issues including West Germany's desire
                    to maintain good relations with Libya. Genscher the German foreign minister at
                    the time was particularly involved in that effort. And that meant that at the
                    end the ambassador in Bonn, Rick Burt, was also much interested. And without
                    having ever been briefed by anybody on how the Kommandatura worked, without
                    having ever attended a session of the Kommandatura, I found myself as acting
                    minister not only going, but presiding over the meeting since it was the
                    American month. We met over a series of five or seven days. It was a difficult
                    exercise for me because I did not know the protocol of the Kommandatura
                    meetings. There was definitely a protocol. You addressed each other a certain
                    way, you had to follow something like Robert's rules of order. I was corrected a
                    number of times by my colleagues who were real ministers, the British and the
                    French, the British in particular. But since we all wanted the same thing and
                    there really was no dissent on that, the question was how do you get there in
                    the most correct way. And we got there, and we issued the order and expelled the
                    Libyans from Berlin, realizing that we were in effect expelling them only from
                    the western sectors. Now the coordination that I also had to learn on the fly
                    was to keep the military commandant informed because there were implications for
                    the security of West Berlin because he had to make sure his people, Berliners,
                    would carry out this order. If a Libyan tried to come into West Berlin he would
                    not be allowed and so forth. And Rick Burt was on the phone with me about every
                    two hours or hour, asking what in the hell was going on because the Germans were
                    asking him. What are you Allies about to do in Berlin to our Libyan
                    relationship. So it was a delicate dance. We got through it. I was able to keep,
                    I think, the commandant and the ambassador satisfied although two times I had to
                    keep Rick Burt waiting while I finished telling the commandant what was going on
                    and I don't think Rick Burt liked being kept waiting, but you have to make
                    choices in this life. It was quite an education, and after it was all over I
                    realized how much I'd learned, and I felt the Kommandatura had done a very good
                    job and I was grateful that John had given me that chance. I just wish I'd had a
                    little more preparation for it. Ironically enough, this was in November of 1986
                    when all this happened. I must say it didn't make much of a blip in the papers.
                    The real blips were behind the scenes with the Germans in particular. The same
                    issue rose again in the summer of '87. Once again there was no minister. I was
                    acting, and once again we were in the chair so I was chair in the Kommandatura.
                    And the issue came up with Iranians. The Iranians had done something
                    particularly egregious involving terrorism. A German court had conclusively
                    issued a report, the German authorities had, that the Iranians were guilty of
                    terrorism in Germany, or in Berlin I forget which. So once again, having done it
                    to the Libyans, we decided as the Allied Kommandatura we would do it to the
                    Iranians. And we did. With exactly the same type of to-ing and fro-ing. There
                    was a little more concern that the Iranians might do something crazy because we
                    didn't know much about them compared to the Libyans. Nothing did happen, but
                    there was some concern based on intelligence reports that there would be untold
                    reaction. But we expelled the Iranians who were based in West Berlin from
                    Berlin. That is, from the western sectors of Berlin, acting as the Allied
                    Kommandatura. Once again, I was the one who kept the commandant informed and
                    kept the ambassador in Bonn informed. I felt pretty good expelling people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In addition to the challenge of coordinating with the
                        ambassador in Bonn and the commandant in Berlin, did you have to coordinate
                        pretty carefully with the State Department in Washington or were you pretty
                        much on your own in working these things out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The State Department by this point had given USBER a pretty long leash
                    on this sort of thing. I did not talk to the State Department colleagues, but
                    Don Koglitz our legal advisor I'm sure was in touch with his colleagues back in
                    L. Deputy Political Advisor Brass Smith and others were talking to people back
                    in EURCE so Washington was certainly witting to what was going on. We also sent
                    cables back telling them what we were doing and what we planned to do, but there
                    was really not a whole lot of input on that, as I recall, from Washington. I
                    don't recall any input. No complaint about what we did, but also nothing
                    particular.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, as political advisor, to what extents were you
                        engaged, involved, reporting on West Berlin politicians, political
                        developments, parties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Well quite a bit because we dealt of course with a lot of Berliners. At
                    my level we dealt with the governing mayor. So we dealt with the governing mayor
                    and his immediate staff in the senate as it was called which was the government
                    of Berlin. Dealt with other politicians. When I came there the governing mayor
                    was CDU, Christian Democrat, but we dealt with the Social Democrats as well
                    because we realized that at some point they would succeed the CDU as indeed they
                    did. We did that at a fairly intensive level so that we would report our
                    conversations, our discussions. Sometimes we would have business to do, I would
                    just transact business with the governing mayor, and usually the minister would
                    do that, more often I would deal with his deputies in the senate. The Greens
                    came on our screen at this time also. In Berlin they were called the Alternative
                    List, the AL, but they were an offshoot of the National Green Party in West
                    Germany with which I had some experience from my time in Bonn. They were
                    initially very allergic to people who wore suits and ties and suspicious of the
                    Allies who had been occupying their city for so many decades and what we stood
                    for and this and that. But their concerns were I think more economic and
                    ecological than anti-imperialist so we could have a discussion with them. They
                    would accept our invitations to come to our house. I had one of the so-called
                    representational houses and a staff and a budget to use it. And so we would
                    often have large functions there with a lot of folks from the mission, some of
                    the military and some of the Allied and the Berliners including the Greens, the
                    Alternative List. I won't say they ever became close friends, but they did come
                    and we got to know each other professionally which was useful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of functions did you have? I know, never having
                        served in Berlin, there were some kind of unique types of representation
                        functions that seemed to work very well.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: We had large receptions on a number of occasions. Obviously whenever a
                    visitor came through or a CODEL (Congressional delegation) or an FBI team or
                    whatever it was, we would use my residence or the minister's residence,
                    sometimes the commandant's for large functions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Smoking evenings? Herenaben?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes, that's a German tradition which we had in Berlin too. Basically
                    that's an evening for men. Since Beth Jones and others were members of our staff
                    didn't take kindly to the designation of herenaben which would seem to exclude
                    them. But we got around that. In fact, an increasing number of women staffed
                    USBER in my time there, so I think the term fell into disuse. But essentially
                    when I got there it was still in vogue with an evening where men of influence
                    from the Allied missions from the Berlin government, from the military, from the
                    economic sector of the Chamber of Commerce would get together and discuss things
                    of great moment over very good food with cigars at the end. A noble
                    tradition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that Beth Jones was on the staff, what was
                        her position at the time? She's now assistant secretary for European
                        affairs.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Indeed she is. Beth was the economic advisor with counterparts in the
                    Allied missions and I think certainly in the Berlin city government she dealt
                    with the Chamber of Commerce quite a bit, the fairgrounds people since the
                    fairgrounds is a big part of the Berlin economy. She was very much involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now there was of course an American embassy in East Berlin
                        at this time, accredited to the German democratic republic. To what extent
                        were you involved with that embassy and how did you share responsibilities?
                        Because you did have some responsibilities for Berlin as a whole including
                        the eastern sector.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Formally we were responsible for Berlin as a whole as were the other
                    Allied missions in West Berlin with the Soviet embassy in East Berlin. The
                    minister, whether it was John Kornblum or Harry Gilmore, his successor, I think
                    as a matter of routine met with the ambassador in East Berlin whether it was
                    Dick Bartley or Frank Meehan, at least once a month, maybe more often. There
                    were a number of issues to talk about, but most of the issues that we dealt with
                    at USBER did not involve the embassy in East Berlin because the embassy did not
                    deal with Berlin per se except to the extent the East German government was
                    there which it was to some extent very limited with the East Berlin government.
                    But our folks in the East Berlin embassy were accredited to the German
                    Democratic Republic and took their responsibility primarily in the field of the
                    bilateral relationship leaving to us Berlinery with all of the niggling issues
                    involving waterways and canals and borders and sewage systems and security that
                    entailed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Air access?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Air access too. We ran the air access. We had a program to exercise the
                    right of military access in East Berlin or the Soviet sector of Berlin as we
                    called it, on a daily basis. And on a daily basis we would send military convoys
                    through Checkpoint Charlie who would travel around in East Berlin and come back.
                    They were always followed, they were always checked through with the correct
                    procedure and checked out in the correct way, but that was deliberately designed
                    to show that we were not going to give up our right of access to Berlin as a
                    whole. In this case, the Soviet sector. And occasionally these vehicles would be
                    involved in a fender bender or a pedestrian would get hit, or they would render
                    aid to somebody who had gotten hurt or fallen unconscious. There were a few
                    cases where essentially a humanitarian incident arose or they would have to go
                    to the hospital because one of them got sick very quickly, it was an emergency,
                    and we had to get them back. And this was handled strictly by the missions in
                    West Berlin. Occasionally the consular officer at the embassy in East Berlin
                    might get involved, but more often than not they would come straight through the
                    Soviet channel to the respective Allied force in West Berlin. It was convoluted
                    to be sure, but it worked pretty well, because as I said at this point in the
                    late 1980s we'd been doing it for over forty years. Nobody wanted trouble in
                    Berlin and when there were problems or incidents or whatever all four sides
                    worked to make sure that we settled it as quickly as possible. Another example,
                    this also extended it to East Germany where we had a different set of access
                    rules, each of the three western Allies had a military liaison mission in
                    Potsdam. The Soviets had one based in Frankfurt, reciprocal. And the purpose was
                    to stage military liaison missions which were actually overt spy missions on
                    what the respective forces were doing in East Germany in the case of the Soviets
                    and in West Germany in the case of the Allies. And so our Soviet hands at the
                    Potsdam military liaison mission had a frequent period of travel through East
                    Germany to the Soviet encampments, not East German places, mainly to see what
                    they were doing, because the Soviets at that time had a huge presence still in
                    East Germany. A year before I came to Berlin, there had been an incident where
                    Major Nicholson, who was one of the members of the military liaison mission, had
                    been shot and killed while doing his duty at a Soviet cantonment somewhere in
                    East Germany. He'd been shot by a sentry who'd been told to shoot anybody who
                    got near the tent. The major was near the tent, he was shot. He was still alive.
                    But as the Soviet soldier had no further instructions he kept everybody else at
                    bay with his rifle and the major bled to death. This led to a huge incident
                    between us and the Soviets, between the Allies and the Soviets, because the
                    British and French were just as concerned that it could have been one of theirs.
                    We were not in the reporting chain on these things, but we did hear about them
                    when they came back through Berlin because we were in close touch with our MLM
                    friends. They kept the USCAB the army intelligence folks in Berlin informed, but
                    they had a separate reporting channel, their own stovepipe. And I forget exactly
                    where it happened, but in the wake of the Nicholson story and the bad blood over
                    that, steps were taken to reduce the likelihood of that again. Allegedly the
                    Soviets instructed their sentries to be more careful and we took some steps to
                    have some extra communications capability in case something like that happened
                    again. I forget how it happened, but at one point in the fall of whatever year
                    it was, just about the time Secretary Shultz was going to sit down with his
                    Soviet counterpart, Gromyko. A member of our mission in Potsdam was driving one
                    of these Mercedes gallendewagen, it's like a hummer, off-road vehicle, on duty,
                    they flag was flying. It was clearly a U.S. military vehicle, and for whatever
                    reason he was shot through the arm. He wasn't killed and he wasn't seriously
                    wounded, but the bullet went through the flesh of his upper arm. And that was
                    reported back through channels. What happened was we short circuited the
                    process. We heard about it through normal liaison with our military colleagues
                    in Berlin and realizing the significance of it, and knowing the secretary was
                    getting ready to sit down with Gromyko, we sent a cable back. We cleared it
                    within the military in Berlin, sent a cable back saying, look, the Secretary is
                    going to meet with Gromyko. He should land very heavily on the Soviet because
                    this just happened. We weren't trying to poach on anybody's territory, but we
                    were on a time constraint because the meeting was a few hours away and we knew
                    if we communicated the other way it would just take too long. Well there was a
                    huge blowup over that within our sector because we had short-circuited the
                    process. The reporting chain for the MLM went to Berlin, to Heidelberg, to NATO
                    I think or to SHAPE and then back to the Pentagon and then to State. That's the
                    way they liked to report things, and that's the way the military chain of
                    command goes. And in effect we did this and Secretary Shultz raised it with his
                    counterpart before the Secretary of Defense ever found out about it. So he was
                    not pleased, the Secretary of Defense, and naturally his unhappiness was visited
                    down the chain of command. So that was a lesson for all of us and me
                    particularly as a civilian in how the military chain of command works. I won't
                    say I learned the lesson perfectly, I certainly didn't, but it made us a little
                    more sensitive to it. On the other hand, I think given the circumstances we did
                    exactly the right thing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned previously that there was a problem with the
                        chain of command, the commandant. Was it this incident you were referring
                        to, or was there another one?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, it's part of a piece. For years, I won't say forever, but for a
                    long time the practice had been that the commandant in Berlin was always an army
                    two star, was the supreme American official resident in Berlin who took
                    political advice from the mission. The U.S. minister was the supreme political
                    advisor in Berlin who reported directly to Washington and to Bonn and did not
                    take directions from the commandant on matters within his domain as the
                    commandant did not take direction from us on matters in his domain. To be fair,
                    I think many members of USBER and I'll include myself in that, probably had a
                    somewhat too civilian an attitude about some things and not a respectful enough
                    position towards some of the military sensitivities. And this incident about the
                    chain of command and MLM may indicate that. There was some resentment there.
                    Some of it may have been personal based on how earlier ministers had reacted or
                    not reacted to things that the military considered important. For the military,
                    for example, ceremonial things are very important and you go to ceremonies and
                    if you don't go to ceremonies that tells them something about how you feel about
                    them, their culture, their way of life. I'm generalizing crudely without trying
                    to give too many specifics here. So when John Kornblum left after a very
                    successful tour as minister he was in our generation Mr. Germany. Kind of the
                    Martin Hillenbrand of American foreign service officers. Nobody came close to
                    John in terms of expertise and depth of experience. Real wisdom in how the
                    Germans function, how they think. When he left, Harry Gilmore followed. Also a
                    very competent German European hand with a lot of eastern experience that John
                    had not had. But more significantly what happened was that the commandant
                    changed a little later. John Mitchell had been commandant when we got there,
                    hale fellow, well-met, very good at ceremony, at presiding over meetings, very
                    deferential to our collective political expertise as we were deferential to his
                    military expertise. His successor, the last commandant in Berlin, was Ray
                    Haddock, also a two star army general, who came to Berlin with a very different
                    agenda in mind. He had been one of the commanders of the deployment sites for
                    the P2s, the Persians, in southwestern Germany. Married to a German, spoke
                    pretty good German, and had done some very delicate and successful negotiations
                    with the local officials in Dadenvertenberg, southwest Germany, when the fight
                    over the deployment of these Persians was being waged. And they were deployed
                    and from all that I heard and read and was told he did an excellent job in
                    helping prepare public opinion for that event. And he may have been encouraged
                    to some extent by the other members of the staff of the USCAB who had gone
                    through the Mitchell era and wanted to right the balance a bit. I'll put it that
                    way. So he basically saw an opportunity in this fourth hat that the senior
                    military person wore in Berlin, and tried to exercise authority as the DCM in
                    Berlin over U.S. mission in Berlin, USBER. Now we of course did clear cables
                    with each other. We were very correct about that. Whenever we had a major
                    assessment that went out on the political scene in Berlin or the coming
                    elections in Berlin or a visit by the governing mayor to Washington which always
                    involved some face time in the White House with the President, we would clear
                    that with either the commandant or his staff, as a courtesy. We didn't think we
                    should skip them. Ray Haddock cleared it himself. As I recall his initials in
                    bold print were on there. And I forget what precipitated, but basically he made
                    a pitch to Ambassador Walters, a retired three star general, among other things,
                    that he as the commandant in Berlin and the deputy chief of mission in Berlin
                    should be in the chain of command substantively over USBER when it came to
                    cables, recommendations, decisions and so forth. He really wanted to eat our
                    lunch. And he made a very strong case for it. Harry Gilmore, to his credit, made
                    a very strong rebuttal, but he was always rebutting the very aggressive outreach
                    by the commandant and it went to Ambassador Walters in Bonn. At one point, Harry
                    Gilmore, the minister, and the commandant Ray Haddock went down to Bonn and met
                    with Walters separately, and essentially, Walters, who hated this issue and did
                    not want to decide it, affirmed the traditional way of doing things. He told
                    Harry to go back and not gloat over it and told Ray to go back and do his job,
                    as I understand it. I was not in those meetings, so I'm giving this to you third
                    hand, so that's basically what happened. But throughout my time there and I
                    think it continued throughout Ray's tour, he stayed there a year longer than I
                    did, there was this tension. It was not as collegial. It had not always been
                    collegial. I did look into the history of this when I was in Berlin and there
                    had been times before when very brilliant and aggressive and ambitious military
                    folks had asserted authority over USBER on certain issues. Sometimes
                    successfully, sometimes not. This is inevitable in a bureaucracy. It's nothing
                    unusual. But it was unfortunate in the last phase of the occupation in Berlin
                    that our sector had this problem. In earlier years the British had had a
                    commandant who was a bit off the range, and I think the French at one time did
                    too. But we had extra coordination problems in this last phase. That said, it
                    never really got out of hand. We always worked very carefully with each other on
                    very sensitive intelligence matters, on the whole issue of how to deal with the
                    realities created by the fall of the wall on November 9, 1989. The refugee
                    problems. Cooperation really never broke down anywhere as far as I could tell,
                    and I would have known about it. But it was just not as much fun as it should
                    have been. I think it was basically because he wanted to be in charge of us and
                    we didn't want him to be in charge of us.</p>

                <p>WILLIAMS: I don't think anybody on the scene in Berlin and perhaps even in Bonn
                    who was following this issue as it developed in the summer and fall of '89
                    anticipated what happened. In retrospect, it looked so clear, and you wonder how
                    we missed it. But if anybody anticipated such a thing he didn't report it, or at
                    least I never saw the report. We were all too close to it I think. There had
                    been concern for several months that the East German regime was getting wobbly.
                    A lot of its young people were leaving or trying to leave and this accelerated
                    in the late summer and early fall of '89 when Hungary opened its border with
                    Austria. There was as I recall regime change in Hungary. They decided to open
                    their border with Austria and take the barbed wire down and this was broadcast
                    as straight news in the West German and East German medium. East Berliners got
                    both. And they quickly realized that as Hungary was still a communist country,
                    formally speaking, they could go there as tourists and then very easily cross
                    over into the West through Austria. And so a number of them started doing that.
                    Numbers of East Germans were leaving East Germany through Hungary to Austria to
                    West Germany in effect. We were monitoring this through various channels; this
                    was not an overt stream. Refugee groups were processing these folks at various
                    points. But the desire to get out was particularly acute among the young people,
                    married people, single people, students, who just saw no hope in their society
                    and saw tremendous opportunity and wealth in West Germany. Numbers started going
                    out through Czechoslovakia as well. There was a time when the West German
                    embassy in Prague was inhabited by several thousand East German refugees who had
                    gotten into Czechoslovakia, another communist country, legally as tourists from
                    East Germany but had not been given visas by West Germany, yet nevertheless they
                    climbed over the fence and camped there. In September or October this led to
                    another highly publicized situation in which the living conditions on the
                    grounds of the German embassy in Prague became so acute that people were afraid
                    folks were going to start dying of plague or dysentery or various things because
                    it was just an impossible situation and more and more folks were coming. It was
                    acting as a magnet for more and more East Germans. So finally the West Germans
                    negotiated a so-called one time agreement with the Czechs and the East Germans
                    to let these East Germans go on trains, sealed trains that would pass through
                    East Germany into West Germany from Prague. That was how they came as I recall.
                    The Czechs wanted them out of there; the East Germans wanted the issue to go
                    away. They wanted the East Germans back, but for whatever reason they agreed. So
                    the East Germans left. That was the second thing. And then the third thing that
                    happened, in October, was the East German national day, and for this one
                    Gorbachev came. It was a state visit as well as the national day with all the
                    pomp and circumstance of which German military bands are so capable. We watched
                    it all on T.V. of course and we had a lot of people in East Berlin at the site
                    where the parades occurred, the torchlight parades as well as the military
                    parades. But essentially, Gorbachev said in public to the East German regime,
                    those that cannot change to meet the demands of the present are doomed. In other
                    words, we're not going to help you. His message was somewhat veiled, but it was
                    interpreted both East and West to mean if you get in a real situation here the
                    Soviet troops are not going to bail you out. There was also a lot of pacifist
                    church led groups in Leipzig in particular in East Germany and other cities, in
                    Dresden, which grew and grew from candlelight vigils to mass demonstrations
                    where at one point there were 100,000 or more East Germans chanting in the
                    streets of Leipzig, “We are the people, we want some change”. It was peaceful.
                    These were not mutinous citizens, they were far more peaceful than West Berlin
                    demonstrators were when they would demonstrate for something. These were
                    anarchists we had to deal with in West Berlin, but in East Germany, not in East
                    Berlin but in the big cities of East Germany largely pacifist, well-behaved, but
                    huge groups of people. We had reported all this, we had internalized it, but we
                    had not connected the dots to that meant the regime was tottering.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>So was the East German politburo had a meeting I guess sometime on the ninth of
                    November. On the evening news the government spokesman for East Germany read a
                    decision by the politburo. It basically said as of tomorrow morning any East
                    German citizen who wants to leave East Germany may do so with proper
                    documentation. It looked as if he couldn't quite believe what he was reading as
                    he read it. Nevertheless he read it, and this was one of several news items.
                    This was not the big story, there was no follow-up, but that was just one of the
                    announcements. I was with Ann in a movie theater that night. Around nine or nine
                    thirty they stopped the film, turned on all the lights and asked Mr. Williams to
                    come to the desk if he would. This was an American military theater on one of
                    the bases we had in Berlin. This had never happened to me before. It was Harry
                    Gilmore on the phone saying he had just gotten a very puzzling message to the
                    effect that crowds of East Germans were spilling into West Berlin at one of the
                    checkpoints. He said he wasn't quite sure what this meant, but maybe I should
                    come down to the office and see. For the next four days I lived at the office
                    and we kept watch and informed Washington of what was happening. Essentially
                    what happened was when the East Berlin population heard that news report they
                    went down, even though they didn't have documentation, that meant an exit visa,
                    that's what the East Germans required, you're supposed to get an exit visa
                    stamped into your passport and with that you would be allowed to leave to go to
                    the West. They didn't have that documentation because the offices weren't open,
                    but they nevertheless went down to the checkpoints where you would normally
                    cross. More and more of them gathered and there were thousands and then tens of
                    thousands and the pressure got quite high because people were getting afraid
                    folks would get crushed. The guards at the checkpoints, the East Germans, had
                    absolutely no instructions on this point. Fortunately they decided to take the
                    easy way out and not to use deadly force to keep the crowds back. When it got
                    too bad they simply lifted the turnstile and the folks were allowed to come
                    through. And that's basically what happened. The wall was breached at several
                    points when the guards lifted the barrier and the crowds swarmed through. The
                    people couldn't believe they had gotten through without being shot and what they
                    saw when they got over there. And then the West Berliners soon heard what was
                    happening and amazing numbers of them rushed down to the wall. Berlin itself is
                    a huge city in terms of area. We lived within the wall the whole time we were
                    there and rarely saw it all and we traveled a lot. It was lakes and canals and
                    vast expanses. It's a very large area in terms of square miles. So the West
                    Berliners from all areas of the city would rush down to the wall. This would
                    sometimes take them a half hour, an hour to do, to see for themselves what was
                    happening. And many of them spontaneously invited the East Berliners home for
                    dinner, for the night. We heard this again and again from friends who did it.
                    Apocryphal stories of West Berliners giving cars to East Berliners. There was a
                    huge surge of good feeling here, brotherhood, German to German. No violence,
                    even against the guards. The East German guards were still there standing at
                    their posts letting the masses go by. No violence against them. Tremendous
                    happiness, euphoria in fact, lots of honking of cars. Tremendous consumption of
                    alcohol. The bars and the pubs didn't shut that night, or for the whole weekend.
                    In fact the city ran out of booze I think, probably Sunday. And even still no
                    brawls, no rowdiness. It was a very unusual, intoxicating moment. Literally
                    intoxicating, where people acted sensibly and yet with this enormous joy. I have
                    to say, we were swept up in that, even those of us like me, stuck in the office.
                    Ann went down; a lot of my staff went down. I finally got down there on Saturday
                    or Sunday to see it, but by that point the party had peaked. People were
                    starting to come down off the high even though it continued through Sunday. So
                    that's essentially what happened. Then the question was, well, since most of
                    those East Berliners went back, they said we just want to come visit. They went
                    back to their homes, crossed over again. And then they wanted to come back. It
                    quickly became apparent that this whole idea of exit permits and entry permits
                    and visas was absurd and the whole edifice was going to come down. It was only a
                    few days later that the first sections of the wall started coming down. We as
                    allies from the first moment were very closely involved because of our
                    responsibility for security in Berlin. With the West Berlin authorities, but
                    also with the Soviets. I think the most nervous people in this whole event were
                    the Soviets who didn't know really what was going to happen with this huge
                    number of Germans surging around, drinking. Given the history of Soviet-German
                    relations, particularly with the way Berlin had been taken and the way East
                    Germany had been occupied, the Soviets had reason to be concerned that there
                    might be brawls or violence attempted against some of their units somewhere in
                    East Germany or around Berlin. Didn't happen. One reason it didn't happen I
                    think, or one reason why the Soviets didn't overreact, which was perhaps a
                    greater danger, concern they would preempt to do something stupid that would
                    trigger German violence, was the Allies at the minister level, also at the
                    ambassadorial level were able to tell them in Berlin that the Berliners had the
                    situation under control. The Allies had it under control; we were not going to
                    let things get out of hand. We spent a lot of time, we had public safety
                    advisors who were essentially our diplomatic security people, but working with
                    the German police authorities to keep the crowds under control. They never had
                    to deploy force as I recall, but there were a lot of meetings on where the
                    problems might occur. Public safety folk were very, very busy. The military had
                    their own contacts and we did this together. It was USBER and the military in
                    this operation and the Allies also, civilian/military worked hand in glove with
                    this with each other, with the West Berliners. This jurisdictional fuss I
                    mentioned earlier with the commandant and so on really was meaningless in what
                    I'm describing, fortunately because we all worked very closely together. One of
                    the issues that came up, for example, was since this never happened before and
                    since we never war gamed or game planned for something like this, we didn't
                    really know how far it would go or where it would go, but there were lots of
                    points of concern. One was for example the part of the wall that was in front of
                    the Brandenburg gate. It was old concrete and apparently the older concrete gets
                    the harder it becomes. Much harder if it's 20 years old than if it's 10 years
                    old. When it's 30 years old it's even harder and so on and so on. It's a
                    progressive thing. And it was very thick, and nobody quite remembered how the
                    wall had been built there, but the concern was that within this enormously thick
                    concrete wall were reinforced bars, steel girders and taking it down, which the
                    crowd wanted to do, might require heavy equipment. If some West Berliners got
                    the heavy equipment to take down the wall there they might turn around and
                    direct that equipment to the Soviet military monument which is right next door
                    and that would really get the Soviets engaged. And so the fear was disorder
                    which Germans dislike anyway, civil disorder, but particularly civil disorder
                    directed against official Soviet presence like the military monument which had
                    Soviet guards 24 hours a day and so forth. Or other Soviet buildings in Berlin.
                    So a lot of effort was spent to work those issues, to make sure that if heavy
                    equipment had to be used that it was put to civilian use and not to
                    inappropriate use, and that the Soviet missions and presence always had due
                    protection and were respectfully treated. And we were very up front with the
                    Soviets about that. I think those reassurances played a useful role because they
                    had never dealt with this either and they as I said had some reason to be
                    concerned. I don't know of any untoward acts against the Soviets either in East
                    Germany or East Berlin during this period. Or in West Berlin. There may have
                    been somebody who threw a rock, but it would be that low level. That was not the
                    agenda, fortunately, and I think this general euphoria sort of swept people
                    along in another direction, they didn't want to wreak vengeance on folks.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I don't think they had much of a role in this. I mean no disrespect,
                    but I honestly cannot recall dealing with them. I was dealing with my Allied
                    counterparts, our Soviet counterpart; we had one of these impromptu
                    quadripartite chats at USBER one day. The Soviet, Vladimir Grinin was his name.
                    Very fine fellow. He drove over with a colleague from the Soviet embassy and met
                    with I guess the three Allies in our office, just for a chat. They had to take a
                    huge detour because the large crowds were blocking the normal routes of access
                    and they had a car that had Soviet diplomatic plates on it. It was a Soviet car,
                    and they were a little nervous to be honest about it, because they had no
                    protection. They were just there, the two of them, but pleasantly surprised it
                    was going as well as it was. They had not been hassled on the way over. We
                    talked about things, what we were hearing from the Berlin police, and what the
                    projection was. So there were a number of meetings like that, and I think it was
                    handled well, although as I say we had no master plan, we were sort of operating
                    by the seat of our pants, but it came out alright.</p>

                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes. He came for the 750th anniversary of Berlin. This was a huge
                    birthday party that the city wanted to throw for itself. The Reagan
                    administration was heading to elections in a few months and they wanted to throw
                    it to showcase Berlin, to showcase their leadership of the city. And the Allies
                    were very happy to participate, because as I said most of our expenses,
                    certainly our birthday party expenses were paid for by the Bundestag. So we had
                    lots of resources for a tremendous birthday bash. Reagan came; he was in Berlin
                    I think for less than 12 hours. He flew into Tempelhof, he came to the B hall
                    which was the original civilian passenger terminal of Tempelhof for the American
                    birthday for Berlin. Just a little humorous aside. This was 1987. He had been
                    shot six years before. He was in Germany, in Berlin, surrounded by Soviets, the
                    Secret Service went a little goosey, but we got him in there. The B hall was
                    full of people. There was a balloon drop because Mike Deaver liked balloon drops
                    and the President loved them. There was a huge number of balloons in nets
                    waiting to be dropped at the right moment of Reagan's speech. They were
                    apparently close to some source of heat, I guess lights, so Reagan is giving his
                    speech and it's a very charismatic speech, very uplifting, and midway through a
                    sentence is this loud boom that goes off. We didn't know what to make of it, it
                    sounded like a gunshot. We thought, oh my god, somebody is shooting the
                    President, and the Secret Service and everybody else is very nervous. Without
                    missing a beat, Reagan said, “Missed me,” and then went on with his speech. Huge
                    roar and cheer from the crowd. It was great showmanship. But his best
                    showmanship was in front of the Brandenburg gate, outdoors, with a very
                    carefully screened audience of Allied civilians mainly. This was the British
                    sector, but all three sectors were represented. The backdrop was the chancellor
                    of Germany and the ministers of the three Allied powers, the ambassadors and so
                    forth, and that's the speech at which Reagan said “Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this
                    wall.” And there were several sentences addressed rhetorically to Gorbachev in
                    the first person, but “tear down this wall” was the most dramatic one. That made
                    quite an impact apparently among the population to whom it was really addressed,
                    that is the East Germans and others of the east. I think, at the time, I felt
                    and I think a lot of my colleagues felt it was melodramatic, it was too much
                    showmanship, it just wasn't statesmanlike, but I think we were wrong. Looking
                    back on it, if you look at how that sentence is played in retrospective
                    histories of it post-wall it's quite an important event that the head of the
                    free world, the head of the United States government thought it important enough
                    to say to Gorbachev in Berlin, “Tear down this wall,” very principled position.
                    So I would say it was quite famous and more influential than Kennedy's
                    proclamation that he was a jelly-filled doughnut.</p>

                <p>Today is the sixteenth of November, 2004 and we're resuming our conversation
                    about your service as political advisor at the U.S. mission Berlin from 1986 to
                    1990, and I think in our previous conversation Jim, we pretty much talked about
                    what happened before and during the coming down of the wall in November 1989 and
                    maybe we can proceed and talk about the rest of your assignment to Berlin and
                    how much you were involved in the reunification of Germany and the diplomatic
                    negotiations that went on to that goal, of course things specific to Berlin.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: When the wall fell that November 9th, it quickly became more and more
                    porous as more and more pedestrian and vehicular traffic crossed over in both
                    directions. So it was rapidly clear to everybody, including the Soviets, that
                    the reunification of the city and of Germany was a matter of time. Some of the
                    Allies wanted the time to be longer, some shorter, but nobody disagreed about
                    reunification, to which we were all formally pledged, including the Soviet Union
                    by the way, that it was coming much more quickly than any of us had imagined a
                    few weeks before. After the new crossing points were opened, basically by
                    removing large hunks of the wall so that people could go through it unimpeded
                    and drive through it also, more so than they had been able to do for almost 28
                    years, there was a lot of traffic back and forth. Seeing East Berliners in West
                    Berlin became normal and having West Berliners look around East Berlin was
                    normal too. Now formally the quadripartite status of the city remained and the
                    responsibilities of the three western Allies and the Soviet Union were
                    unchanged. We continued our regular meetings, the three westerners and then at
                    various levels the ministers and the political advisors would meet with their
                    Soviet counterparts to conduct business, to exchange notes, basically to
                    reassure the Soviets in many ways that this process of rapid change which makes
                    any status quo power nervous was working peacefully and not likely to lead to
                    their detriment, physical or otherwise. I think we mentioned in our last
                    conversation that there was initial concern by some of the Soviet leaders in
                    Germany, particularly the military leadership that these surging crowds of happy
                    Germans might for various reasons turn suddenly on the Soviet garrisons that
                    were all over East Germany. As far as I know that never happened. There was no
                    retribution visited on either the Soviets as an occupying power or on the East
                    German authorities who had been perceived in the West as their puppets for many,
                    many years. There may have been some score settlement at a very low level, but
                    it never came to my attention in Berlin. So we were very pleased that and I
                    think we can take a slight amount of credit for that, making sure there was no
                    overreaction by either the Berlin authorities or by the Soviets camped around
                    the city and throughout East Germany. The calendar of events then became
                    dominated. The Christmas season of course was approaching, but there were other
                    things that had to be done. One was to open the wall at the Brandenburg gate.
                    The Brandenburg gate, next to the Berlin bear, is the symbol, historically, of
                    Berlin. It had been closed since the wall had been constructed. In fact, there
                    was a massively thick and tall wall right in front of the gate. The gate was on
                    the East Berlin side of the city, in the Soviet sector as we called it, and had
                    been the backdrop for many events, including President Reagan's 1987 address to
                    the German people. And Mr. Gorbachev whom he implored to tear down this wall. So
                    the Brandenburg gate had tremendous significance. It was really a question of
                    engineering and working out how best to safely remove some of those huge
                    partitions, and then letting the crowds come through in an orderly way. As I
                    recall, the word went out that the gate would be open. That is, that the wall
                    would be lifted near the gate on December 22, 1989, a very rainy, overcast day
                    as is typical in that part of Europe in the winter, throughout the year for that
                    matter. Crowds amassed, including the commandants and the POLADs and the
                    ministers and a whole lot of other people on the western side. And then I forget
                    how the signal was given, but at some point around three that afternoon the
                    crowds surged forward and for the first time ever most of us foreigners at
                    least, found ourselves walking under and through the Brandenburg gate and
                    looking at its decorations. We'd only seen them from afar because it had not
                    been accessible from the eastern side either because of its special significance
                    in proximity to the wall. That was quite an exciting event. It was also the day,
                    as I recall, when Leonard Bernstein dramatically showed up in Berlin. He had
                    been, as millions around the world had, moved by the sudden surge toward German
                    unity, and decided to come and conduct a concert in the Berlin philharmonic hall
                    which is also near the wall, of Beethoven's ninth, and he did. And it was quite
                    a concert.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I was not there, but I saw it. It was a great success. Well-attended,
                    and we have parts of it on videotape, so vicariously we live that experience
                    from time to time. Particularly the fourth movement, the choral movement, where
                    they speak of joy that makes all men brothers. And indeed that seemed to be the
                    feeling that the Germans had themselves, as well as everybody else. It was a
                    time of great joy, jubilation, embracing one's fellow man. That all has passed
                    now and the euphoria dissipated fairly quickly, but at that time, those first
                    weeks and months after November 9 it was undiminished and the crowds that surged
                    toward the Brandenburg gate that December afternoon were certainly strong
                    witness to that assertion. There was a huge celebration on New Year's Eve at the
                    Brandenburg gate with lots of fireworks and drinking and shouting and yelling.
                    People actually climbed on top of the Brandenburg gate which was dangerous
                    because it's fairly high. It was a stable structure but it had not been built
                    for drunken revelers to climb around. I don't think anybody died that night, but
                    there were some injuries from minor falls. Anyway, more jubilation, more
                    goodwill, more celebration of what was coming. And the next months of 1990 were
                    basically an unfolding of further steps as the wall continued to be dismantled.
                    Dismantling the wall was a huge undertaking because the total length of the
                    wall, because of the size of the city of Berlin, in particular the size of the
                    three western sectors which had significant lakes and canals as part of their
                    territory, or the border, to put a wall around that required a structure of I
                    think about 120 kilometers. Not the whole city, the Soviet sector, East Berlin,
                    was not part of it, but ringing the western sectors of Berlin including the
                    lakes in the southwest and the north took a lot of doing, and dismantling that
                    thing. A lot of volunteers helped, including tourists, my wife, my daughter.
                    Everybody got a hammer and chisels and went to work, and they earned themselves
                    the nickname of wall woodpeckers because you could hear this chink, chink, chink
                    noise up and down the wall, day and night. It was like the locusts here every 17
                    years, or the cicadas. It just was on and on and on. But still it took a long
                    time. This was old cement, it was well-built, and it was massive and very, very
                    long. Parts of it stand today, but mainly under historical protection for
                    reminding future generations.</p>

                <p>WILLIAMS: We shipped back several hundred pounds through the pouch of genuinely
                    harvested parts of the Berlin wall. The demand seemed insatiable because
                    everybody wanted some, and the pieces that had parts of the murals or the
                    frescoes or paint on them were particularly prized because they were the outside
                    part of the wall. Interestingly enough, the murals were only on the side
                    pointing toward the west because that was the only side that was accessible to
                    the graffiti artists and the others. On the eastern side the East German
                    authorities kept people away. They didn't want them approaching that wall so
                    there was virtually no graffiti on that side at all. Huge chunks of the wall, as
                    you know, were lifted away and ceremoniously given to the Bush library, to the
                    Reagan library, to other prominent libraries and institutions around the world,
                    and today very little remains. The formal structure of the quadripartite status
                    of Berlin and the occupation regime had not yet changed. We decommissioned
                    Checkpoint Charlie shortly before our tour ended in the summer of 1990.
                    Checkpoint Charlie was the main crossing point in the American sector at the
                    wall that was created after the wall was built. The decommissioning involved the
                    lifting by crane of the house where the guards had sat for decades to another
                    site, and then giving away pieces of the large gravel that underlay it. The
                    foreign ministers came, Secretary Baker was there, Douglas Heard was there, the
                    French foreign minister and quite a few others. It was a major ceremony in which
                    we were at the mission involved heavily in preparing the way logistically. There
                    were other events of that kind. There was a quadripartite meeting of ambassadors
                    for the first time in many years. Vernon Walters was our ambassador in Bonn and
                    he and the two Allies met with their Soviet counterpart from East Berlin for a
                    general review of how things were going. This happened about February, March as
                    I recall, of 1990. I was not at the meeting; Harry Gilmore was involved as an
                    advisor. The meeting was in Berlin at the old Allied control council building,
                    which essentially had been vacant since the Allied control council stopped
                    meeting after the Soviets walked out of it in the late 1940s. But with unity
                    coming, with so much changing so rapidly and given the stakes the decision was
                    to hold a meeting. As far as I recall it only met once, in a somewhat formal
                    sense as to reassert visibly the authority of the control council for Berlin
                    with the four power controlled council, and I don't believe it ever met again at
                    that level.</p>
                <p>It seemed to me that our meetings with members of the Soviet embassy in East
                    Berlin remained at a much more frequent rate for the balance of my tour there.
                    We always met with them regularly, as I said in earlier sessions, at my level,
                    at the minister's level, and when the ambassador would come up from Bonn he
                    would almost always meet with the Soviet ambassador from East Berlin in a
                    bilateral where I would take notes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the meetings at your level were also generally at a
                        bilateral level with the Soviet embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Usually. We had a rotating system among the three western Allies where
                    one of us was the Ally in charge for the month, so to speak, and one of our
                    months was November. So we were in charge when the wall fell, and Harry Gilmore
                    had the duty and the honor to inform the other ministers and the ambassador in
                    Bonn and the commandant and coordinate our response to that first frenzied
                    activity. So usually the chairman of the month would meet with the Soviet
                    counterpart. All of us had the same Soviet counterpart in these years; his name
                    was Vladimir Grinin, a real German expert, about our age, very attractive man
                    with a very attractive wife, spoke excellent German. We conversed in German
                    because that was the language that we all had best. Some of my colleagues knew
                    Russian, I didn't know a word. But we socialized a bit with them at the
                    quadripartite Allied festivities such as the ball of the Berlin air safety
                    center which would be held each winter. There were other events that were
                    celebrated by Soviet entities in West Berlin where we would see Grinin
                    informally from time to time. We got to know each other fairly well. He proposed
                    early on that we converse using the informal German “you”. Which was quite a
                    step. He was, to my surprise, very comfortable with that, we certainly were, and
                    he was Vladia, I was Jim, and Roland and Jeane-Paul. There were four of us. I
                    would say we had a good time. It was always professional. We could joke around
                    with each other. We got business done pretty quickly. We continued the rotation
                    of Ally of the month and that person had the main responsibility for being in
                    contact that month with Grinin, either in West Berlin or in East Berlin at the
                    Soviet embassy. We met in both places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To what extent were you involved during this transition
                        period with the U.S. embassy in East Berlin? I think we had talked about
                        that a little bit before, but obviously their days were coming to an end and
                        I don't know at what point the embassy and the mission began to in effect
                        come together.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: That really happened after I left in August of 1990. We always had
                    regular meetings with the ambassador and the DCM at the embassy in East Berlin.
                    But even though we were all in the same city, our missions were almost entirely
                    different. They never had any responsibility for the quadripartite issues, for
                    dealing with the Soviets about Berlin that was our bread and butter. They dealt
                    with the East German government which for us was an illegal presence in East
                    Berlin and we never dealt with the East German authorities unless it was an
                    emergency when somebody had to receive first aid in an auto accident on the
                    Autobahn in East Germany or in Eastern Berlin. So there was almost total
                    division of labor, but after November 9 I think there was more regular contact
                    between particularly Harry Gilmore the minister in West Berlin and the
                    ambassador Dick Barkley in East Berlin. Personalities aside, there was I think
                    institutionally a bit of chafing between an embassy which was accredited to a
                    government but not responsible for the capital city of that government and a
                    mission which was responsible for the whole city which included the capital city
                    of the government whose authority it did not recognize in the city and there was
                    from time to time inevitably some friction. And some duplicate reporting which I
                    think on the whole was a plus because there were different sides of the elephant
                    to report back to Washington. But in terms of coming together, that was a matter
                    of great sensitivity which our chief of mission in Bonn handled because as
                    German unity was coming it was quite clear there would no longer be a need for
                    an embassy in East Berlin because the GDR was going to be melded out of
                    existence into the larger Germany. The decision was made essentially in
                    Washington to have embassy Bonn coordinate the coming together of mission
                    Berlin, USBER and embassy Berlin. And that inevitably meant some people would go
                    and some people would stay, and that decision was made ultimately in Bonn by
                    George Ward the DCM and Vernon Walters the chief of mission. And inevitably
                    there was some resentment and great disappointment by some of the members of the
                    embassy in Berlin. More so than my members of mission Berlin. There were more of
                    us, not that we were better, and not all of us say it either, but this all
                    happened after I left and I only know this from hearing it from a lot of
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the procedural innovations I suppose in the
                        diplomacy of German reunification was the four plus two, the quadripartite
                        powers, the United States, Great Britain, France, and the Soviet Union, and
                        the German Federal Republic and the German Democratic Republic. Did that all
                        start after you had left, or did that really not affect Berlin as such.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It didn't affect me. It started before I left, but I was not involved.
                    Harry Gilmore was tangentially involved, but most of that diplomacy was run out
                    of Bonn by all three of the western powers, and then working with the Soviet
                    embassy, in East Berlin, not the Soviet embassy in Bonn. But I don't recall
                    aside again from the logistical responsibilities we had for setting up the venue
                    for some of these meetings, I don't recall any major role by USBER in that time.
                    And of course, after we left there was a lot more of it because we left in
                    August and German unity came about a year later, so there was an intensive
                    negotiation from '90 to '91, but it really didn't involve me.</p>

                        note for the record a book that I've read that I think was really quite
                        excellent by Condoleezza Rice who perhaps today will be named Secretary of
                        State and her coauthor is Philip Zelikow who is well-known lately for being
                        the executive director of the 9/11 Commission and it really discusses the
                        four plus two talks, what Secretary Baker's involvement, all sorts of
                        aspects. It's fairly detailed. I don't remember the title, but it came out
                        about 10 years ago, eight years ago, something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Harry Gilmore wrote an op-ed piece in the Baltimore Sun that came out
                    on November 9 this year. This is the fifteenth anniversary of the fall of the
                    wall. It was a short piece, but it recounted his, he was the Allied chairman for
                    that month, November. His experiences dealing with the governing mayor of
                    Berlin, Walter Momper, social democrat, and the commandant Ray Haddock, and the
                    Allies and Ambassador Walters that night. And it's quite an interesting
                    vignette. The main issue that night was the Berlin police, the West Berlin
                    police, wanted authority to approach the wall and maintain order and restore it
                    when necessary. And the issue was, and the reason they came to us was, the wall
                    was off-limits to them. It stood on the territory of the Soviet sector or of
                    East Germany, depending on where it was located, but they had no legal right to
                    touch it. In fact we had been very firm in telling them to stay the hell away
                    from it, that it was our responsibility as the occupying powers for many, many
                    years. But given the extraordinary circumstances these tens and tens of
                    thousands of Germans surging forth, there was a correctly perceived need to
                    maintain order lest things get out of hand. So in a period of an hour or two,
                    Harry gave Momper the authorization as soon as he called and then back-briefed
                    the French and British ministers and the commandant and the embassy in Bonn.
                    Things were just going too fast to hold a formal meeting in the Kommandatura and
                    decide this issue. Momper was very happy to get that authority. And the Berlin
                    police, working very closely with the Allies, made good use of that authority.
                    They didn't climb all over the wall and they kept people off the wall as long as
                    they could. It wasn't entirely possible as we know from the pictures, but it was
                    just an indication of how closely and well we worked together in those turbulent
                    days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, anything else you would want to say about your
                        assignment to Berlin before we go on to your next posting?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: There are three things I just want to highlight very briefly from my
                    four years in Berlin. As I said before I was initially very surprised as to the
                    comity that existed between the Soviet Union whom we were still calling the evil
                    empire in those days and the Allied powers in Berlin. The surprise was my own
                    lack of background in Berlin when I got there, but it reflected a general desire
                    by all four powers not to have any trouble in Berlin. With the signing of the
                    quadripartite agreement in the early 1970s they had taken that step that they no
                    longer wanted Berlin to be a flashpoint of the Cold War. And so sometimes there
                    was trouble given the circumstances of the division of the city, the division of
                    Germany, the garrisoning of West Germany and East Germany by large numbers of
                    Allied forces and Russian forces, and the spying by one side on the other that
                    was also sanctioned as part of the post-war agreements. Inevitably there was
                    friction. I mentioned last time Major Nicholson was shot and allowed to bleed to
                    death because a Soviet sentry kept first aid from being rendered. Another MLM,
                    military liaison mission, person was shot when I was there. But every time
                    something like that happened it was quickly handled through channels and never
                    escalated to a crisis over Berlin. Nobody wanted any trouble. Whenever refugees,
                    East Berliners or East Germans, tried to cross the wall and got killed or shot
                    or whatever there was a lot of public outrage, political concern, but it never
                    escalated to the point of crisis simply because we had learned a lesson in the
                    '40s and '50s we didn't want one. So from the management of the Berlin air
                    regime, to handling incidents at the wall, or even more trivial things such as
                    when an Allied military vehicle would break down in the eastern sector of
                    Berlin, the Soviets could be counted on to be helpful within reason. They
                    wouldn't do everything, but they generally would be helpful because it was in
                    their interest to do so. Even when Reagan came in 1987, this was my baptism into
                    this, the decision was made to have him speak in front of the Brandenburg gate
                    and to walk up close to the wall and even stand on the area next to the wall
                    where the footing was placed. This is what the Germans called the untabaugabe.
                    Once again, this is technically, legally, juridically part of the Soviet sector
                    of Berlin and this would be a violation. But I told Grinin our Soviet
                    counterpart what was going to happen. I said he was going to walk up there; this
                    was a visit, that's all it is. I wasn't asking permission, I was simply telling
                    him, and his reaction indicated there was not going to be any problem from the
                    Soviet side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you tell your counterpart what President Reagan was
                        going to say?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I didn't know, I did not preview the speech. But this could have been a
                    delicate thing. The Secret Service had sharpshooters posted on top of the
                    Reichstag which is very close to the Brandenburg gate and on other points of
                    high ground nearby to protect the president. As I recall also brief greeting on
                    that simply as to let him know there would be armed personnel with sniper scopes
                    up there just in case something untoward happened. As I recall, the day of the
                    visit itself when Reagan was there, there was no Soviet to be seen, the East
                    Germans were out of sight. It was as if it was a dead man zone on the other side
                    of the wall. And fortunately everything went off very smoothly. I think that's
                    sort of informal or formal discussion to put them on notice so we could reassure
                    them and also make sure they did the right thing, or didn't do the wrong thing
                    in anticipating something that didn't happen. So Soviet-Allied cooperation in
                    Berlin was extraordinary, even to the personal level, the whole time I was
                    there. And that was a very big plus in managing the issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that continued through the very turbulent period of
                        1989.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It did. Walters would meet with the Soviet ambassador regularly. As I
                    said, Kotchamasov was the first one. Smirin I think was the second ambassador.
                    They always spoke Russian, sometimes we used German, Walters spoke all these
                    languages, and fortunately for me he did a lot of his business in German so I
                    could take the notes, otherwise Harry would have had to take the notes because
                    he spoke Russian.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>The second issue I wanted to mention very briefly is the question of budget. I
                    think it's important to note that the bundestag, the German legislature in Bonn,
                    approved a huge budget for the three western Allies each year. Aside from
                    salaries and all other expenses, all of our operational costs in Berlin,
                    military and civilian, were born by the occupation cost budget approved by the
                    bundestag. Now it went through the normal internal control channels in Bonn.
                    There was a liaison system set up in Berlin and in Bonn, between the embassies
                    and the bundestag, but it didn't go through the congress and it didn't go
                    through our OMB or OPM or any of the other American alphabet agencies. So it was
                    a sui generous arrangement. We had very stringent budgetary years in this period
                    in Washington, so it was a generous budget for us. The missions in Berlin,
                    military and civilian, were very well-equipped. Deliberately so. Not only did we
                    want to showcase Berlin as a city of freedom and success, we wanted to make
                    active use of those assets. So we had created over the years extraordinary
                    training facilities for the military to use, and extraordinary conference
                    facilities for the mission to use, so whenever there was a chiefs of mission
                    conference in Germany or in Europe, they almost always came to Berlin because we
                    had the facilities, we had the personnel, we had the assets and the
                    infrastructure to support it, and we did. Many of the military units, army units
                    in Europe, mainly USEUR, U.S. Army Europe, came to Berlin for specialized
                    training in inner city warfare which is now so topical with the battles raging
                    in Iraq and other things, and the standard of excellence they achieved there was
                    really quite extraordinary, because once again the equipment was first rate and
                    we had the space to do it. We also didn't have, quite honestly, as many
                    environmental concerns in Berlin as the army was facing in West Germany. There
                    were some, very articulately and loudly sometimes, but ultimately we had the
                    upper hand in Berlin, we didn't in Germany when it came to that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that's an important point you're making. Let me
                        ask you though, to what extent did you exercise some restraint, and were
                        there controls in place. Was it sort of sky's the limit unlimited, tennis
                        court in every backyard?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: First of all, we had requisitioned when the army first came into Berlin
                    in July of '45 some very large and well-preserved properties. The Soviets had
                    beaten the hell out of the city when they took it. So what became the Soviet
                    sector of Berlin, and these lines of division had been drawn in the years before
                    the war ended, the heart of the city and the eastern sector were pretty well
                    obliterated. By the luck of the draw we had a sector that went down to the
                    southwestern sector of the city, which was not the direction from which the
                    Soviets advanced on the city, although they had enveloped the whole thing. There
                    were a lot of properties still intact in our sector, the British sector, and the
                    French sector. And these were expensive to maintain. They were requisitioned so
                    they formally still belonged to the German state or to the German families who
                    had once lived there, but their maintenance was expensive and that was
                    considered a legitimate expense by the cost of the occupation budget. Restraint
                    was used, but it was a different kind of restraint. We wanted to maintain a
                    certain level of excellence and the Germans wanted us to have that excellence.
                    It wasn't that this was rammed down the throat of the bundestag, although
                    inevitably questions were asked about it in the bundestag. These questions
                    became more and more pointed as decade after decade after decade went on and the
                    war became a rather distant memory. So every year we had more questions to
                    answer as to how this money was being spent and why so much money was needed for
                    the three Allies. The embassy in Bonn handled that liaison with the bundestag,
                    but in order to better handle it, and frankly to give a better image of our
                    commitment to serious internal controls, the embassy created something called
                    the Berlin budget management office, BBMO. This was run by Dan Tholl I think, a
                    recently retired FSO with admin and bookkeeping credentials that were quite
                    significant. And they reviewed the budget for the American sector before it was
                    submitted as part of the Allied budget to the federal authorities who submitted
                    it to the bundestag. And that was a much more serious review when the BBMO came
                    in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that in Bonn or Berlin or Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It worked out of the embassy in Bonn but they came up often to Berlin
                    and they had an office in the mission too as I recall. And that was necessary
                    because quite honestly there had been inevitably some excesses. There had been a
                    scandal some years before that the British were running a stable of polo ponies
                    in the British sector near the Olympic stadium and paying for it out of the
                    occupation cost budget. So when the polo pony scandal hit the ponies were
                    quickly retired, sent back to Britain, taken off the occupation cost budget. We
                    never had ponies, but we had morale and recreation welfare type things. Large
                    boats that were floating around the Wannsee, motorized for the morale of the
                    troops, and the troops used them, and the commandant had a private yacht which
                    he shared with the minister and POLAD (political advisor) occasionally. For
                    essentially representational activity, but also recreational activity. So there
                    was a lot of that and one could quibble about how much of that was excess and
                    how much not. The difficulty for us in the American sector was we had so much
                    more than our colleagues at the embassy in Bonn. Again the constraints of the
                    United States federal budget meant that the embassy in Bonn was living on a very
                    short leash. At one point, the first year I was there '86, '87 they had to give
                    up a lot of subscriptions to professional magazines, newspapers, because they
                    just couldn't afford them it got that bad. Although it was strictly speaking a
                    violation of the budget we I think wound up buying some subscriptions for them,
                    we had the money, we thought that was the right thing to do. Needless to say, it
                    did not endear us to our colleagues in Bonn because they knew we had the
                    capability and resented the fact that they didn't. And they were right to.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To what extent was their budgetary coordination with the
                        other two Allies? You mention the Berlin budget management office dealing
                        with the bundestag, or with the German finance ministry. Did you all try to
                        make sure you were kind of in sync a little bit with the French and the
                        British?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I think we did, but I don't recall any intensive coordination in
                    Berlin. Certainly it never was done at my level. None of my discussions ever
                    involved budgetary coordination and I don't think the ministers did either,
                    either John Kornblum's or Harry Gilmore's. I think this was handled through the
                    embassies in Bonn, working with the finance ministry and through the ministry
                    the bundestag. But a subset of this, and it's the final point I want to mention
                    because it's historically relevant, is we had in the American sector some
                    enormous, historically significant buildings that were in very bad shape. One
                    was the Prussian Supreme Court which was the locus of the Berlin air safety
                    center which had a very small part of a cavernous building. One was the building
                    where the Kommandatura met; it was originally an insurance building, later a
                    bank, but a historically significant building. One was Tempelhof Airport, huge
                    airport built by the Nazis, surrounded by the city, but with large areas. There
                    were various residences and there were other buildings too. Most of the
                    buildings had been public buildings under the Prussians, then under the Nazis,
                    and were used by our people. We, late in the occupation era, that is we'd been
                    maintaining the buildings all along, or trying to. But they reached such a point
                    of general dilapidation in the 1980s that a very imaginative admin officer at
                    the mission, Mike McLaughlin, came up with the idea of seriously reconstructing
                    these buildings to preserve them for posterity against the day when unity came.
                    At this point we didn't know that unity was right around the corner, but to fix
                    the leaky roofs, to repair the hazardous wiring, to make the plumbing stacks
                    operate again, to really upgrade these buildings and make them useable if not by
                    the Allies then by somebody else, perhaps by German authorities when unity came.
                    So this was done, as I recall, primarily in the American sector, and it involved
                    a massive increase in our budget allocation which went roughly from '85 to '90
                    from five million dollars to 20, 25 million marks maybe per year. It went up
                    five fold because of this building maintenance and upgrade program. The
                    historical facades were maintained, when necessary they were renewed, the
                    internal workings were gutted and replaced, and we basically tried to make those
                    buildings fully functional and useable when the time came. We didn't have
                    immediate need for it, and Mike was in retrospect clairvoyant that the need
                    would be coming very soon, but we had a huge part of commercial real estate and
                    public real estate available for German authorities to use when unity came. It
                    was a huge operation. Mike basically ran it, keeping the embassy informed using
                    German contractors, German material, so it was done to a very high standard, and
                    that was impressive to see because nobody had either thought of this before or
                    had the bureaucratic fortitude to put it through. Mike seized the opportunity
                    and made the most of it, and it's quite a credit I think to the American and
                    indeed the Allied occupation there at the end at least, that so much of that
                    real estate was ready when unity came.</p>

                        addressed this right at the beginning of our discussion of your assignment
                        in Berlin. You were political advisor, you were POLAD for short. POLADs in
                        major commands advise the commander, you did that, but in a different way.
                        Were there aspects of your responsibilities that would be traditional POLAD
                        or it was all pretty unique?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Well, I think it's both. We were all part of an occupation regime and
                    formally became part of the army command post at Clay headquarters. We were in
                    protocol terms in the chain of command. I never had command authority over
                    troops, but in the absence of the commandant the minister would be acting
                    commandant for political purposes and protocol purposes. In the absence of both
                    of them, I was the acting commandant. Again, never with line authority over
                    troops, but for representing the American sector, vis-a-vis the other Allies,
                    vis-a-vis the Berliners, vis-a-vis anybody else, the baton passed to us. I was
                    also supposed to, and did, give political advice and other advice to the
                    commandant and my colleagues in the command; the chief of staff was an important
                    one. The head of the air force presence, air force colonel was another. There
                    was a lot of coordination through regularly scheduled meetings each day, each
                    week, between the USBER and the military. The commandant chaired these as the
                    senior American official in Berlin. In his absence it would be sometimes the
                    minister. It sort of passed around. But usually the commandant was there. And
                    these meetings were fairly free flowing. We attended the meetings and then we
                    had our own staff meetings to which the commandant and the chief of staff or one
                    of his advisors would always come. So there was healthy coordination, we cleared
                    cables for each other and this sort of thing. I think with John Mitchell who was
                    the commandant when we got there it worked very smoothly. John and his wife Joan
                    took their representational responsibilities seriously. John certainly was an
                    able military commander, but he did not try to run the political analysis and
                    reporting that USBER did. He accepted this natural division of labor, which had
                    existed for a long time. Not always harmoniously, but generally speaking. And
                    under John Mitchell it was very harmonious. We were very respectful of his
                    authority and responsibilities and he was very respectful of ours. The last
                    commandant, John's successor, was Ray Haddock, and he had a much more
                    MacArthur-esque approach to running things. He had successfully presided over
                    the deployment of the 104 Persian missiles in southwest Germany in the '80s,
                    major success for U.S. diplomacy. He had spent a lot of time dealing with
                    Germans, trying to overcome public resistance to that deployment. Spoke pretty
                    good German. Married to a German. And he came to Berlin with a mission to really
                    assert the authority of the USCAB in all respects, and so it was not as
                    harmonious with him. But when the crunch came, when we really had to work
                    together and pull together November 9 and so on, we absolutely did. So these
                    frictions were at a much more superficial level than I perhaps had indicated.
                    But I always would give advice and John Mitchell and then Ray Haddock were free
                    to accept or reject it, and vice versa. They were always welcome to opine on
                    things as well, but we were free to accept that or reject it within our area of
                    competence. Just to give you one example and I have a great affection for both
                    these commandants although Ray might not fully agree with that. I saw them both,
                    and their wives, at the fall of the wall party at the German embassy Saturday
                    night. We'd get together each year around the 9th of November, German embassy
                    hosted and for very little money, I think about $40, everybody who was a
                    Berliner or a friend of one could go and have a great time with authentic German
                    food and drink and see old friends and reminisce. And both John Mitchell and Ray
                    Haddock were there with their wives. But just to give you one example of how
                    things had changed, there was some issue that happened involving the governance
                    of West Berlin and Ray decided he would send a private note to the governing
                    mayor who was Walter Momper at this time, telling him that whatever it was was a
                    bad idea and he didn't think he should do it. It was a private note, it wasn't a
                    dictate, and it was not a press release of any kind. He sent him a private note
                    trying to counsel him. I'm sure John Mitchell had never done that and it had
                    been a long time since any commandant had, and Ray had never done it, and we had
                    never heard about it which tells you how things were. USBER was not informed,
                    but I was called in by Momper's chief of staff, a lawyer who had been plucked
                    out of the university to run things, a very able fellow. He told me that the
                    governing mayor had received this letter, did not plan to respond to it, did not
                    want it in the senate, and he gave it back to me. He said we don't like to be
                    counseled that way. So I had the unenviable task of returning the letter to its
                    sender with the message that accompanied it. I faithfully did that. And that was
                    the end of it as far as I knew. But these things added up. This was just one
                    case, but there were other little things. But again at the end of the day when
                    we really had to pull together in the sector among the three sectors with the
                    Berliners and the Germans and the Soviets, all that went away.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I had decided after staying in Berlin for so long and enjoying it so
                    much that I really wanted to continue that type of work if possible, and that
                    inevitably meant that I was going to seek a DCMship in some large embassy. I had
                    had conversations before I went to Berlin about possibly going to Greece or
                    Turkey. I had served in Turkey, I spoke Greek still, served in Cyprus, never in
                    Greece, but I was looking at the DCMships in Ankara and Athens, trying to take
                    advantage of my earlier experience and language training. It seems to me I
                    arranged to be back in Washington when the new politically appointed ambassador,
                    Michael Sotirhos from New York was going out to Greece. He was in Washington on
                    consultations prior to going out, and that's when he interviewed me. I went in
                    expecting to have about a half hour of the man's time. I knew there were other
                    candidates waiting to be interviewed some time while he was there. I didn't know
                    who they were exactly or when they were going to see him. I'd never met him
                    before although I'd heard he was a businessman from New York City, which barely
                    scratched the surface.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>Michael is still alive; he is a Greek-American, first generation. His parents
                    came from the Greek islands and he grew up in very modest circumstances in New
                    York City. Went to CCNY, became a successful interior designer, got into
                    commercial real estate and other investments, and in short became a multi,
                    multi-millionaire by the time he was 50 years old. Had two children, had a wife
                    who was also Greek-American. Very hardworking people. I think they drove
                    themselves as hard as they drove their staff, but had this tremendous
                    workaholism, and that quickly became apparent in the interview. After about five
                    minutes of pleasantries, and he was quite cordial, he asked if we could switch
                    to Greek. At this time, I had not spoken Greek seriously for years, I hadn't had
                    any refresher. I'd been speaking German for the past four years, and found
                    myself having to answer questions essentially with very short replies, using the
                    vocabulary I was able to dredge up through my brain. We talked about his concept
                    of leadership and loyalty. Loyalty was very important to him, loyalty upward as
                    well as downward. We talked about that. I think he chose me among other reasons
                    because I had never served in Greece. He was strongly suspicious of Foreign
                    Service officers, or perhaps generally, but particularly Foreign Service
                    officers who'd had a tour in Greece and wanted another. He thought their reasons
                    were suspect, that they had been perhaps corrupted by the delights of being in
                    Greece, the Levantine charms of the climate, the women, the weather, whatever.
                    And some of the other candidates had had that experience. They were very strong
                    candidates. Had better Greek than I did. Certainly had had the executive
                    credentials I had had, but I had never served in Greece and it became apparent
                    to me in that interview that was important to him. And serving in Cyprus was one
                    thing, didn't count against me, but not serving in Greece certainly counted for
                    me. And so the interview went on for about four hours. Fortunately I had not had
                    much coffee and I had gone to the men's room before it started, but by the time
                    it was over I was ready to leave, let's put it that way. And then he interviewed
                    some other people, I left and went back to Berlin and never heard anything from
                    anybody. Finally I called him in Athens just to ask how it was going and to say
                    I'm still interested in the job if you're still interested in having me. He was
                    very noncommittal, very courteous, but he said he still was considering people.
                    He either told me then or told me later that he was under pressure to consider
                    what we euphemistically call in personnel diversity candidates, women and
                    minorities, to be candid about it. I'm sure the system had some candidates. And
                    it wasn't until that spring as I recall, March maybe April, when I finally got
                    the assignment. Athens came through, so we were very happy about that. I called
                    and thanked him, and said look forward to working with you in Athens, and he
                    said look forward to having you here. He had made some comments about his
                    predecessor Bob Keeley whom he didn't like for some reason. Perhaps that's a
                    common affliction that political ambassadors have when they succeed a career
                    ambassador. Sometimes works vice versa too. In any case, we had a very cordial
                    introduction to each other and I think in retrospect he handled the selection
                    process very well. I know that he grilled everybody as thoroughly as he grilled
                    me. It was a long, long session. Four hours at least. Dave Ransom was surprised
                    at how thorough it was. I think I was the first one in the queue just because of
                    the way the scheduling worked out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did that take place again?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I think that was in the fall of 1989, or the summer. He went out that
                    fall so it was probably when I was back on leave July or August. Before the wall
                    fell. At that point I couldn't brag about having brought an end to the Berlin
                    wall, but I could tell him about the occupation cost budget because I thought he
                    would be impressed by how large a budget the American sector had, and other
                    things I was doing. It was a friendly meeting; it was certainly a substantive
                    discussion, and one of the most thorough meetings I've ever had with anybody on
                    any subject. He took due diligence seriously as he had taken everything,
                    business deals and everything else. I saw this again and again when I was in
                    Athens with him. He really went into things in a very thorough way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think I first met him in Cyprus about 1981, '82, early
                        in the Reagan administration, and I know he had been very much involved in
                        fundraising, particularly with ethnic communities I think, for that
                        election. I don't know if he took a position in the administration, but he
                        was certainly close to the counselor during the Reagan period, Edward
                        Derwinski, then he was ambassador to Jamaica. That was just before Athens,
                        correct? Very early part of the Bush administration.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: He had four years in the Reagan administration as ambassador to
                    Jamaica, and then when Bush came in he was one of the few political ambassadors
                    kept by Bush which was a big surprise to a lot of people who thought as
                    Republican ambassadors they might be carried over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he was the latter part of the Reagan administration and
                        very early part of the Bush administration, but he was in Kingston and was
                        selected to go to Athens.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: He told me that his expertise had been, aside from the fact he was a
                    committed Republican and believed deeply in the principles of the party, his
                    expertise had been organizing ethnic groups of all kinds for Republicans.
                    Greek-Americans for Reagan, Turkish-Americans for Reagan. He showed me the pins
                    once. He had Arab-Americans, any conceivable hyphenate group you could imagine
                    had a pin for Republicans. For Reagan, for Bush. And he had done that very well,
                    bringing his tremendous drive and organizational skills to bear and had been
                    rewarded first of all with Jamaica for that. Then when Bush came in, he knew
                    Bush very well also, got Athens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think in the early part of the Reagan administration
                        before going to Jamaica I believe he had a position in the White House for a
                        period. Is that possible?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: He was with somebody in the White House doing something but I cannot
                    remember what it was. He was certainly close to Ed Derwinski.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Faith Whittlesey maybe who twice was ambassador to
                        Switzerland in the Reagan administration, but also had a White House
                        position.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It's possible, but I never heard him mention her and she never came to
                    Athens when he was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So anyway, you got to Athens.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: In August of 1990 as I recall. I called the ambassador as soon as I got
                    to a phone the next day. He invited us over to the residence to the swimming
                    pool for a get acquainted session. Estelle was there, their children were not
                    there. Ann and Laura and I went over for what became a four or five hour
                    discussion/swim/lunch at the swimming pool. This time it was all in English
                    fortunately so it was much easier for Ann and Laura.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A question that has popped into my head over the years is
                        he was the first Greek-American U.S. ambassador to Greece I believe. How was
                        he received? I was in Italy with John Volpe one of the first
                        Italian-Americans to come there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I think the Greeks were initially in awe of Sotirhos, cowed by him. He
                    has a very strong personality, fluent Greek, fluent English, and able to chew
                    people up or argue a case one way or the other with tremendous force. It's an
                    overpowering personality when he comes on strong as I saw him do many times. The
                    reason he had been suspicious of FSOs who wanted to go back to Greece a second
                    time was he was certainly a Greek and took that seriously, but he was
                    contemptuous of much of what modern Greece had become. The sloppiness, the
                    filth, the lack of discipline, the inefficiency. The list went on and on. WASPs
                    (White Anglo Saxon Protestants) like me would consider some of those things
                    charming and part of the atmospheric delight of Greece, but Michael Sotirhos and
                    Estelle as well, she was Greek-American also, had a very hard line about some of
                    these things. They correctly pointed out, and some of their thoughts the Greeks
                    would also point out on their own, that the system in Greece was essentially so
                    corrupt and so bad that even very good people couldn't succeed there. Those same
                    people when they immigrated, whether it was to America or Australia or Britain,
                    did succeed. They got ahead. They prospered. And their conclusion was almost
                    universally, well there's something wrong with the system in Greece. That was I
                    think the starting point. My concern, knowing he was Greek-American, was that he
                    would suffer from localitis and he would be too apologetic for what I already
                    knew were some of the foibles of the Greeks. Not at all. He was tough as nails
                    on the Greeks when the time came, but he also knew how to schmooze with them and
                    get things done. He was very tough on his staff and drove himself and Estelle as
                    hard as he drove anybody else. He was not easy to work for, but I think he knew
                    how to get things done. For example, the DECA (Defense and Economic Cooperation
                    Agreement) agreement was up for approval in the GreekParliament.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Defense and Economic Cooperation Agreement related to
                        the U.S. facilities in Greece.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Exactly, that was it. And in this period, this was the late 1980s, the
                    Papandreou government was running out of steam with scandals and so forth. But
                    the national elections they'd held had not produced a clear, decisive majority
                    in the parliament so the only way the parliament was going to approve the DECA
                    was going to require some arm twisting or some absences on the part of certain
                    deputies. I forget how it was done because it happened before I got there, but
                    Ambassador Sotirhos managed to persuade Papandreou to have some of his party's
                    deputies, the PASOK (Panhellenic Socialist Movement) party deputies, absent
                    themselves from that vote so that the New Democracy deputies would have enough
                    votes to approve the DECA, and I think that's what finally happened. But he
                    didn't achieve that easily or right away. It took a lot of sessions with
                    Papandreou who in the end went along with it, and the DECA was approved. When I
                    got there, Constantine Mitsotakis had become prime minister, again with a very
                    narrow majority that the Greek election log never did produce a clear winner,
                    although manipulated many times.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: New Democracy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Constantine Mitsotakis of New Democracy ran the government and that was
                    the party in power for most of the time that I was in Greece. Papandreou came
                    back in the elections of November 1993 and I left in the summer of 1994.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, against that background, how did Ambassador Sotirhos
                        use you as DCM? What was your role as you saw it, as he saw it, and how did
                        things work within the mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The first thing he did was literally the first month I was there he
                    took me around to meet the president, Karamanlis, the prime minister,
                    Mitsotakis, the foreign minister, Samaras. Virtually the whole cabinet. He was
                    at those meetings. He took me in. It was a business meeting first of all, so we
                    transacted some business and then he would introduce me in the course of the
                    meeting and say, “This is my deputy who will be in charge of the embassy when I
                    am away on leave.” And basically the message was he's alright, work with him. So
                    I had recognition and I knew the people. I met them when he finally did go on
                    leave and I was the charg� and had to do some business with them. It was a very
                    useful thing to do, and I was a little surprised he did it so early because
                    there was a lot I needed to do in terms of learning how the embassy worked and
                    so on, and he wasn't planning on going on leave soon. In the end he didn't leave
                    until January when Desert Storm broke out and I had to call... no, he was there.
                    But for some reason I had to call up the Prime Minister, Mitsotakis, at 10
                    o'clock one night to ask for urgent clearance to let our transport aircraft fly
                    through Greek airspace on the way to reinforce our effort in Kuwait. I had met
                    the prime minister, by this time several times in his office and elsewhere, and
                    I got right through, the embassy operator got me to the prime minister's
                    operator and zoom it went right through, and I found myself discussing in Greek
                    with the prime minister. Military operations for which I didn't have the right
                    vocabulary, but I did remember the word for logistical support and got that out.
                    And the prime minister agreed very quickly. It was a short conversation, but it
                    was facilitated by the fact that Sotirhos had laid the groundwork and made me
                    acceptable, let's say, in his august circles. He was very good at that, and I
                    met the military leadership as well through our MAAG (military assistance
                    advisory group) chief who was a two star air force general, as well as through
                    Ambassador Sotirhos early on. The Greek military. The chiefs of staff, the four
                    stars.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he see your role within the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Well, he wanted me to be the manager of things. He said he did. And in
                    many respects I was the manager. But because of his knowledge of things, the
                    fact that he'd already been there about a year when I got there, he was
                    obviously in direct contact with a lot of people. If he was very interested in
                    an issue it would be directly taken care of. One example, he was a businessman
                    as I said, and a New Yorker, and perhaps for both reasons he had a good nose for
                    corruption. And basically he was able to look at certain of our senior locals
                    who had positions in procurement, warehousing, other areas, and surmise that
                    they needed more careful review because they were dressed too well, their
                    watches were too expensive. The apartment they lived in was in too upper bracket
                    a section of Athens, something was going on. And I have to say, my initial
                    reaction was he was being paranoid because I don't think of people that way. But
                    when we looked at some of these folks, sure enough the procurement lady it
                    turned out had been fleecing us for several hundred thousand dollars a year by
                    various transactions with vendors. The books always balanced. You couldn't look
                    at the books and find it. The enrichment came off the books. But we had a
                    special investigation done. He was right. We fired her. We wanted to not pay her
                    severance benefit as we were technically required to under Greek law because she
                    was a senior FSN, but Washington did not want to back us up on that if it came
                    to a court case. In the end we had to pay her severance.</p>
                <p>He was very much involved with the personnel, especially the Greek personnel of
                    the embassy. Very suspicious of some of them, and as I said, in some cases, not
                    just this one, his suspicions were well-founded. I think though, because it was
                    essentially a suspicious approach and not what the Greeks had expected
                    certainly, FSNs, it led to more tension than was necessary. Athens was not a
                    happy post in his time, I don't think. Largely because of his approach to work
                    and drive and when he gets under pressure like many of us, he gets rather terse
                    with people, he can be brutal with people sometimes. Both Americans and FSNs as
                    well as Greek officials. He could chew out a Greek minister as well as a
                    political counselor with equal effect. So it was not a happy place. One of the
                    issues that was our first delicate issue to deal with. Ann had to deal with this
                    really, because Estelle, Mrs. Sotirhos, and the ambassador took it very
                    seriously. Apparently a lot of our staff did not know which fork to use, I know
                    that sounds absurd, but the Sotirhos's believe that you should use the correct
                    fork and apparently they were used to meals where they had lots of utensils on
                    either side of the plate. This happened before we got there, but we were told
                    that a number of our senior Americans had inelegantly used the wrong utensil at
                    a meal at the residence in the presence of the ambassador. Mrs. Sotirhos had
                    noticed it and wasn't this a horrible thing and this had to be fixed, by God.
                    Not today but yesterday. So Ann was given the mission of fixing it. We'd never
                    seen this behavior. The American staff looked fine to us, in fact they'd eaten
                    at our table and they seemed to know how to be. They didn't use their hands or
                    anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You probably didn't offer them quite as many utensils as
                        at the residence.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Not as many perhaps, but they seemed like normal people, so it was a
                    very delicate thing. I forget how Ann did it, because it was done in the
                    presence of Mrs. Sotirhos and the ladies essentially. The ladies were given this
                    message to take back to their husbands and I was not involved, but Ann worked it
                    out with her diplomatic skills so that it became sort of a game. Ann made it
                    enjoyable, they reviewed things, they had even a film as I recall on etiquette,
                    and they went through it utensil by utensil by utensil, what it's for. And
                    without telling the American ladies you dolts, you don't know which one this is
                    that's why we're making you go through this, which is I think the way the
                    Sotirhos' preferred to do it, Ann did it in a lighter, more educational way, and
                    she only had to do it once, fortunately. But I mention this because as I say I
                    never saw it and I was flabbergasted that the ambassador and his wife would put
                    so much stock on that. So I said it must be the case that whenever anybody is at
                    their table he or she eats impeccably. I'm not exaggerating. About a week later
                    General Galvin or somebody like that, ranked four stars, came to the residence
                    for a working breakfast and the ambassador was on my left, General Galvin was
                    across the table for me. I was there and I think Laurel Shea the political
                    military counselor was there. There were four of us at breakfast being served a
                    representational breakfast at the residence. General Galvin, who also did not
                    eat with his hands, was given a piece of toast or croissant, took it, buttered
                    it with the butter knife, not his own knife, and then put it instead of on the
                    bread plate, on the main plate. I was waiting for the ambassador to explode, but
                    nothing happened. My lesson from that was, perhaps etiquette isn't the be all
                    and end all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like the ambassador was very hands on, I think
                        we can say.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Very much so. But if he thought you were doing the right thing, or if
                    he had confidence in you or didn't think the issue warranted his involvement, he
                    gave you pretty broad rein. The economic counselor, political counselor, he
                    rarely corrected their stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he want to see every outgoing telegram?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, he didn't. As I recall at the beginning he did and then gradually I
                    started signing off on things and even when he saw it he would rarely change
                    anything. So as his confidence grew in me, I think I took over more of that. He
                    thought that I was too soft on people, that is not hard enough on people, and I
                    certainly was nowhere near as hard as he was, and I think in a way his criticism
                    was a badge of honor, but it was a fair point. I was perhaps too understanding
                    of people and too gentle. He wanted me to be a lot rougher with some of them,
                    and my perception was that personalities aside, a lot of these folks had gone
                    through a rough period with him and there was no point in my grinding them down
                    further. He never liked that, but he didn't seem to hold it against me. Just
                    would remind me from time to time I had to be tougher.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok, well we've talked briefly about etiquette and about
                        Desert Storm in January of 1991 and the planes coming through. What were
                        some of the other issues and problems that you had to deal with in your time
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Well the constant one was November 17, the Greek terrorist group that
                    had been so successful in assassinating American and Greek officials since 1975.
                    Its first victim as you remember was Richard Welch, the CIA station chief in
                    Athens. And they killed a couple of Naval captains, defense attach� was one, a
                    Naval captain at the MAAG was another. They'd killed Greek officials including
                    the son-in-law of Prime Minister Mitsotakis, Pavlos Bakoyannis, and they'd tried
                    to kill quite a few others. We had our guard up all the time. I had to go in an
                    armored car. I had a follow car; the ambassador had an armored car and a lead
                    car, as did the MAAG chief and the defense attach� and so forth. It was not just
                    the ambassador and DCM, but the more senior officials really had to be protected
                    because we perceived that we were targets of November 17. Unfortunately, it has
                    to be said that November 17 was more professional and more successful than the
                    Greek police who were, at least on paper, supposed to catch them. They made few
                    mistakes. The Greek police made many. The bad guys were very dedicated to their
                    work; the Greek police seemed to care less sometimes. And to a large extent this
                    is not the fault of any particular Greek policeman but a fault of the system
                    which changed cops routinely whenever the minister changed. Not just when the
                    government changed, the prime minister changed. Whenever the minister of public
                    order changed all the senior cops would be rotated out. We learned the hard way
                    that many people whom we had trained in say counter-terrorism or forensics or
                    whatever, with a view toward catching November 17 and putting them out of
                    business. They were lined up doing traffic on roads or something when the
                    minister changed because they had not been permanently part of the structure. We
                    tried to fix that, this goes back before my time and continued after I left. I
                    don't think we ever really did fix that problem. The British and we put in a lot
                    of effort to help them. As the Olympics approached they got a lot of other
                    effort and support from NATO, from others. But they only caught November 17 and
                    rolled it up because November 17 got unlucky. It was a highly compartmentalized
                    group, fairly small. One of its people carrying a parcel bomb down near Piraeus
                    one day had the thing go off and injure him so badly he was taken to a hospital.
                    Once they had found him in that condition, figured out who he was, they were
                    able to unravel the whole gang and catch most of them fairly quickly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But that was long after you had left.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Long after I had left. And it only happened because of that accident.
                    Who knows how long it would have gone on if it hadn't. So it was always a
                    mystery why in such a chatty society as Greece where gossip is the currency of
                    the day and highly valued and used as the lead of an exchange, how a secret like
                    that could be kept so successfully. The membership of November 17 and nobody
                    would come forward. There were lots of suspicions voiced, and the CIA bought
                    lots of information and leads, but as far as I know none of them panned out.
                    People were in many respects afraid. November 17 had acquired Robin Hood type
                    mythos, legend. All powerful, all successful, impossible to penetrate. It was
                    never penetrated, and we never captured a member or put one away until this
                    incident happened by accident many years later. But part of it was in addition
                    to the way the police were politicized and rendered ineffective by this constant
                    transfer and shifting of personnel and cadres. The system was defective in other
                    ways. For example, judges were afraid to preside over trials. Prosecutors were
                    afraid to prosecute certain people believed to be members of November 17 or
                    close to it, because of fear of retribution. There were threats voiced, the
                    names and the addresses of the family members including the wives and children
                    would be published in left wing rags of various kinds whenever some trial was
                    coming up. And that had a very definite intimidating effect on the judiciary,
                    prosecutors, and others. Generally it was believed that November 17 had grown
                    out of a left wing violent offshoot of the group that had opposed the 1967 junta
                    from exile. I think that's correct, though I'm not sure that all the people who
                    were finally caught and put away were of that vintage, but it was believed
                    correctly to be a very small organization, often used the same pistol to kill
                    people. The same ballistics would turn up again and again, and sometimes it
                    would bring in hit men from overseas to assassinate folks. The Turkish embassy
                    press attach� was killed the last month I was there that way. So it was really a
                    bad thing, and particularly frustrating that for all the manpower and resources
                    we invested and the Greeks invested to catch these people and put them out of
                    operation, we had no success. None. It's particularly puzzling in that the Greek
                    counter narcotics effort was much more successful. Again, same police force,
                    different unit, but it's the same ministry, the same hierarchy. For some reason
                    their antinarcotics unit maintained cohesion and had a much higher level of
                    effectiveness. With some glitches, but a much higher level than the
                    counterterrorism group ever approached when I was there. So that's a real
                    mystery. But that was a problem and it was an issue that I had to deal with
                    because of the visibility of the ambassador and me and others. One of the things
                    I quickly discovered when I started presiding over watch committee meetings and
                    country team meetings was that in looking around the parking lot, every other
                    agency drove around in an armored, foreign cars. Now in Athens, European cars
                    were quite common in those days. Big Cadillacs and Plymouths were not, which is
                    what the ambassador and I had. So in other words, being driven around in a
                    Cadillac with or without a flag on it was almost like putting a bull's-eye on
                    the car, and my Plymouth had no other counterpart either. We had two Plymouths,
                    both lightly armored, and those were the only such cars in Athens. So the MAAG
                    chief had a BMW, the station chief had a Mercedes, lots of those, and on and on
                    and on. But they blended in, whereas the ambassador and I stuck out. So we held
                    a series of watch committee meetings and reported back to Washington what we had
                    found. Again, this is a high terrorist threat post. Despite the Buy American
                    Act, it really makes no sense to have the top American state officials in this
                    post drive around in the uniquely American cars, when all the other American
                    personnel are driving around in cars that blend in and fit much better in the
                    landscape, and are easier to maintain, because there were parts, the mechanics
                    knew this stuff. And essentially we embarrassed DS, Diplomatic Security, in the
                    department into waiving the rules and authorizing the purchase of some European
                    cars. The ambassador got an armored Mercedes finally, and I forget what I got,
                    what the DCM got. I wasn't looking for Mercedes, I just wanted something that
                    was a little less visible. Because of November 17 and the high terrorist threat
                    we got it, and it was a long haul. Our RSO did a lot of good work in that and I
                    think we got some bureaucratic support from other agencies back in Washington
                    since this was a no cost thing for them, it wouldn't come out of their hide to
                    have state use some of its limited money to buy a foreign car.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To what extent at that time that you were in Athens in the
                        early 1990s did we think that November 17 was part of a broader
                        international network or had ties abroad, and to what extent were you also
                        concerned in addition to November 17 by Arab or other non-Greek terrorist
                        groups that might operate in Greece?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Well there was at least one other Greek terrorist group, Revolutionary
                    Cells I think it was called, which had been known to set off bombs at various
                    places. There was one in Patras that went off the first year or two I was there.
                    But they were kind of feckless, they didn't kill people with the ruthless
                    efficiency and zeal of November 17, at least they didn't at that time. There
                    were lots of Palestinians crawling around Athens at that time, and the Greek
                    services were on top of them as we were through liaison and through direct
                    means, and just down the street from my residence, two doors down the street,
                    was the headquarters of the PLO (Palestinian Liberation Organization) where a
                    lot of these characters came from time to time. It was never a problem for our
                    residence. We just thought it was kind of amusing that the PLO was our neighbor.
                    So we were to a much lesser degree concerned by the Revolutionary Cells and by
                    the Palestinian groups. We were aware that they were there, but N17 was really
                    the focus. Every year, as you know, on November 17 there is a march to the
                    American embassy protesting the role of the U.S. government in the era of the
                    1967-74 junta and holding us responsible largely for what the junta had done to
                    the people of Greece and the students of Greece on November 17, 1973. And this
                    march, which starts at the university and comes up Queen Sophia to the embassy,
                    usually attracts a large number of hangers on, including Palestinian groups,
                    Kurdish groups, other groups. University students for sure, but some of these
                    people got violent, stone throwing, that sort of stuff, even scuffling. The
                    embassy was always protected by a lot of police, there were always arrests made,
                    and they had tried to hold them back far enough so the rocks couldn't do any
                    damage. You always had to be a little careful with that because you didn't know
                    what was going to attach itself to the march, and that would be another cause
                    for concern. November 17 never hid itself in large groups like that. As far as
                    liaison with other terrorist groups who were part of an international movement,
                    we never thought N17 was part of a broader international movement. We thought a
                    large part of its success was due to the fact that it was not, that it was so
                    sealed off, almost hermetically, from any source including foreign ones. There
                    was some kind of cooperation we thought, some of the non-N17 hit men were
                    employed to come in and do a job, just shoot the Turk or shoot the American and
                    then get out of the country. How they were paid, how they were hired, we never
                    figured out, but the surmise was that the active cadre was probably not in the
                    inner circle. That's all that I recall about N17.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, what other issues were you particularly concerned
                        about in this period. U.S. military issues, Turkey?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Turkey was always on the plate. The bases were working pretty well
                    although they were phasing out as they were throughout Europe. We had an army
                    base up in the northern part of Greece that phased out. The large air force base
                    near Athens, Hellenikon, phased out the first year we were there, and then the
                    last year we were there the intelligence base on Crete at Heraklion phased out.
                    So coordinating that, discussing that with our own authorities in the European
                    commands in Washington and negotiating the circumstances with the Greek
                    authorities was a big part of what we did in those years. We had two large
                    communication relay sites outside of Athens which handled a lot of the message
                    traffic for State and other agencies. We wanted to close them out or upgrade
                    them. I forget what it was. Consolidate them. There were issues there that had
                    gone on for years that we kept talking with the Greeks about. I think we finally
                    shut one, scrapped the material, got agreement to do that, and then relocated to
                    the other site.</p>
                <p>A big issue that we had that is still I think a hardy perennial on the agenda of
                    whoever is running embassy Athens was our effort to purchase the land behind the
                    embassy. The parking lot. Originally that had been just a parking lot and there
                    was a street between it and the chancery and that street was closed years ago
                    for security reasons and gradually the embassy operation spilled over to put
                    structures on the parking lot. Even though we didn't own the land we put up
                    warehouses, other structures, and surrounded the whole thing with a security
                    fence. But we really wanted to own the property outright to avoid the political
                    arrows and other arrows we took from time to time from the owners of that land
                    who thought that the rent we were paying was not enough. We almost got it. One
                    year Sotirhos wanted to get this done because he'd gotten the DECA done, he'd
                    gotten a tourism agreement done for the first time with Greece. He'd gotten a
                    civil aviation agreement done by putting his laser-like focus on the issue and
                    driving the American embassy folk to the point of distraction sometimes. But he
                    got it done. And this was one he wanted to get done too. And he was right. He
                    almost got it done. The problem was by the time he hammered the Greek officers'
                    pension fund leadership into line, they were the ones who owned it, and got the
                    foreign ministry to push them in line and to back this, the money that had been
                    fenced off by FBO (Foreign Buildings Office) for purchasing the land, 12 million
                    dollars, was no longer available. By the time he tried to get that money put
                    back together again then the pension fund was at odds. We just never could line
                    up all the stars together; it was that sort of thing. But our use of the
                    property continued unabated. It was never challenged in any real way. There were
                    threats of legal action by one party or the other, but it was always a potential
                    vulnerability. We spent a lot of effort on that, discussing that with the
                    foreign ministry and with others, ultimately with no resolution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there for the U.S. elections in 1992. I assume
                        Ambassador Sotirhos was still there and probably was not very happy with the
                        results. Or did he go back to help with the campaign?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No. He was always a Republican, there was never any doubt about that,
                    and he had a number of his friends, colleagues from the party I think, come to
                    stay with him at the residence when he was there, but he was scrupulously
                    non-partisan as an ambassador. For example, he would host a reception for the
                    Republicans abroad in Greece and he would host a reception for the Democrats
                    abroad. He really took his job as ambassador in that sense in a truly
                    non-partisan sense which I thought was admirable. One of the things he did that
                    was striking was former President Carter came to Greece in '92 perhaps to
                    receive an award from the Onassis Foundation of $100,000 for the work of Habitat
                    for Humanity which he had founded. And so President and Mrs. Carter came and the
                    Sotirhos' gave a very lavish reception in their honor with the whole Greek
                    establishment. The ambassador basically escorted them around, introduced them to
                    everybody, made sure they had a good time, and spent a lot of time with them. I
                    knew he did not like Jimmy Carter's politics. We didn't talk politics often, but
                    I knew that given the way that Reagan had come in and I knew he'd been involved
                    in that campaign, I knew he had a very strong view. But he treated Carter with
                    tremendous respect and deference. This was a President of the United States and
                    by God he's going to be treated that way and honored by the Greeks as well as
                    the Americans here. So it was really a commendable effort and I think a good
                    time was had by all.</p>
                <p>He did not go back for the campaign of '92. I honestly don't know if he had any
                    involvement at all. He may have given advice, he may have not been asked. He and
                    Estelle did know the Bushes fairly well from the campaign of '88 and earlier in
                    the Reagan administration they were on a first name basis with them. He knew
                    everybody in the Bush White House. Whether he wanted to go back and do more I
                    really don't know, but the fact is he didn't. He stayed in Greece until late
                    January of '93. Just around Inauguration Day, I think a few days later, he and
                    Estelle left Greece for good and I started what became a 10 month period as
                    charg�.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ok. Why don't we stop there. Let me just ask you before we
                        finish this tape if there were any other prominent significant visitors that
                        really stuck out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: President Bush came there just after the Gulf War, so probably late
                    spring/summer. He made a swing through the area. Went to Turkey, went to Greece.
                    Went to other places. But it was the first time in many, many years that a
                    sitting American president had come to Greece. I think the last time had been
                    Eisenhower in 1959. A sitting American president. And it was a great success.
                    Cyprus was a big part of that. We made a real effort to make some progress on
                    Cyprus with the Turks, with the Cypriots, with the Greeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he go to Cyprus, Bush?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: He did not go to Cyprus, no. But there was a tremendous lead after
                    that. Security was a major concern obviously because N17 was still around and
                    Labor of Love. I think they had issued a proclamation. They issued proclamations
                    from time to time which always made it into the press but could never be traced
                    to anybody, about the imperialists and this and that, inveigh against Bush. We
                    took tremendous security precautions and there was no incident at all during his
                    visit. He went to the Greek parliament and spoke. There was a reception in his
                    honor at the residence which was a security nightmare because there were
                    high-rise apartment buildings all around the gardens of the residence. The Greek
                    police literally had to shut down every apartment that faced the residence and
                    make sure the balconies were clear before the President would go out onto the
                    lawn. It was a good visit I think in every respect, but the progress we were
                    going to make, or thought we had in the bag, had lined up for Cyprus, did not
                    materialize, because at the end of the day Mitsotakis and the then Turkish prime
                    minister were supposed to sit down and agree on something. I forget who the
                    Turkish prime minister was. And this had all been laid out we thought, and
                    choreographed, and the Turkish prime minister basically said I have no idea what
                    you're talking about when Mitsotakis raised the subject and so it came to
                    naught. They met one on one and I asked Lucas Silas who was later ambassador to
                    Washington who was then Mitsotakis' chief of staff what language they had spoken
                    in. It was German. And I said was it possible that they didn't understand the
                    term that was used. And Lucas did not speak German. He checked with Mitsotakis
                    who said no, Mitsotakis was absolutely fluent in German and he said that the
                    Turk was too. So, whatever it was, it appeared the Turk had backed out of
                    something that had just become too politically delicate for him to manage at
                    home. And that chapter, what happened between Mitsotakis and the Turk, happened
                    before I became charg�.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're just beginning to resume on the 3rd of February 2005
                        talking about James Williams' period as DCM in Athens from 1990 to 1994.
                        And, why don't we begin, if your memory is coming back, to whatever your
                        involvement with - Mitsotakis was Prime Minister of Greece? And the prime
                        minister of Turkey and something about Cyprus, and I don't know exactly when
                        that would have been.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: This was the aftermath of the visit by President Bush to the region
                    after the Gulf War. Bush came out to Ankara and Athens in I think July, or
                    summer of 1991 in the wake of the coalition's great victory of the Gulf War. And
                    for months before that trip there was a tremendous emphasis in the department
                    and in the field to try to rack up some achievements in connection with that
                    visit, and one of those achievements was going to be Cyprus. There was a lot of
                    effort expended on what could be done to promote Greek/Turkish support for
                    progress on Cyprus, and indeed progress on the other issues that divided Greece
                    and Turkey. We went through the whole inventory of those issues that affected
                    those two countries bilaterally. Cyprus was one of the biggest but certainly not
                    the only one that irritated the relationship. And the Bush visits to both
                    capitals went very well. Good conversations, professed understanding and
                    agreement by Mitsotakis in Athens and by his Turkish counterpart whose name I'm
                    forgetting now in Ankara to make some meaningful steps on Cyprus. In the wake of
                    Bush's visit and the positive signals that all sides recorded on the subject of
                    Cyprus, the next step was supposed to be to hammer out an agreement in the
                    direct meeting between Mitsotakis and the Turk. I forget where that meeting
                    occurred. It was not in Greece. It was somewhere in Europe. In any case, it was
                    a complete fiasco. The Turk, according to accounts we got from both delegations,
                    the Turk professed no knowledge of any agreement or understanding with Bush or
                    anybody else to make a deal with Mitsotakis � propos Cyprus. We went through
                    this any number of ways. They spoke in German by the way which was interesting,
                    because Mitsotakis is multilingual as most Greeks of his generation are. The
                    Turk also had studied in Germany so their best common language was German. We
                    even explored, since I speak German, whether there was a possibility of a
                    misunderstanding of the German term that was used, but there was no chance of
                    that because they were quite literally fluent in the language. They knew what
                    they were saying or what they were not saying. So for whatever reasons the
                    Turkish government through its prime minister walked away from that tentative
                    understanding that President Bush had catalyzed. There was tremendous
                    disappointment in Athens by Mitsotakis and his team that they'd been let down or
                    bamboozled or whatever. I don't think they blamed us directly for it, although
                    we had certainly been involved in the birth of this understanding, but they were
                    very, very disappointed that it did not occur.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, then I believe you wanted to talk some and we
                        certainly ought to cover the period that you served as charg� d'affaires.
                        This must have been at the beginning of the Clinton administration in early
                        '93 for something like 10 months?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: That's correct. Michael Sotirhos, my ambassador, who was a Republican
                    par excellence made very clear that if President Bush lost the election in
                    November that he would be leaving Athens fairly soon thereafter. And indeed the
                    Sotirhos' packed up and left Athens at the end of January 1993, just a few days
                    after the inauguration of President Clinton. So I entered a period of charg�ship
                    which I had done before. I'd been charg� at various times when Ambassador
                    Sotirhos was away on leave, medical, personal or otherwise, and it was nothing
                    new. This time, however, I knew it would probably be a bit longer since the in
                    nature of things it takes Washington a while to gear up a new administration and
                    to make appointments. It turned out to be almost 10 months. I think Tom Niles
                    came the end of October of 1993. There had been rumors in the early months of
                    the Clinton administration of other names that were being traded back and forth
                    and that was probably the case. In any case, around May or June I think the
                    nomination of Tom Niles went forward and then it was a matter of going through
                    confirmation and so on so he could come out by October.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He had most recently been assistant secretary for European
                        affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Indeed he had, and had impressed newly installed President Clinton very
                    much with his savvy and his command of the brief on the occasion of visits by
                    European dignitaries to the White House. So I'm sure Tom had hoped to get
                    something bigger coming out of the EUR job, but he got Athens and it took him a
                    while to get out. I was happy to be charg� as long as I could. Looking back on
                    it the charg�ship for me was probably one of the highlights of my whole career
                    in the Foreign Service because it was so long and so much fun. The only thing I
                    would have done differently is I wish I had been told from the beginning exactly
                    how much time I had, because if you know how much time you have, even if it's
                    two months or two weeks you can allot your energy a little differently than if
                    you really don't know. For a long time until the nomination of Niles was firm,
                    and even after that for a while, we really didn't know when he would arrive and
                    therefore I didn't know how long I would be charg�. It was a matter of more than
                    just housekeeping in the interim. There were things to be done with regard to
                    the management of the mission. There was a major project to rehab the residence
                    before the ambassador got there. This was a project which you may recall from
                    your time in EUR/SE had been pending for many, many years and no ambassador
                    wanted to go through having his residence torn up while he was there. So every
                    ambassador, including Ambassador Sotirhos, postponed that project under one
                    pretext or another. But when Sotirhos left we decided to bite the bullet and use
                    the gap, we knew there would be a gap, to launch the project. And naturally, as
                    with every project of this kind, particularly in Greece, there are delays, there
                    are overruns; the architectural plans had to be revised again because the FBO
                    had second thoughts about something that it had approved about eight years
                    before. Same plan, but it had to be revisited, so that cost us time. Some of the
                    vendors let us down with their delivery schedules and there was Murphy's Law at
                    work as always with construction. So the bottom line was when Ambassador Niles
                    arrived in late October his residence was not fully completed. We came close,
                    but it wasn't done, and of course because the work had been done in haste a
                    number of defects emerged that had to be corrected. This took a lot of time, it
                    wasn't the main thing we did, but it was a big part of our activity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think if you had realized that you were going to be in
                        charge of the embassy for 10 months then you probably would have approached
                        the entire period differently than not knowing really how long it was going
                        to be.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Probably would have. One thing I did do and I felt very strongly about
                    this because I had been braced on the subject when I came to Athens as DCM. I
                    opened up the residence swimming pool to the entire American community,
                    government including military. This had been a very sore subject because the
                    Sotirhos' when they came jealously guarded their privacy and rescinded the
                    community hours that had been around for many, many years under many of their
                    predecessors for a long, long while. And that rescinding of the use of the pool
                    was bitterly resented by an awful lot of folks in the embassy at the time. Most
                    of them had left by the time the Sotirhos' were gone, so I figured it would be
                    the right thing to open up the residence pool to everybody, including myself. I
                    went over for lunch swims quite regularly the summer of '93 in the fall. In my
                    experience it was never very crowded. There were usually some families there,
                    young children, teenagers, whatever, but it was a real plus particularly given
                    the overall security situation in Athens. The fact there were no local pools
                    that were easily available for our people, the fact that the nearby beaches were
                    highly polluted and the clean beaches were a fair drive away, so this seemed to
                    be a good thing to do for embassy morale generally. And since nobody was using
                    the pool it didn't make any sense to leave it there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tennis court also?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Tennis court too, although that was never... I guess under Sotirhos too
                    that was off limits but the swimming pool sticks in my mind as something people
                    really wanted more and they were happy to get. The tennis courts, I forget how
                    we worked it out; it was sort of first come first serve. To my knowledge there
                    was never any problem with either of them. The interesting thing was that when
                    the Niles' arrived the privilege was taken back again because they did not want
                    the community coming in to use the pool which was built of course with public
                    money on the understanding it would be available for members of the embassy
                    community, but that's another story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From their point of view it's a question of privacy and
                        intrusion on their space and so on, although I think a compromise could be
                        found where there would be access by both.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Limited hours, certain days when the community could use it. So I made
                    the right decision but it did not reap any gratitude when it was rescinded.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else about that period as charg�?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Well we had a lot of concerns for my whole time including my charg�ship
                    about November 17. We really never in my whole time in Athens got to the bottom
                    of that organization, what it was, who they were. We thought we had leads; the
                    CIA spent a godless amount of money and devoted endless man hours to profiling
                    these folks, to reading literature from people who might be sympathizers or even
                    directly involved. They had a very sophisticated analysis which I read at one
                    point trying to pin the rap on a particularly prominent leftist journalist and
                    novelist who was prolific. The one reason they were able to pin it on him in
                    their analysis at least was that he used certain terminology and certain plots
                    in his novels that very closely resembled some of the assassination scenarios or
                    attempted assassination scenarios by N17. Some of the language in their
                    proclamations. It read persuasively, but at the end of the day it was absolutely
                    wrong because none of the names in their analysis as I recall from when the case
                    was finally broken a few years ago turned out to be the true culprits. But we
                    spent a lot of time worrying about them because they were so good at what they
                    did and the police were so bad at trying to stop them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any November 17 attacks while you were
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes, during my whole time at Athens and before the base at Hellenikon
                    closed an air force master sergeant was blown away by a remotely detonated bomb
                    which November 17 had set and for which it claimed credit. They basically
                    planted this bomb in a shrub next to his house and monitored his comings and
                    goings. When he was coming back one day, regularly as he did with his laundry
                    under his arm, they detonated the bomb that they had planted there. It was very
                    sophisticated, very successful, and they never caught the folks. Then November
                    17 shot and killed a very prominent banker, Greek, while I was there. Similar MO
                    (modus operandi), not with a bomb with the same gun that had been used to kill
                    the station chief and quite a few others in past years, in '75 when Mr. Welch
                    was killed. A few weeks before I left they assassinated a junior press attach�
                    at the Turkish embassy. A year before that my Turkish counterpart, Deniz
                    Bulukbasi, was in a car with some other Turks going to work and they were bombed
                    by a remotely detonated device very similar to what had been used against he
                    sergeant. His legs were badly torn up. The Turks survived but they were very,
                    very badly off because of that. So it was a live, virile and ongoing threat of
                    which we were always aware and required me and quite a few others to go around
                    in armored cars with follow cars, Greek police, all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that requirement for protection for you change when
                        you were charg� or was it pretty much the same before and after?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: All that changed was the car. I think I mentioned in my last session
                    that we had been able to get a Mercedes after bludgeoning the department into
                    letting us bend the Buy America Act. The Cadillac the ambassador had been using
                    was unique in Greece and was like having a bull's-eye on his back. So when the
                    ambassador was not there and I was charg� I used the Mercedes. I think I had his
                    Greek team and the acting DCM had my car in my Greek team. That was all that
                    changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now when Ambassador Niles came at the end of October '93,
                        I wonder how that affected you and your responsibilities and what you did?
                        Sometimes when there's a long interim period and somebody is in charge for
                        as long as 10 months or whatever, it's a little awkward. Everybody thinks
                        that you're still there, you know everything, and it's a little difficult
                        for you and a little difficult for the new ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I think we went through our periods of awkwardness fairly well. It was
                    an adjustment I'll have to admit, to become the DCM again and to get used to
                    having an ambassador again. Once early after his arrival when we were going out
                    to call on the foreign minister or the president or whomever, we were going in
                    his Mercedes and I almost got in the door that he was supposed to get in, that
                    type of thing. I quickly corrected myself. Ambassador Niles was very different
                    than Ambassador Sotirhos. Much more informal in many ways and he made a point of
                    that in the first day. He specifically asked that people not stand in the room
                    or in the meeting when he came in the door. He did not want to have that sort of
                    protocol. In other ways too he was different. He didn't smoke a cigar so the top
                    floors of the chancery were not permeated with the Sotirhos whatever it was. And
                    other ways as well. Tom Niles is a consummate professional; he'd been ambassador
                    many times before and had had lots of responsibilities. There was really very
                    little in Athens that was new to him except that the language was not known to
                    him although he did make a good whack at learning it. He also really did not
                    need and perhaps even want a DCM in the sense that most ambassadors do,
                    certainly that Sotirhos did. He was so super confident and because he had with
                    him his longtime sidekick and �ber secretary Monty Montoya who was a superb
                    office manager. And she and Tom really were a formidable team. They introduced
                    some technological innovations which I thought were very good. They stopped for
                    example sending out invitations by car and driver that took forever. They faxed
                    them, which was totally new to me, and it worked in Athens. It got speedier
                    results and better results. I think Tom and I had a good relationship. It was
                    not as close as it was with Ambassador Sotirhos because Sotirhos had picked me,
                    and Tom knew I'd be leaving that summer and he'd already picked Tom Miller to
                    come out, so the transition was assured.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, anything else you want to say about your four years
                        in Greece as DCM which ended summer of '94?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Summer of '94 actually Tom Miller, my successor, and I had an overlap
                    of a few weeks. The Millers came for a vacation in Greece while we were still
                    there and lived in a temporary apartment. I used my farewell reception at our
                    residence to introduce Tom and Bonnie to my contacts and friends. So it was a
                    good transition from my point of view. I quickly sensed though as soon as Tom
                    started working that it was good for me to get out of Dodge because there's not
                    room in any embassy for two DCMs. Basically he became DCM when I was still
                    there. I was trying to do a few final efficiency reports and other things. But I
                    think it was a smooth transition. It was a great experience and I was eternally
                    grateful to Ambassador Sotirhos for bringing Ann and me to Athens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, when you left Athens you returned to Washington,
                        what assignment did you have there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Actually I had not done very well in lobbying for my next job. After
                    the great good fortune of having two phenomenal jobs in a row, the political
                    advisorship in Berlin and the DCMship in Athens, I foolishly assumed at least
                    subconsciously that another good job would fall into my lap as those had done.
                    And it didn't happen. The administration had changed, and that meant the whole
                    cadre of EUR was changing. I had opportunities. I turned down a chance to be a
                    candidate for DCM in Bern, perhaps foolishly. And I said at the time to the
                    ambassador who asked me, that I truthfully was planning to go back to Washington
                    unless something really, really special like DCM Bonn came up. That was the one
                    I tried to get with my perversely narrow focus on German affairs. I even managed
                    to find Dick Holbrooke by phone once. I think I called him in some place in
                    remote central Asia and we spoke for about 30 seconds and he rang off and said
                    he'd call back but we never did get in contact again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was ambassador to Germany at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I believe he was ambassador designate to Germany. That's when I started
                    badgering him to put my candidacy forward. It didn't work for various reasons.
                    So I came back basically on assignment to the board of examiners, prepared to
                    spend some time there and see what would happen. I had literally just spent
                    about five days at the board of examiners and got a call from the head of the
                    office of southern European affairs asking if I'd like to be a candidate for a
                    special coordinator for Cyprus, a job that Nelson Ledsky and others had held. I
                    knew a lot about that and I had never considered doing it, and therefore had not
                    lobbied for it. They had several candidates at the time, including my
                    predecessor in Athens Ed Cohen. Holbrooke by this time was just coming on board
                    as the assistant secretary for EUR and I said sure, that sounded like fun. So
                    within a very short time I was ushered over to meet with Holbrooke who spent
                    very little time talking to me, lectured me on what had happened with the law
                    that had created the job of special coordinator for Cyprus years before. He'd
                    been involved with that. I didn't realize that. And I got the job, and quickly
                    extricated myself from the board of examiners. So I got a job with a secretary,
                    a little office, fairly good sized travel budget and a lot of independence on a
                    subject that I knew very and well in which I thought I could make a
                    difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And with the rank of ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The rank of ambassador came later. I had to go through the senate
                    confirmation process for that. It took a long time to fill out all those forms
                    that had to be vetted by our people, then by the White House appointment staff,
                    you know that well. And I went up with five other nominees for ambassadorships.
                    I was the only one with just the title, and as I recall Senator Lugar was the
                    chairman of the hearing in his capacity as chair of the European subcommittee.
                    Very gracious man, very gracious man. The hearing was not well-attended. I think
                    Senator Sarbanes was there briefly, Senator Pell, Senator Lugar and maybe one or
                    two others, plus some staffers in the background. I'd never done that before. My
                    wife was there, a friend of the family was there, and Senator Lugar graciously
                    gave us each a chance to introduce our families and we did, stood up. Everybody
                    was very nice. The only difficult questions, or interesting questions, came from
                    Senator Pell who wanted to know in his semi-querulous way, why we needed all
                    these envoys for a problem involving a small island. It was actually a good
                    question. I danced around it, because by this point we had not only the
                    ambassador to Cyprus job that you had, we had the special coordinator for Cyprus
                    with ambassadorial title. We also had a new presidential envoy for Cyprus,
                    Richard Beattie, who had just been announced. So Pell wanted to know how these
                    folks were going to keep out of each other's way and I gave the answer as best I
                    could and nobody pursued it. I never read the transcripts; I don't recall
                    exactly what I said. There was no follow up question on it, but it was a very
                    pertinent question because that's a lot of manpower for one problem that was not
                    on the top of the administration's priority list at that time. Senator Pell gave
                    each of the five of us nominees a softball question or two and that was it. So
                    the senate gave its advice and consent some weeks later and then I got a form
                    letter from President Clinton with this wheeled signature saying “I herbie
                    appoint you” the rank of ambassador yadda yadda. I kept a copy of that but I had
                    to give the original back when I got a true copy with the correct spelling of
                    hereby. Sharon Bixby was a little embarrassed that that one had slipped through
                    her staff. I think when Dick Holbrooke approved me for the job he knew full well
                    he intended to have his friend Dick Beattie become presidential envoy and he
                    hoped himself, I think he did, to spend some considerable time on the Cyprus
                    problem. As it turned out, Holbrooke got sucked into the Yugoslav quagmire for a
                    long part of his time as assistant secretary and basically ran out of time
                    before he could do much with the Cyprus problem.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well let's see, I have three kinds of questions. I guess
                        the first is; did you feel like you made any difference? Were you able to do
                        much? And second, let me tell you what my three questions are and then you
                        can pick and choose if any you want to answer, second is how did you get
                        along with Richard Beattie at the White House, and the third is how about
                        working within EUR with Holbrooke and others? Could you do that as well?
                        Because you did not have a line position. You had that position, office of
                        southern European affairs reported up through a DAS and Assistant Secretary
                        Holbrooke. So those are my kinds of questions.</hi>

                <p>WILLIAMS: The bottom line is I did not distinguish myself as special coordinator
                    for Cyprus. In retrospect I could have done some things differently and probably
                    better, but I don't think it was a very productive two years of my career and I
                    was very disappointed with that. Let me answer some of your questions. Dick
                    Beattie was not really of the White House ever. He is the managing director of
                    Simpson, Thatcher and Bartlett up in New York, a Lexington Avenue law firm. His
                    specialty, curiously enough, is mergers and acquisitions, a not inappropriate
                    field when you're dealing with the Cyprus problem in all of its glory. Dick is a
                    first rate human being. I thought he was a White House denizen at first, not
                    knowing a thing about him except his CV that I'd gotten. He's a Pennsylvania law
                    school graduate, I think he went to Harvard, he's Ivy League. Football player,
                    he'd been a Marine pilot after college, before law school. Married well, stayed
                    in New York. Very sharp guy. He'd been Joe Califano's go-to man when Joe was the
                    secretary for HEW (United States Department of Health, Education and Welfare) I
                    guess in the Carter administration. He'd gotten a lot of Washington experience
                    at that time. He had subsequently taught at the Kennedy School for a couple of
                    years and then come back to Simpson, Thatcher, Bartlett. A globetrotting
                    traveler, a man who was not given to wasting his time and he was not
                    particularly impressed with the title of ambassador that he was given as the
                    envoy, or with the Cyprus problem. He, to my surprise, since I was expecting him
                    to jump right in and sort of crowd me out, he came in rather slowly. He remained
                    the managing director of the law firm, very busy. Not inclined to wasting his
                    time on something that was not going to be productive. He read the briefing
                    books, he absorbed the essence of it very quickly. I went out for an initial
                    trip to the region to meet everybody in Greece, Turkey and Cyprus in November.
                    Then in December he and I accompanied again by Joe Moranty who was the Cyprus
                    desk officer went out for his initial calls. I think he sensed from the
                    beginning, certainly after that December trip, that the stars were not lined up
                    right for any big deal or any type of closure and that was certainly correct in
                    my view. We had another session. We stayed in periodic contact. I would go up
                    for regular consultations with the UN folk and always stopped by and see Dick in
                    his office. Sometimes he'd come down to Washington, but not too often. We stayed
                    in touch by phone. I would fax and mail him stuff occasionally, have classified
                    material delivered to him by somebody at USUN and that would happen on a regular
                    basis as the material arrived. At some point in the first year, that would have
                    been '95, he set up a meeting. His firm has an office in London, I forget where
                    it is. But our efforts focused on getting the two sides, hopefully Denktash and
                    Clerides together for a meeting. So we spent a lot of time trying to set that
                    up. At the end of the day we got a meeting offshore in London between two of the
                    advisors, Ned Ertegun and I think it was the attorney general of Cyprus, I
                    forget his name. A very young, balding, dynamic man. But they knew each other,
                    much younger than Ned Ertegun the Greek Cypriot. And they came with a couple of
                    guys, all sworn to secrecy, and we got the meeting going in Dick's office. The
                    same day that it started, it went on for two or three days I think, the Greek
                    Cypriot, Turkish Cypriot press started showing up so the cat was out of the bag
                    so to speak. The meeting really produced nothing except a rehash of well-known
                    positions. A lot of history, especially about the Turkish Cypriots. I have to
                    say, the biggest difference was Ned Ertegun wanted to go through the history of
                    the Cyprus conflict going back to earlier than the 1950s, and the Greek Cypriot
                    side wanted to look ahead, bridge the chasm, try to put Cyprus back together
                    again. It was just a very clear mismatch of efforts, because I think this
                    meeting was preceded by separate meetings between Dick and each of the
                    principals, Ertegun and the Greek Cypriot principle in the Lansdowne Hotel,
                    private lunch to which nobody but Dick and the foreigner went.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in London?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I was in London. Joe and I were on the periphery. We were in the large
                    meetings because everybody had supporting staff there, but Dick wanted to meet
                    individually one on one with the principals beforehand. I think that was a good
                    idea. We never got much readout on it, but I suspect that's because not much
                    really happened. In any case, I hope this isn't coming across as critical of
                    Dick Beattie at all, because I think given his ongoing responsibilities to his
                    firm, and the realities on the ground, there was not a whole lot of progress to
                    be made by investing more of his time in the Cyprus problem. But the very fact
                    that there was a presidential emissary for Cyprus, or envoy, I forget which term
                    we used, did debase somewhat of course the coinage of the special coordinator
                    for Cyprus. Naturally the protagonists in the field, if they had to talk to an
                    American official about Cyprus, would rather talk to the presidential emissary
                    if he was available, or the ambassador. I don't think it was ever a real problem
                    for me. I worried it might be at first, but Dick did not approach it in a
                    territorial way at all. On the contrary, we tried to get him more involved
                    periodically, but he just did not sense the time was right, and again he was not
                    a man to waste his valuable time on things that weren't promising. He did manage
                    to continue while he was in Cyprus and Greece and Turkey with me, and while he
                    was in London talking to the Cypriots, to do business of his law firm. He had
                    telephone and fax email access for all I know, and was really working that
                    primary job all along and was able to do it. It was never a problem, but I
                    marvel that he could do both.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When prominent Greek Cypriots or Turkish Cypriots for that
                        matter, or other national interested in the Cyprus problem came to the
                        United States would they go and see him in New York?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Very few. Some did. I think a number tried to, but I don't think he was
                    generally available. Sometimes he was out of the country on business. He was in
                    China quite a bit in those days. Sometimes he just was too busy to be involved.
                    He would refer them to either USUN if they were in New York or back to us in
                    Washington. I have to say, I think if there was some substance that happened in
                    the few meetings he did have, he generally told us what it was. He didn't put
                    things down in writing normally. We sent him everything. Sometimes, for example,
                    when there was a meeting in New York where he did meet somebody, I would go
                    along to help as note taker, do the cable and clear it through with him of
                    course because it was his conversation, and then he would clear it with minimal
                    change and out it would go. But normally he did not do that. The one big meeting
                    he had in New York, I think it must have been the occasion of one of the general
                    assemblies; Clerides and Denktash were both in town. This may have been fall of
                    '95. Perhaps the fall of '96 although I don't think so. In any case, Clerides
                    and Denktash were in town and Beattie had them both to a restaurant for lunch. I
                    think it was the Four Seasons. And he marveled at their appetites for drink and
                    food. They ran up a hell of a tab. I think it was reimbursed by representation
                    eventually, and a good time was had by all. I told this story to David Hannig at
                    one point, and I think Sir David at that point was the British equivalent of
                    Dick Beattie. I told David Hannig that story and he had had a similar experience
                    it turned out with those two when he was the perm rep at the UN and invited them
                    to a fine lunch and they had the finest of hors d'oeuvres and entrees and
                    desserts and wines and coffees and cigars, and at the end of it all when they
                    were smoking their cigars and looking very happily at each other, David asked
                    them, “You guys get along so well, why can't we just solve this damn problem
                    right now once and for all?” According to the story, Clerides and Denktash
                    looked at each other and laughed and said, “David you know damn well that if we
                    did that nobody would pay any attention to us. Now feed us these good
                    meals.”</p>

                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: And I think that may have been slightly embellished in the telling and
                    retelling, but there is a certain element of truth in it, to be sure. I enjoyed
                    Dick Beattie. I enjoyed working with him. I spent a lot of time traveling to New
                    York, to Europe, to Cyprus, less to Greece and Turkey. Least to Turkey. I spent
                    a lot of time traveling to the EU presidency because the Cyprus problem and
                    Turkey too as you know were very much on the agenda of the EU and I wanted to
                    stay in touch. And gradually I think the respective EU presidential power for
                    six months acquired its own version of the special coordinator for Cyprus and
                    the presidential emissary for Cyprus. There was a counterpart senior diplomat in
                    Rome. In Luxembourg it was the foreign minister, and in other places. I think
                    the travel got to me. I did not travel well. Jet lag bothers me, I have insomnia
                    anyhow, and it just took a certain toll on my normally good disposition. I
                    didn't spend a lot of time coordinating with EUR or with SE. In retrospect that
                    was a mistake. I did work closely with the Cyprus desk officer, I obviously
                    cleared everything, but I never really felt I was part of SE or for that matter
                    part of EUR, so that may well be the way I approached the job. May just be the
                    nature of the institution. I don't say that critically of anybody but myself. I
                    did not make myself indispensable or even particularly useful to the seventh
                    floor. I sent reports and when I met with members of congress, met with the
                    Greek-American lobby and so forth. That was all transparent and above board, but
                    I never established relationship with P or with anybody on the staff of S that
                    would have been useful in terms of getting me more closely tied in there. So I
                    think that's one big reason why I was not included on the trip that Secretary
                    Albright made to Cyprus in 1996. I have to say that rankled, but in retrospect I
                    can understand it. They took Kerry Cavanaugh who at that point was the head of
                    the EUR/SE and that was probably all the expertise that they needed. But by not
                    taking me or whoever was SCC, that does further devalue the currency of it. I
                    don't think there were any real clearance problems between me and EUR/SE. I do
                    think it would be more useful to integrate the special coordinator position
                    fully with SE or with one of the DASes in EUR. That has been done in subsequent
                    years. I think they dual-headed various folks.</p>

                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: That makes a lot more sense than having some free radical out there
                    with a budget and minimal staff, but not much authority over anybody. The one
                    thing I did do that I think is in retrospect useful to some extent, by virtue of
                    my four years in Athens I had met virtually everybody in the Greek-American
                    lobby from Archbishop Iakovos on down. I knew them well. I think they had
                    generally speaking a favorable view of me, but some of them, including one of
                    the advisors to Iakovos considered me a trokophilos a Turkophile, for reasons
                    they could explain better than I can. I had served in Turkey and I did speak
                    Turkish and I did think well of Turkey, but not necessarily for that reason less
                    well of Greece or Greeks. But I did have that reputation to overcome. I remember
                    when I was nominated for the SCC job, soon after I got the job, I was visited by
                    Andy Manatos, one of the leaders of the Greek-American community and indeed one
                    of the prominent lobbying firm Manatos and Associates in DC. And it quickly
                    became apparent that Andy's basic mission was to ascertain if my experience in
                    Cyprus in July of '74 had damaged me in their eyes and the eyes of the
                    Greek-American lobby to serve as an impartial and fair SCC. And he trotted out
                    some transparently phony story that he had known Rodger Davies very well and was
                    distressed when Rodger was killed in the attack on the embassy in August of '74,
                    and basically got me to recite my experiences there which I did with some
                    emotion because it had been an extremely emotional, traumatic time for all of
                    us. And I guess I satisfied him with my account because I kept the job, nobody
                    tried to get me out of it. But I did try to stay in very close touch with the
                    folks in AHEPA, the Pan-Cyprian groups, the archbishop sometimes. Michael
                    Sotirhos, we were still close at that point. He was up in New York, very close
                    with the archbishop. And I met with the archbishop once or twice with Paulette
                    his longtime office manager. Stayed in touch with her just to keep him informed
                    of what I was doing as SCC. I addressed various meetings of Greek-Americans, and
                    one of my innovations was, I don't think any of my predecessors had done it, I'm
                    not sure it was particularly useful, but I enjoyed the effort. I met with the
                    British equivalent of AHEPA, whatever the united Hellenes of Great Britain and
                    Northern Ireland call themselves. Large group, very, very impressive folks, and
                    the Turkish Cypriot counterparts as well when I was in London. I have to say
                    those overtures which were handled through the American embassy and informed to
                    the foreign office made Whitehall a little bit nervous, because here was an
                    American diplomat coming in to possibly churn their domestic waters the way they
                    saw it. That was certainly not my intent, nor was it the result. Basically it
                    was several social functions. A dinner as I recall at which a number of the
                    leaders of that community recited their personal experiences and views, a sort
                    of cathartic session, and I did more listening than talking. What was I looking
                    for? Well I was looking for some ideas, some thoughts, some input that might
                    give me some new perspective, some new thoughts that might be useful in
                    approaching the Cyprus problem. I have to say I didn't find them but I did enjoy
                    the experience of meeting these folks and staying in touch with them for my
                    whole time as SCC.</p>

                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Richard Boucher. We stayed in very close touch; particularly on that
                    effort to get the meeting set up which we did, but it was an unproductive
                    meeting. The meeting in London.</p>

                <p>WILLIAMS: It seems to me he did. I'm almost certain Richard was there. But I

                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I don't think I tried particularly to do that. And I don't think Dick
                    did either. We had a number of periodic meetings with folks in the secretariat.
                    I don't recall any meeting with the secretary general himself in which I took
                    part. Dick may have met with him once.</p>

                    particular overture or initiative by him or his people on Cyprus beyond the
                    normal management of the Cyprus problem, the six monthly renewal of the UNFICYP
                    mandate. Periodic consultations. Had a few interactions with Ambassador Albright
                    up in New York.</p>

                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Mesut Yilmaz. Young, rather phlegmatic sourpuss, taciturn, multilingual
                    technocrat. Definitely a German speaker. And English. Dick Beattie and I met
                    with him once in Washington when he was visiting, and he spent about an hour
                    with us talking about the Cyprus problem. Gave very little. It was a very short
                    report that I had drafted through that conversation. But he was definitely the
                    one that met with Mitsotakis and who reneged on the deal that we all thought had
                    been worked out on the occasion of President Bush's visit to the region in the
                    summer of 1991. The other Turk that we met with and I don't think I mentioned
                    this in my earlier remarks; Dick Beattie and I were in Ankara at one point. I
                    think we only went there twice. And this was probably the first visit. Tansu
                    Ciller was the prime minister. And I had never met Mrs. Ciller before. I had
                    seen pictures of her and knew that she was vivacious looking, but in the meeting
                    she came across as a bit of a flirt. There was a meeting with several of her
                    advisors. Dick Beattie was there, I was there, Dick Barkley the American
                    ambassador was there. Mrs. Ciller had eyes only for Dick Beattie and she smiled
                    and batted her long eyelashes at him, and in the course of making several
                    substantive points which were unyielding and consistent with what we'd heard
                    from the Turks for many, many moons on the subject of Cyprus, I took notes for
                    that meeting. It was a long discussion; it was late at night at the prime
                    minister's residence near the ambassador's residence. And as I recall I finished
                    that cable which I had to write on yellow paper at the hotel at around three
                    A.M. and I had to leave at six A.M. to catch my plane back home. I think Dick
                    Beattie had another plane to catch to go somewhere else. So I think I took that
                    draft and put it in an envelope and shoved it under the door to Dick's hotel
                    room, and went on. And the draft was taken care of and the cable emerged from
                    Ankara in due course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think before I turned over the tape you were starting to
                        say something about some contact you had with Ambassador Madeleine Albright
                        when she was U.S. representative at the United Nations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes, Ambassador Albright took part in several large discussions on
                    Cyprus when I was the SCC. Some of those discussions involved members of the UN
                    secretariat, some were in-house. And she was on top of the brief. Richard
                    Boucher was there for some of those meetings. Essentially it was a review of
                    where we were and where we were going, but she had a good grounding in the
                    Cyprus problem which I think she drew on when she was Secretary of State and
                    later went to the island in that capacity.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To what extent did you have contact with the United

                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Always met him, I think it was Gus Feissel throughout my time there,
                    and he was one of my main contacts beyond Richard Boucher when I went to the
                    island. Gus was intimately involved in everything we did. Very well informed and
                    I think a very savvy diplomat. It was good working with him.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An American, now living in California. I'm in touch with
                        him through the Cyprus Archeology Institute.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: He's on the board I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He is, yes. I guess I would say that no matter what you or
                        Dick Beattie or anybody else could have or would have done in this
                        particular period probably not much would have happened. It was just not a
                        particularly propitious time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, it wasn't. I fault myself though for not working more closely with
                    EUR, particularly SE. I have to say working with Dick Holbrooke was not easy and
                    certainly not fun. He has a very difficult style. It does get results, and I am
                    grateful to him for giving me the chance to be SCC and get the ambassadorial
                    title, but it was one of the least pleasant professional relationships I've ever
                    had in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He kept an interest in Cyprus. I ran into him just about a
                        year ago as I recall in Washington, and we had a brief conversation about
                        Cyprus. I think he rightly recognized that the two leaders who were in New
                        York at the time to meet with the secretary general, there was a real
                        opportunity for a breakthrough and that in fact did lead to the agreement on
                        the procedure and the referendum, and I think it was an important moment,
                        and I remember him recognizing that. And I think the next day Cyprus was on
                        the front page of the New York Times or two days later when that
                        breakthrough was achieved.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Dick's instincts were superb I have to say. Early on when he became
                    assistant secretary he chaired a meeting, I think it was a Saturday morning
                    meeting. You may have been there. Of the Greek-American leadership and prior
                    SCCs and others involved, specifically to discuss ways forward in the Cyprus
                    problem. But he integrated the domestic political component of that with the
                    professional analytical component of it, making sure that the AHEPA crowd, the
                    representative of the archbishop, Andy Manatos and others, and I think even
                    members of congress or their staffs who were interested were invited to that
                    meeting held at the State Department. We even provided lunch, sandwiches. I'd
                    never seen anything like that. It was really quite a good idea just to keep
                    everybody in touch, but also to make sure you had a domestic constituency for
                    whatever you might try to do.</p>
                <p>The last time I saw Dick he had left government. I was still SCC. I guess it was
                    my last trip to London. We were both coming through the clearance line at
                    Heathrow. He got through quicker because he was more of an upgraded status than
                    I was. And we chatted briefly as we were walking to get our bags and he asked me
                    about the Cyprus problem. He was still very much on top of it, and I'm happy to
                    hear he still is because his support can be valuable.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been early fall of '96, and a dinner was
                        organized at Fort McNair in the officers' club. It was an interesting
                        evening of discussion about Cyprus. Dick Holbrooke was supposed to be there
                        because he was in effect the Dick Beattie of the time for a period. But he
                        didn't come, and it turned out later that the reason he didn't come was that
                        he was invited by President Clinton to spend an evening, I think at the
                        opening of the MCI arena, at a Wizards basketball game. And I think he
                        rightly realized that spending an evening with the president was probably
                        going to be more productive than hearing a lot of talk about details and
                        some negative comments about the prospects for Cyprus progress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>I wanted to ask you one very specific question. I know when and why the special
                    Cyprus coordinator position was first established. I think it was in 1981 by
                    Secretary Haig, but at what point did it get incorporated into legislation. Do
                    you remember that? It must have been not too long after.</p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I guess that's one of the reasons why it was retained
                        for so long. Maybe even up to the present. Why there always had to be
                        somebody filling that position.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I just don't know the answer to that. I was in SE as Turkey's desk
                    officer when Haig was secretary, when this position was created. Reggie
                    Bartholomew was the first incumbent. I remember talking to him a lot as he was
                    reading in on the job. Reggie for all his gifts had never spent much time, or
                    wasted much time as he might have put it, on the Cyprus problem. He came out
                    somewhat cross-eyed from reading some of those briefing papers about the
                    minutia.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things he decided, which I don't think was a
                        good decision, but I understood why he did it, and it partly reflected his
                        reading of the file, he decided not to visit Cyprus. And he never did come
                        in that capacity. I think he felt that if he did come, this was early in the
                        Reagan administration, a visit by the special Cyprus coordinator, newly
                        established, would be seen as a United States initiative, greater degree of
                        American interest than the administration felt was justified at the time. So
                        he never actually came. A couple years later I was still in Cyprus as
                        ambassador. He did come, but by then he was ambassador to Lebanon and he
                        came on a Sunday to meet with Don Rumsfeld and Tom Miller who were involved
                        in the Middle East as a special envoy, Rumsfeld was, and he invited
                        Bartholomew, Sam Lewis, ambassador to Israel, and Bob Paganelli, ambassador
                        to Syria to meet him and they had an all day session at our residence in
                        Cyprus. And at the end of the afternoon I said to Reg, this is your first
                        time in Cyprus, you at least have to see the green line and get some sense
                        of what you've been hearing about all these years. And he in effect said I
                        don't have time, I have a plane to catch. Anyway, anything else about your
                        time as special Cyprus coordinator?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: No, I got a lot of reading done when I was in that job, including the
                    four volume memoirs of Glafkos Clerides, an English translation. My Deposition
                    it's called. And it's not the full history of Clerides life, but it does cover
                    the early periods including when I was working on Cyprus and knew him, so it was
                    interesting in that respect and covers the period through the coup too.
                    Interesting in that respect more for history than anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He is quite a character, quite a personality. I'd be
                        interested in reading parts of that. Probably not all four volumes, but
                        small parts.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: People who lived through that period with him, Stella Subiodhi comes to
                    mind, or were intimately involved with that period, have told me that it's not
                    the full account. It's inaccurate by virtue of things it doesn't cover. What
                    memoir could be comprehensive I guess. So I'm sure there is another part of the
                    story that he didn't get into. I enjoy Clerides very much. I have to say, as a
                    persona though, I found Rauf Denktash the most fascinating character on the
                    Cyprus stage. Partly because of his historical sweep, he goes back to the
                    beginning when he wants to brief you on the Cyprus problem, but also because of
                    his personality. Clerides was starting to fade when I was SCC. Denktash was not.
                    He was physically infirm, I think he had a heart attack around that time, but
                    his mind was agile and quick and he was a good dinner companion, lots of fun.
                    Clerides was slowing down.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would agree, certainly, about Denktash. At the time I
                        was there, '81 to '84, Clerides was leader of the opposition party, and I
                        think widely seen as having kind of served his country, done his job, and
                        performed his duty. The question was who was going to take his place as
                        leader of the party. The idea that he would be elected president and serve
                        for I don't know how many years as the president of the republic and leader
                        of the Greek Cypriot community seemed very unlikely. I would go visit him at
                        his law office or at his home, or on his boat in Larnaca, and we had a very
                        good relationship and very friendly, but it wasn't so much... and he always
                        had very sensible, thoughtful, pragmatic ideas, and certainly criticism of
                        Kyprianou and all that he stood for, but the idea that he had a lot of
                        future ahead of him didn't seem very likely at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I think an even less likely idea certainly when I was in Cyprus and
                    perhaps when you were there too, was that Tassos Papadopoulos would be president

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I agree with that, and I didn't really have all that much
                        to do with him. The first time I went to Cyprus as the deputy director of
                        southern European affairs in 1976 I met with him. He was at the time the
                        negotiator for the Greek Cypriot community. It was certainly appropriate to
                        meet with him. My picture was on the Cyprus mail with him. But when I was
                        ambassador the three years I didn't have that much to do with him. He had a
                        one person political party, maybe two people in the parliament. He was
                        mainly making money. He was a very successful private lawyer and just wasn't
                        around that much socially or otherwise. I agree. I wouldn't have given
                        Clerides very high marks for future and certainly not Papadopoulos. Ok, well
                        where did you go after being specially coordinating Cyprus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It became fairly clear to me in summer of 1996 that I didn't want to
                    continue being the special coordinator. Holbrooke had voiced no objection to my
                    staying on for a third year. I guess Kornblum was coming aboard as assistant
                    secretary at that time. In any case, I had a third year lined up, but I just
                    decided that I'd had enough and it was time for me to do something else. So I
                    started looking around. Not wanting to go overseas. My mother was quite ill at
                    the time, and I think we just wanted to be at home in America for the duration
                    of our stay with the Foreign Service. So I looked around for domestic jobs and
                    went calling on the head of assignments who happened to be Kent Brown. I asked
                    Kent what he knew of that might be interesting for somebody of my background and
                    talents, and the first thing he said was well what about his own job?
                    Unbeknownst to me, Kent was in the process of retiring from the Foreign Service.
                    He took a job with R.J. Reynolds flogging cigarettes and cookies in Russia and
                    the Caucuses or something like that. In areas where he had served in the former
                    Soviet Union, and was in the process of leaving the CDA early.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't you say what CDA stands for.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Career Development and Assignments. It's the office in the bureau of
                    personnel as it was called at the time that handles all the assignments for
                    Foreign Service personnel. And Kent was the head of that office. Not my
                    counselor and not even the head of the senior officer division, but I went to
                    see him just because he was head of CDA and I was special coordinator for
                    Cyprus. And he very graciously received me and clearly had just begun to start
                    to think about who might do the job since he was leaving off cycle and early.
                    This would have been in September of '96 I think. I had never thought about it,
                    but I talked to Kent, I talked to a few people about the job and very quickly
                    decided this would be something fun and very different than anything I had ever
                    done before. I had stayed away from admin type things assiduously in my
                    politically centered career. Rather late in life I've come to appreciate the
                    strengths and the capabilities of the admin function, but never had I done
                    personnel before or even thought about it. And I frankly knew very little about
                    the way the personnel system works. So with all that said, I threw my hat in the
                    ring and was very quickly interviewed by the PDAS, principal deputy assistant
                    secretary for personnel, Jennifer Ward who recognized me from some encounter or
                    two we'd had in the past. It must have been pleasant because she I gather
                    blessed my candidacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She had had that position before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: That's right. And then I met with Tony Quainton, the Director General
                    for Personnel. I guess I called on him in his office. I had known Tony for over
                    30 years since he had been involved on the India desk and I was a very junior
                    officer in the bureau of near eastern affairs. We were not close, but we did
                    know each other. It was a pleasant discussion. Tony's main concern was that the
                    head of CDA traditionally had the ambassadorial title, had been an ambassador,
                    and I was happy to be able to assure him that I had the title even though I
                    never served abroad as ambassador, but I had run an embassy overseas for a long
                    period of time so I was the functional equivalent almost of being a real
                    ambassador overseas. That seemed to satisfy him. As I said this was off cycle,
                    there really was a dearth of candidates. I popped up on the screen just as
                    suddenly as Kent Brown's departure had come on the screen, and there being no
                    major reason not to bless that move, I think they were happy that I was
                    available. So I had one more trip to make as SCC. I was in Luxembourg I think,
                    doing something, and maybe Cyprus as well, but Luxembourg because it was holding
                    the presidency of the EU I believe at the time. Clay Constantinou who was our
                    ambassador to Luxembourg and very close to the Clinton administration was my
                    host there. So when I got the job I think Tony called me at Clay's residence
                    where I was staying to give me the good news, and I came back to Washington
                    sometime in October of '96. Late October I guess, I moved over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One question is, that's not an easy time to start that
                        job. I started it a few years before in January and I thought it was very
                        difficult then in the middle of the assignment cycle. I think October would
                        have been just about as bad, maybe even worse.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0175" n="Page0175"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I knew so little about personnel, I'm not being falsely modest here, I
                    really was ignorant about most of the ways personnel worked. I didn't really
                    appreciate how difficult a situation I was in. It was all compounded by the fact
                    which I also didn't appreciate until I'd been there for a while that the
                    reorganization of CDA had just been accomplished. It was downsized and regrouped
                    in ways that apparently had left a lot of bruised feelings. I can't say that it
                    was done badly by the people in charge at the time; I can only say that there
                    were some bruised feelings when I got there a few months later. There were civil
                    service bruised feelings in particular, some foreign service bruised feelings.
                    There was a civil service/foreign service divide within the staff of CDA. There
                    were some problems, and so I spent a lot of time initially figuring out what
                    these 80 people did, what the mission was of the various components, the junior
                    officer division, middle officer division, senior officer division, that was
                    fairly clear-cut. The new group that was truly an exotic blend was the
                    assignment support division which was the technicians who had heretofore was
                    grouped with their respected counselors in the junior level and midlevel
                    divisions. They worked together as regional pods I think. Then under the
                    reorganization they were taken out to work as a new unit under somebody who'd
                    never been a supervisor before. So there were a lot of management and
                    supervisory issues there that had to be addressed. And also we were going
                    through a technological revolution. We still had Wang computers at that time,
                    PER, the bureau was in the process of acquiring off the shelf technology from
                    PeopleSoft which was going to do everything including butter our bread and
                    change our shoes for us. It had all kinds of promises financially of being the
                    first generation of this technology. There were lots of glitches and lots of
                    things didn't work. In other words the promise was more than the actual
                    performance as is often the case. I also have to say that since I am almost a
                    technophobe if not a Luddite, I didn't fully understand this stuff. A lot of my
                    colleagues did. It was the younger officers and secretaries who picked up on the
                    potential capabilities a lot more than I did. I did understand it wasn't
                    working, and when the screams of outrage would happen when the machine crashed
                    or the database was suddenly unavailable and it all had to be done by hand in
                    the height of the assignment cycle, the panel cycle, it didn't take more than a
                    Luddite to know that something was really wrong and had to be worked out. So
                    there was a lot of discussion that I was involved in with the leadership of PER,
                    Jennifer, and with Pat Popovitch the head of the admin part of the bureau who
                    was supervising the bringing online of all this technology in PER. CDA was the
                    frontrunner for that because we were so large, so big, and we were the test
                    case. I think we passed the test but it was painful, particularly for those
                    counselors in the trenches who had to do databases by hand after being told they
                    could be done electronically and things like that happened. There was no bad
                    faith involved, this was assurances that were conveyed in good faith, but it
                    just wasn't done as well as it should have been. One of my first decisions which
                    almost blew Jennifer's head off was to ask for a voicemail for every member of
                    CDA. Voicemail privileges had been jealously rationed I should say, and the
                    result was a lot of secretaries and technicians wound up taking new longhand
                    messages on the phone from our clients overseas and elsewhere. There was a lot
                    of resentment about that. It was not efficient. Voicemail did cost something,
                    but my sense was after talking with every section one of the leitmotifs of
                    desire was can we get voicemail or whatever it was called at the time. So I said
                    that makes sense, so I asked for it. And she was amazed that I would be so bold
                    as to ask for it for everybody. I gather Kent had not. But she agreed and Pat
                    agreed and we got it. And I think it clearly was the right way to go because we
                    used voicemail heavily from then on. The concern of course was that our customer
                    service would suffer, that people would not clear their queues of messages, that
                    they would not answer the mail and so on and so on. And I have to say in some
                    cases that happened and whenever it did we would get on people to clear the
                    queues, technicians especially, and give good customer service. We always tried
                    to give good customer service. We were very well aware of the fact we were a
                    service provider to clients all over the world. The dedication that almost all
                    of our people brought, the secretaries, counselors, and the techs, particularly
                    the techs who had more of a proprietary interest since they were civil service
                    and long-term inhabitants of those positions, was extraordinarily high and
                    impressive to see. And that's one reason when the electronic databases failed
                    one weekend and another weekend. It happened at least twice, we had people who
                    were able and willing to go in and by hand go through these hundreds of bids and
                    names and collate it and give us the agendas that made it possible to make
                    assignments.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a good deputy? Or was that another
                        problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: That was one of the things that happened; they abolished the deputy.
                    Essentially CDA had been downsized as well as reorganized in a very rapid way
                    without being given; the promise was this IT gadgetry would offset the loss of
                    manpower. Ultimately it had that capability, but in the short term it did not.
                    So there was no deputy. My deputy was essentially Margaret Dean who was head of
                    the senior officer division and had served in CDA before. She knew the office
                    very well and really she whispered in my ear all kinds of useful things for the
                    first year I was there, simply because I was so green. I chaired the large panel
                    meeting on Thursday. I had chaired many meetings, that was not difficult, but
                    knowing what the issues were, and when I was about to be bamboozled by somebody
                    was difficult, and so Margaret was there as my whisperer of truth to keep me
                    from making too many foolish decisions. She was invaluable. She was my real
                    deputy de facto if not in name. I had an office assistant the first year who was
                    left over from the reorganization. That position disappeared when she left, and
                    I had very close relationships also with the heads of midlevel and junior level.
                    I spent a lot of time with Mary Oliver the head of the assignment support
                    division because she's the one who really needed it. She had the problem
                    children who were unhappy with the reorganization, resentful of her, rebellious
                    in many cases, and she really didn't know how to handle them because she'd had
                    no training before this job and no experience as a manager. I hadn't had much
                    experience with those cases either but I spent a lot of time with Mary and I
                    think with good result. She became a much better manager.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel overall about the open assignment system
                        and how it worked, looking back?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Never having done it before and being somewhat cynical by nature, I had
                    really not appreciated how much integrity there is to the process. I was very
                    impressed and I told everybody that. I presided over the panel meetings and the
                    head of the midlevel office Georgia DeBell and then John Ford presided over the
                    other panel. We only had two panel meetings a week during the assignment season
                    roughly from late November till the heavy season, till March or April as I
                    recall. We met every week, but the heavy season was late November to April as I
                    recall. Tremendous integrity. The panel discussion, sometimes adversarial, was
                    very controlled and balanced. There would be a proponent for an assignment of an
                    officer and if another bureau wanted that officer and had a chance to put a hold
                    and make its case, if there was opposition to the assignment for whatever
                    reason, whoever was opposing had the chance to make that case. Sometimes on the
                    absence of a security check if a special clearance was required. Sometimes the
                    other checks medical, others had not been gotten. We had a lot of people in the
                    room with a lot of expertise and even though the agendas in the busy season were
                    very long as you recall with maybe 200 items, I always felt that we gave each
                    one a really fair shake, and the discussions when you had to have shootout which
                    would be a formal debate and presentation and then a vote, were always very
                    fair, almost always very fair. In the one or two cases when other information
                    came to mind that belied that judgment, or when I thought that for whatever
                    reason the counselor had not done a good job we would do it again. I would just
                    void the decision as chairman and we would come back at it again de novo. But I
                    thought the effort to get the information out to the officers, particularly
                    those in the field, and that's why customer service was so important, to get the
                    bid list out in a timely way, to get the ancillary documents out that helped
                    make an informed decision in writing the bid list, that was so important. And
                    also timely responses by the counselor and the techs. These myriad questions
                    that come in from people. What about my cat? What about my old aunt? This sort
                    of stuff all of which become relevant to the making of an assignment. I was very
                    impressed. On the other hand, I was also impressed, and here my cynicism was
                    perhaps confirmed, that all of our rules and so on can be broken if there's a
                    will to do it. If it's a matter of a directed assignment by the DG, if the
                    secretary or the seventh floor or even the sixth floor has a compelling need to
                    get his or her boy or girl, ways can be found to do that, and I think that's
                    also good because in the system our size you need a certain amount of
                    flexibility as long as you don't overuse it. And the DG overrides, which is
                    usually the vehicle we use for things if we couldn't make it happen some other
                    way, were rationed out fairly well I thought. So on balance, my view based on
                    three years there, very good system with very good people working on it and with
                    better and better technology.</p>

                        some cases?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Oh yes. We had a very open channel through Jennifer to Tony Quainton
                    and then when they changed through Janice Bay to Skip Gnehm. Skip as the
                    director general had a great advantage that I think almost none of his
                    predecessors have had. He actually had served in CDA as head of the junior
                    officer division I believe.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the best possible preparation for director general.
                        I told him once; I still feel that's probably right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I couldn't agree more, and he even though it had been many years, he
                    knew much more about personnel when he came in as DG than I did at that point. I
                    was still learning. In fact I was learning for my whole three years there. But
                    there were difficult issues inevitably, or unusual issues, and whenever that
                    happened there was a seventh floor interest or the DG wanted to get involved or
                    we thought he should get involved we had almost instant access to him. And both
                    Tony and Skip were very open to that. They both made good decisions I thought.
                    Quick decisions. But they did it based on the presentation that we made. If I
                    couldn't do it I would send the head of the senior office division or whichever
                    division was most involved. But usually I would like to try to get involved
                    myself just to make sure I was in the loop but also to keep fully on top of the
                    subject.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, anything else you want to say about that period
                        which was almost three years in length?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I liked it far more than I had imagined. The deeper I got involved the
                    more I liked it because there was just so much beyond the careers of
                    individuals, the way the system works, systemic issues, consultations with AFSA
                    which I got peripherally involved in. The bureau of personnel started job fairs
                    for techies when I was there. I think that's now an annual event. They really
                    made an effort to upgrade the IT function in the whole bureau and it got better.
                    We yelled and screamed a lot and in retrospect probably a little more than we
                    needed to, but it got steadily better and I think the drumbeat of criticism and
                    the feedback from the experience, the failures as well as the successes helped
                    make it better. I spent a lot of time in the last year on the issue of whether
                    CDA should move into one of the annexes over at Columbia Plaza. A lot of the
                    bureau by that point had already moved or was designated to move over there.
                    This was a building that was gutted and then rehabbed totally as state of the
                    art office space for State Department offices. The personnel bureau was given a
                    number of those, and a good hunk of personnel eventually went over there
                    including I think the files which were so important for the function of the
                    panels and other things that we did in CDA. I decided after a lot of study that
                    we should stay where we were just to be close to the DG and his office, but also
                    to be closer to our clients who were at main State with us before Columbia
                    Plaza. There were a lot of other reasons too. It was a close call; it could have
                    gone either way. I've often wondered if, certainly we would have had much better
                    office space if we'd gone to Columbia Plaza. There was true space there and we
                    were competing against ever increasing numbers of agencies and offices for space
                    in main State before the integration of ACTA and USIA had occurred and there was
                    even more pressure on the existing space in main State. But that was one of my
                    big last decisions and I'm happy I made it the way I did.</p>
                <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, and after that job in personnel you went to the
                        National War College in 1999.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: I managed to get myself assigned in 1999 to the National War College as
                    the international affairs advisor which is essentially the deputy commandant at
                    the National War College. Senior civilian member of the faculty and there were
                    three or four other State Department senior officers on the faculty at the time.
                    I was involved with them and certainly involved very closely with the core of
                    the State students there. Fifteen or twenty each year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were the senior State Department officer in the
                        National War College and then there was a deputy commandant of the National
                        Defense University.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Yes. They called it something else. It's now the vice president, but
                    it's the equivalent of deputy commandant. The NDU or National Defense University
                    sits over both the National War College and the Industrial College down in
                    Norfolk, and each of those entities has a commandant and deputy commandant, so I
                    was the deputy commandant of the War College where I'd been a student some years
                    before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And did you in effect then evaluate the other faculty
                        members or students?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: The practice on that was mixed, it seemed to me, and the short answer
                    to your question is no. I contributed to the evaluation of the students and I
                    had a direct relationship with each of them which I cultivated from their first
                    day there. Counseled them on their onward assignments since that was one of
                    their main interests when they came to the National War College and coming out
                    of three years as head of CDA I figured I had some expertise to counsel them and
                    did indeed. I gave input to their faculty advisors for their overall evaluation
                    but I did not write it. Now my immediate predecessor wrote them all. I could
                    have done that but it seemed to me somewhat artificial that the faculty advisor
                    was more closely involved with them than I was and besides I didn't want to
                    write that many evaluations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The faculty advisor would have been a military officer or
                        civilian?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Either way. What I did do was give input and review the overall
                    evaluation, and if I thought that something needed to be added or taken out or
                    changed in any way I made those suggestions and they were always accepted. Since
                    the evaluation form at NDU is not like a traditional State Department efficiency
                    report, it's a narrative about a page and a half in lieu of an efficiency
                    report. It's not the type of document that's going to get anybody promoted no
                    matter what's in that page and a half normally speaking. On the other hand
                    that's not its purpose. It's designed to show what the student did in that year,
                    10 months at the National War College, both in academic terms and in
                    extracurricular terms, both travel and other things. And I must say the faculty
                    advisors were very thorough in doing that. They tapped all the colleagues who
                    had contact with these students including me and produced pretty good summaries.
                    I was generally satisfied with it. With regard to the other State faculty
                    members, the other senior officers, I really did not rate them. I think all of
                    us were rated by the commandant and reviewed by the vice president of NDU who
                    was Robin Raphel in my last year or two there. In terms of the rating by the
                    commandant we wrote our own as so often happens in the Department of State. The
                    commandants sign without murmur, and in terms of what the review statement was,
                    I think we gave input, maybe even drafts, to Robin and her predecessor. The
                    National War College was to my surprise, because I had been there as a student
                    and thought I knew it fairly well, it was far more collegial and supportive than
                    anything I expected and probably more collegial and supportive than anything I'd
                    ever experienced in my professional career. I say this as somebody who was IT
                    challenged when he came to that job. I discovered that all of my colleagues on
                    the faculty, including the commandant, were much more savvy with the various
                    modules of capability that IT had. They could use it, they could make it work
                    for them, they could tap electronic databases at the stroke of a key, and I knew
                    none of that, and I really was a slow learner. I really have to say all of my
                    colleagues military and civilian who were near me on that corridor spent a lot
                    of time helping me get better. And it wasn't just because I was the national
                    affairs advisor. I saw them spend equal amounts of time helping other people,
                    both faculty members and students, overcome things. There was a commitment there
                    to make sure you succeeded, whether you were a student or a faculty member. Just
                    like Lake Wobegon, no student in the National War College fails. If there is
                    difficulty, and there is with every class, including with State Department
                    students sometimes, they launch a remediation machine that is impressive,
                    including tutoring, retaking the test, whatever it takes to get you up to the
                    standard. I didn't have to pass a test, but I had to get up to standard somewhat
                    on IT and other things, and learned a lot. From the bottom floor to the top I
                    had the most wonderful, supportive colleagues I've ever had. And I've had
                    wonderful colleagues in the Foreign Service, but there's just something, maybe
                    it's the military ethos, maybe it's the resources, I'm not sure what. But the
                    National War College was special. I really think that probably other war
                    colleges are the same.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you travel once a year?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0181" n="Page0181"/>
                <p>WILLIAMS: Once a year we traveled. The highlight of the year and one of the big
                    reasons I wanted to be a student there, and one reason I wanted to go back as a
                    faculty member, was the annual trip. Unfortunately for me, because I was
                    identified with Turkey and taught an elective on Turkey that Peter Galbraith and
                    I created, Turkey and its Neighbors we called it, which is just what it sounds
                    like, a review course of one semester of Turkey with emphasis on Turkey but also
                    Greece, Bulgaria, Syria, whatever. Iraq in particular because...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Cyprus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WILLIAMS: It would depend, according to the interest of those who taught it.
                    Peter was interested in Iraq, I was interested in Greece and Cyprus and we were
                    both interested in Turkey, so we on very short notice wrote up the syllabus for
                    a spring elective, and the elective is key to the trip to Turkey and Syria. We
                    knew we'd get a fair number of students and therefore a fair number or
                    participants in the elective. So the first year I took students to Turkey and
                    Syria, third year Turkey and Greece and I enjoyed it all. Except for Syria, I'd
                    been there before, it was not new. I would have liked to have gone somewhere
                    else but it was 11 days of pretty enjoyable travel. Fairly good meetings
                    although we discovered that in Turkey the embassy essentially had subcontracted
                    this visit to the Turkish general staff which had its own way of dealing with
                    things. Gave us tremendous logistical support, translators, drivers, vans,
                    direct entry into museums and so on. We had fantastic cultural opportunities.
                    The meetings tended to be a bit cut and dry and not as high level as we would
                    have liked. In Syria, very mixed bag. Our trip to Syria was on the cusp of being
                    cut both years because the relationship with Syria was so problematic and
                    sometimes there was a terrorist concern as well. But I would say that the
                    overall experience for the students, certainly for me, was more useful in
                    cultural terms rather than in the substance of any of our meetings. That was my
                    general impression. The Greeks did a very good job by us in the third year.
                    Travel is broadening, and many of these students had never been to any of these
                    countries and therefore gained a lot from it, I think. One of our most unusual
                    things happened in my last year when we were in Istanbul. We went to Robert
                    College and met with the students of the UN association there. These are high
                    school kids from very good families, and some from very poor families in Turkey.
                    Fluent in English, and we spent an afternoon with them just talking about the
                    world. It was for them a chance to pick our brains, meet the students and get
                    their perspective. And then we all went to a dinner at the officers' club right
                    on the Bosporus which the Turkish military hosted. These were an impressive
                    bunch of kids, and I don't think any of the students ever met a group quite like
                    that. Very knowledgeable. Much more so than an average American high school
                    would be, but this was not an average Turkish high school either, a very elite
                    one with kids who are extremely cosmopolitan and well-versed in some of the
                    things we had been studying including Greece and Cyprus and Iraq, so we had
                    interesting discussions.</p>

                <p>WILLIAMS: No, I think the war college was a phenomenal experience, I really

                    was almost never bored, that was one of my criteria for enjoying professional
