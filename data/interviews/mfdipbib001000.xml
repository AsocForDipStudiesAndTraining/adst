                <p>Interviewed by: Morris Weiss</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: February 24, 1994</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On behalf of the Foreign Service Spouse Oral History
                        Program, while I'm here in Florida interviewing Irwin Rubenstein, Mrs.
                        Estelle Rubenstein has agreed to be interviewed also. We're sitting in her
                        new home in Plantation, Florida on Thursday, February 24, 1994.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Mrs. Rubenstein, would you identify yourself as yourself rather than as the wife
                    of a Foreign Service Officer and in regard to your ten-year experience as [the
                    wife of a labor attach�].</p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: My name is Estelle R. Rubenstein. I grew up in Durham, North Carolina
                    where my father was a furniture merchant and my mother did a lot of volunteer
                    work and was a homemaker. I got a degree from the Woman's College of the
                    University of North Carolina in Greensboro, graduated in 1949, and taught for
                    three years in Raleigh, North Carolina — shorthand, typing and bookkeeping.
                    After three years there I went to Washington, DC where I worked as a legal
                    secretary for the Steptoe &amp; Johnson for eight years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a famous law firm that did a whole lot of labor
                        work. Did you do a whole lot of labor work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: No. I worked the first two years for a tax lawyer, Louis A.
                    Boxleitner, who left the firm, and I worked six years as a secretary to the
                    lawyer who was the administrative head, William E. Miller — he ran the law
                    office. The head of the firm was Louis A. Johnson, a former Secretary of Defense
                    under Truman. During that time, in 1958, I met Irwin. We dated off and on and
                    then in early 1960 he was sent to Ecuador on temporary assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For the Foreign Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: For AID. He was supposed to look into the labor situation there for
                    three or four months and write a situation report. Before he left Washington he
                    indicated to me that if he felt the same way when he came back, he would like us
                    to talk about getting married. So, I thought to myself, “Okay, when he comes
                    back, I won't take any courses at George Washington University — I was in the
                    middle of getting my Master's in Education — I thought, since he doesn't like it
                    when I have homework at night and wants me to be free to go out.” And lo and
                    behold, while he was still in Ecuador, they offered him this position as a
                    permanent position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The AID labor position, not attach� position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Not attach�. I think he was called AID labor advisor. So from Ecuador
                    he proposed by letter, and I had to make a very sudden decision about whether I
                    was going to get married, because he wasn't coming back to spend any time, we
                    were not going to have “more time” for what I had in mind of getting to know him
                    better.</p>
                <p>So I said “yes.” He knew he was coming back for two weeks but the government
                    wouldn't tell him which two weeks. So my poor mother had to plan a wedding not
                    knowing the date for it. She was in Durham, NC where I was going to be married,
                    so she lined up the rabbi and the caterer and the orchestra leader and just
                    said, “Stand by, Estelle is getting married.” And truly we didn't know until the
                    last of June when he was returning to the States. The wedding invitations went
                    out on the July 4 weekend and we were married July 17.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good preparation for the Foreign Service!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Oh yes. And just to make things even more interesting, on the weekend
                    of July 4, I went home to Durham for a shower in my honor. I had combined all
                    this with a visit to a gynecologist for a pre-marital exam, and he found that I
                    needed to have an ovary removed. He wanted me to check into the hospital
                    immediately, that hour — it was about 10 a.m. — and I said, “But there are about
                    100 women who are giving a luncheon for me. Is it okay if I attend?”He hesitated
                    and then said, “Okay; right after the luncheon check into the hospital.”</p>
                <p>So that's what I did. They operated on Tuesday. I left the hospital the next
                    Tuesday barely able to walk and we were married the following Sunday; I was
                    barely able to walk down the aisle. We had a one-night honeymoon in Durham, then
                    had to fly to WashingtoA couple of days later, I remember, I went into Woodward
                    &amp; Lothrop because overseas I wouldn't have a chance to shop for anything, I
                    needed a lot of kitchen things. I walked in, the saleswoman said, “May I help
                    you?” and I said, “Yes, [she laughs] “do you have a chair where I can sit down?
                    Then we can talk about what I want to buy.”</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>So two weeks after we were married under those circumstances I arrived in
                    Guayaquil, Ecuador. I was a person who had never, never wanted to travel before
                    — if you had given me a million dollars, travel was the last thing I would have
                    done. There were only two places in the world I had thought I would like to see
                    — Israel and Switzerland. And here I was: in Guayaquil, Ecuador. And I loved
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the strangeness?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: It didn't seem strange, everybody was so friendly, the people I met
                    in the consulate, and the Ecuadorians — everybody was very warm and friendly;
                    and the climate was warm, which I enjoyed. Guayaquil was at sea level, it's on
                    the Guayas River. Many people think of this city as a hell hole. I loved it, I
                    really did; it was fascinating. I took lots of home movies just wandering around
                    all by myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you know Spanish at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Well, that's a good question. When I was in college when I was 18, I
                    had two years of Spanish. I got married when I was 32, never having used Spanish
                    at all. But I had had a wonderful teacher at Duke University, Mrs. Dillingham,
                    so I had a great basis for grammar and vocabulary. My freshman year was at Duke,
                    then I transferred to the Woman's College (in Greensboro) and had a second year
                    of Spanish there. My first year's Spanish was really an accelerated course, two
                    years in one. I had very good grammatical background and vocabulary; I won't go
                    into her teaching method but it was the most marvelous way of teaching a
                    language. Unfortunately, even with all her wonderful teaching I didn't speak the
                    language fluently, I just knew a lot of words, and knew the grammar.</p>
                <p>So when I arrived in Ecuador it was hard for me to understand Spanish although I
                    could speak it, and could do so correctly. I got a tutor right away and he
                    marveled at how much I remembered since I was 18 — all the exceptions to the
                    rules, things like that. But even to this day I'm not as efficient at hearing
                    Spanish as I'd like it be. I can get my ideas across, at sort of a Three level,
                    and I enjoyed the language very much.</p>
                <p>But getting back to Guayaquil, I really did love the city. And I must say that
                    even though I had never wanted to travel, I enjoyed every post that we ever
                    lived in. I was always happy while I was there and I was sorry to leave each
                    time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much was this liking Guayaquil related to the fact
                        that in many of these interviews we see that people have an affection for
                        the first post they're exposed to and some people find it very difficult.
                        Some people have a special feeling for their first post.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: I've heard that but I don't think it applies to me. I really feel
                    that I liked all the posts equally. Although most of them were in Latin America,
                    they were all very different. Our circumstances changed too, and we started
                    having children and things like that; so each place was different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At this point, did you have regrets about having a career
                        while overseas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: None whatsoever. From the time I was a little girl I wanted to have
                    children, so although I enjoyed my three years of teaching and my eight years as
                    legal secretary, I wanted to have children, I wanted to be a wife and mother.
                    And that was very important to me. It never entered my mind that I was in second
                    position. I was wife and hostess and mother. We had our first child at the end
                    of our tour in Guayaquil</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of jobs did you have other than parent and wife?
                        Did the children like Foreign Service life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: In Uruguay I wrote a newsletter for the American Womens' Group; in
                    Israel and Mexico I edited cookbooks for the Embassy Womens' Group.</p>
                <p>Well, I have to skip ahead many years and tell you that when we were in Tel Aviv
                    a very good friend of mine said to our firstborn, who was then a teenage girl,
                    “Ellen, tell me about the problems you had growing up overseas.” My daughter
                    looked at her and said, “What problems?” And, really, I think that was the
                    attitude of all our kids. They loved it. I still remember, when we were living
                    in Washington for three years and it was our children's really first experience
                    of living in the States — they were all in elementary school, they got used to
                    Washington and TV programs, which they never had overseas — Irwin came home at
                    the end of those three years — my mother was visiting, I remember that so
                    clearly — he came home and said, “We're going to live in Managua, Nicaragua” and
                    my children said, “WHOOPEE!” and I was so embarrassed because my mother could
                    se(laughing) that my kids were very happy to be leaving the United States. You
                    know, my mother looked at Foreign Service as something like, “when are they
                    going to let you come back to the States?” that as though coming to the U.S. was
                    a goal of ours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the ages of your children at the time they
                        expressed themselves in that way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN:Michael was by then nine, Lisa was 12 and Ellen was 14.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they were leaving all their friends at school, because
                        junior high is a time when you make friends and nevertheless they had
                        remembered so much of their earlier experience in the Foreign Service that
                        they ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: They loved overseas life, they felt it was easier to make friends
                    because there were a lot of other kids who were in the same boat. Coming back to
                    the States was difficult for them. They didn't come back very often. That one
                    time was for three years, then we only came back, as far as public school was
                    concerned, one time in 1978 from January until June, when we were studying
                    Hebrew right before we went to Israel. Then two of our girls graduated from The
                    American School while we were in Israel. From Israel we went to Mexico City
                    where our son graduated from high school. So they didn't have very much time in
                    the States except for home leave; their schooling was mostly overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We can get into the question of their education and
                        various other things that happened in their early life after we continue
                        with you. You were a Foreign Service wife doing a lot of entertaining. Did
                        the subject matter of Irwin's work interest you at all, or ... ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: The fact that he wanted to help laborers interested me in general. I
                    never got involved with the nitty gritty of his work but we did a lot of
                    entertaining not because he was in labor but because he was Irwin Rubenstein and
                    he's a “people person” and he just likes to have a lot of people around all the
                    time and entertain. As a matter of fact, when we got to Ecuador and I was
                    house-hunting, the thing uppermost in his mind was, “let's get in a house so we
                    can have a housewarming party.”By then, since he had been in Ecuador four months
                    before I got down there, he knew hundreds and hundreds of people and he
                    wante[laughing] to have them all over to the house. The first party I ever gave
                    was for about 200 people. It was a nightmare for me bu[laughing even more] it
                    was a very successful party. I prepared all the food. I had a maid but I didn't
                    have enough sense to know about caterers!</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Yes. I remember consulting with him when I was in college because
                    something had come up about a certain labor leader and I wanted to get my
                    father's viewpoint to sort of give me a starting point on how I should view John
                    L. Lewis in relation to what other people were saying. And my parents always
                    supported the labor government in Israel, for example.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: It was very small. He had a bookkeeper and his brother. He had a

                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Not at all. And he knew also the background of my mother's mother,
                    who got arrested in the early 1900s in Russia under the Czar, as a girl of 18,
                    for distributing pamphlets trying to organize workingmen. She was put in prison
                    for several months and lost teeth because of malnutrition and was in bad shape.
                    There was an amnesty declared and she was freed, along with her then boy friend,
                    and they fled Russia, got as far as London, then eventually to the United
                    States. My mother came to this country when she was nine months old.</p>

                        wonderful early years in the Foreign Service. You've had many fewer problems
                        than some of the people I've interviewed which you dealt with successfully.
                        Any special things that you'd like to mention? The thing I didn't bring with
                        me was a list, which I'll show you another time, of things which you should
                        mention — special difficulties with children, special difficulties with
                        entertaining, special difficulties, if you had them, with the wives of your
                        husband's superiors. The situation that we found, even back then, was the
                        disposition of some of the wives of younger officers to accept, much more
                        than they do now, the idea that the wife of my husband's boss has something
                        to say about ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Our first husband-wife deal was not in the capital, so we did not
                    have to deal with the ambassador and his wife and they didn't have to bother
                    with us either. Our consul general was Ward C. Allen and his wife “Mid”, who
                    were wonderful, wonderful people, we loved them dearly. I still correspond with
                    Mid and this is from 1960 to 1994. Ward, unfortunately, died a few years ago but
                    we're still very good friends with Mid. So that was a lovely post, I mean, there
                    was...</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Okay, there are smaller posts, but this was small to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But she was a Foreign Service wife, in the diplomatic
                        corps, whereas Irwin was in the AID Mission.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Yes, but still Ward Allen was his boss, there's no question about
                    that, but Ward Allen was the kind of person who, if he was driving along toward
                    home, if he saw a pothole in the street he would get out and push some rocks
                    into the hole, to make things better for the next person. We had one experience
                    when the Ambassador's wife was coming down to Guayaquil for a tea and everybody
                    in the consulate was up in arms — “What are you going to wear? Are you going to
                    wear stockings?” (laughing) We didn't wear stockings in Guayaquil, it was a
                    tropical city. And a hat, and gloves and all the rest of it, and we talked about
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>Finally the day came. We got there early and somebody went to put the centerpiece
                    on the dining room table and some of the water spilled out and they had to take
                    everything off and iron the tablecloth real fast — it was very hectic, very
                    chaotic. Then we all sat around for the tea and it got to be five-thirty and we
                    knew that we couldn't leave until the ambassador's wife left. And some of the
                    women had little children, and families to feed and so forth, and we couldn't
                    leave and we couldn't leave. Well, finally, I guess it was about six o'clock,
                    some of the women did start sneaking out, and since I didn't have any children
                    at the time and I figured Irwin knew where I was, I stayed till the bitter end.
                    I later learned that the ambassador's wife felt that she was sort of hostessing
                    this thing and didn't feel she had to leave! (laughing heartily)</p>
                <p>Anyway, later we got to Lima, Peru and the ambassador's wife was very laid back,
                    there was practically nothing ordered from the top down. If it was time for the
                    embassy to collect for the Red Cross, for example, for the country of Peru, she
                    would get together the wives of the department heads, have a little meeting with
                    them and they would do whatever they did and the rest of us never really were
                    involved. As a matter of fact, a very good friend of mine whose husband was with
                    AID and saw that there was no organization of embassy wives and she had just
                    come from Turkey where there was a big AID contingency, started an AID
                    organization and it became very active but it wasn't embassy, it was...</p>

                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Yes, sort of like that. And then, I don't remember any untoward
                    pressure from above. Our next post was Uruguay and the Ambassador's wife there
                    was, I think, unsure of herself and there may have been some personality
                    problems. But we all rolled with the punches, and it was during that time that
                    the edict came down that wives are not part of their husband's work ...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Irwin in the Foreign Service then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Yes. The chronology is that he was with AID for two years, then we
                    went back to Washington for about a year on loan to the Labor Department, and
                    then we went in laterally to the State Department, so our first three years were
                    not State Department but after that, yes.</p>

                <p>RUBENSTEIN: No, I didn't teach after I got married. I did a lot of volunteer work
                    but didn't teach again; just during the three years before I worked for Steptoe
                    &amp; Johnson. A lot of volunteer work and a lot of entertaining.</p>

                    our tour ended, three and a half years later, we had a third child, whom I
                    carried in my arms as we were leaving Peru. So I didn't have a lot of spare time
                    there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All three of your children were born abroad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Right. The first in Ecuador and two in Peru. So I was a little busy
                    in Peru, I didn't do an awful lot of volunteer work then. In Uruguay the
                    children were still small and I was busy with their school activities. Oh, and
                    in the last nine months of our three and a half years in Uruguay was the era of
                    the Tupamaro Terrorism, so our life changed drastically because of that. One
                    night a Tupamaro group came to our house with the intention of kidnaping Irwin.
                    There was a knock on the door and I didn't open it, A man asked for “Ingeniero
                    Rubenstein.” Well, Irwin is not an engineer, so I didn't open the door, I said,
                    “He doesn't live here.” Our house was long and narrow, so the man must have
                    thought it was two apartments or two houses. He went around to the kitchen door
                    and asked again for “Ingeniero Rubenstein.” I repeated that he didn't live there
                    and the man left. Irwin had looked out our bedroom window and had seen him
                    coming up the driveway with, it looked like, a briefcase and something else
                    rolled up under his arm — I'm not sure now of all these details — but after this
                    man left we got inquiries from both of our neighbors, one of whom we had never
                    talked to, and he reported that this man had been lurking around and his dog had
                    been barking.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was not an American?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: No, an Uruguayan. And the woman on the other side came over to ask if
                    we were all right because she said a man had been asking a lot of questions
                    about us. So there was something going on. Irwin reported this to the embassy
                    and from that night on everybody in the embassy had 24-hour guards, Uruguayan
                    security people — sometimes they stayed in the house, sometimes they were up on
                    the roof, or lived in the house; they became like members of the family. In the
                    morning when Embassy officers left their houses to go to the Embassy, the guards
                    would come in a convoy — three cars full of guns; the Americans rode, I think,
                    I'm not sure, in the middle car, maybe there were guns in front and back. The
                    guard would accompany the officer to the car, then another guard who stayed in
                    our house would accompany our children to the school bus, which stopped in front
                    of the house. It was very difficult.</p>

                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: None. (she laughs heartily)The kids played with the guards, and I
                    went about my business, because the feeling was that the Tupamaros would not
                    harm wives and children. So if I had to go to the supermarket, I went, and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So in Uruguay you had your first experience with those
                        security people, which didn't affect your work adversely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: No, didn't affect my family. The men were, well, there was a lot of
                    tension at the beginning, and we became much more aware of our surroundings. One
                    night we went down to the embassy to meet some people to go to a movie and the
                    guards accompanied us to a certain point downtown, then we got out of the car
                    and were on our own after that. They felt that the dangerous parts were when you
                    were leaving and arriving at the embassy, but as long as you'd left, (laughing),
                    they didn't care, they didn't follow you around every minute.</p>
                <p>So we were walking along on our way to the movie and I remember Irwin either
                    nudging me or whispering to me and we stopped in front of a store window in
                    order to see the reflection of who was behind us — the men were suspicious
                    because they felt someone was following us. It turned out the guards were
                    following u(laughing again) to see that we were all right but the officers
                    hadn't recognized them at first! That's one of the very few things that I can
                    recall. I do remember when we gave a party one night and had invited a lot of
                    the embassy people who were walking around with guns as part of their job. When
                    they entered the hous(she laughs) we made them check their guns in the closet
                    out of the way of the children.</p>

                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Cali, Colombia. That was so-o-o lovely. Again, not the capital city.
                    It had perfect weather, eternal spring. We had a lovely home, after we got it
                    fixed up, because it had deteriorated. The kitchen was a disaster; we sent
                    pictures of it to the embassy to show what it looked like. Seeing Irwin later,
                    the ambassador asked, “What slum are you living in?” It was unbelievable — this
                    beautiful home with gorgeous swimming pool and so forth, and the kitchen you
                    wouldn't believe. Underneath the sink the shelf had rusted, you could have put a
                    basketball in the hole. There was no hot water. Such a mess.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it an embassy house?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you had a job ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Yes, and when we left it was a beautiful kitchen; yellow Formica,
                    stainless steel. I think it's now owned by a drug vendor. There's no consulate
                    there now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Irwin there a Labor officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: No. In Cali he was consul.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll get to that when we interview him. And still, the
                        kids are getting along fine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Very happy. They had really good schools — good teachers, good
                    schools. When we were in Uruguay there was an American school but it had just
                    been started and some of the people who were living there at the time didn't
                    send their children there and didn't recommend it highly to us; they did
                    recommend a British school, St. Andrew's, where both of our girls began their
                    schooling. It was a really good school so far as basics were concerned —
                    reading, arithmetic, discipline and all that. I didn't realize until I got back
                    to the U.S. after Colombia the contrast: in Uruguay there had been no
                    parent-school relationships, we were not invited ever to come see anything.
                    Well, their school was not a school building, it was a house, really, they
                    didn't have an auditorium or a real school playground — a few tires and a few
                    swings — but we weren't invited until the last day to come walk around the room
                    and see things on the bulletin board and take home the child's folder. And when
                    I returned to the States, the contrast was quite strong, with the PTA and
                    monthly meetings and all that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the children disadvantaged because of that type of
                        school when they got back to the American system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: No, because the educational part was very strong. No, they were never
                    disadvantaged as far as their education was concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, on the other hand, you think there was some advantage
                        to all those ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Oh yes, because the classes were smaller and they had more individual
                    attention. Yes, they all know Spanish. Our second child Lisa is now married,
                    she's close to 30, she went to Jamaica last year to live with her husband and
                    got a job teaching Spanish on five different levels in a private school. She
                    married a man who is Indian, whose parents are from India but where he has never
                    lived, born in Ghana where his father was an engineer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say your daughter is in Jamaica now and has begun to
                        teach, which indicates that her Spanish is also very good. The other
                        children's language?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: They're good in Spanish. Our oldest daughter doesn't have
                    opportunities to use it but when she does, her accent is perfect, so is our
                    son's. And they enjoy speaking Spanish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any Hebrew?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: They all went to school for three years in Israel and they studied
                    Hebrew. I don't know how good their Hebrew is. I know I got to a certain
                    conversational level but I probably wouldn't be able to say more than a sentence
                    now. As a child, I knew how to read and write Hebrew, and I how to read the
                    prayer books, and before we went to Israel I had about two months at the Foreign
                    Service Institute. When we got to Tel Aviv I enrolled in the Ulpan, with the
                    immigrants, and studied for four months intensively and got to be good, I
                    thought. I could speak in Hebrew all night at a party with one person about
                    basic things. Unfortunately, I have lost most of that facility.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we were going from post to post. Any special events
                        or types of work you did?</hi>

                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: There was something interesting, I think, that happened in Cali.
                    You'll recall that earlier I mentioned Mid Allen, wife of Ward Allen? Well, when
                    we were in Cali, they were in Bogota and Mid came down for a visit one day and I
                    took her sightseeing. When we came back — our house was built at street level
                    and there were gratings separating the garage from the sidewalk — our maid was
                    on the inside and a young man was on the outside and she took me aside and told
                    me that he was a Cuban who was in Colombia for the Pan American Games and wanted
                    to defect. She was just standing there talking with him and didn't know what to
                    do. I looked at Mid Allen, who in my estimation had all kinds of relevant
                    knowledge and experience, and asked, “What do we do?” She said, “Take him into
                    the house.” Which we did. We gave him tea or Coca Cola or whatever. He was a
                    cyclist on the Cuban team, and I called Irwin immediately. I think he wasn't in
                    his office, because for some time we didn't know exactly what we were supposed
                    to be doing and we just sat and talked with the young man for perhaps an hour. I
                    finally got Irwin and he gave me some instructions. [End of Tape 1, Side A;
                    Begin Tape 1, Side B]</p>
                <p>... but they seemed unclear to me because subsequently a man came to the door —
                    the maid told us he wanted to take the Cuban away. I didn't know who this man
                    was and I wasn't about to hand over the Cuban without knowing. I told the maid
                    to tell the man he couldn't come in and would have to wait until I heard from my
                    husband. I think it was about an hour later I found out that the man I had kept
                    waiting was the equivalen(she laughs) of the head of the FBI for Colombia, and I
                    wouldn't let him in the house!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A very good response! You should have gotten a star in
                        your diplomatic passport for that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Anyway, it was an interesting and unique experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else to mention there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: We enjoyed Cali very much. As I said, the weather was ideal, the
                    people were friendly, the children were very happy in an excellent school, we
                    had a beautiful home. We were there for two lovely years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And after Cali?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: We went back to Washington for those three years that were my
                    children's first experience of living in the U.S. and attending public schools.
                    They had some negative, some positive experiences. My son had good teachers, one
                    daughter had good teachers, the third child was in a combined class — two sixth
                    grades, with only one teacher who had to be a genius and a saint to run two such
                    classes, and she was neither.She was inexperienced and in an impossible
                    situation, so my daughter was very glad the next year to be out of that class,
                    it was like a zoo. And they were absolutely ecstatic when they learned we would
                    be leaving the States and going overseas again! They were happy about going to
                    Nicaragua even though they knew nothing about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they make friends in school and were such friendships
                        maintained during periods overseas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: My older daughter did make friends that she maintained but she's the
                    kind that maintains friends wherever, she's still in touch with some kids she
                    went to school with when she was five or six years old. She finds them
                    an(laughing) doesn't let them get “lost.”Lisa had a few; I don't think Michael
                    is still in contact with any of his friends from overseas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any special experiences during those three years other
                        than normal ones like coming back home?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: I learned to live without a maid. I should add that even while we
                    were overseas I was always very strict with the maids on the fact that the
                    children had to pick up their own toys and their own clothes and from the time
                    they were five or six years old they made their own beds. So that aspect wasn't
                    such a big change. Ellen, the oldest, was 12, so if we wanted to go to a movie
                    she could babysit the two younger ones, her sister who was 10 and her brother
                    who was seven.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find some advantages to not having a maid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: (laughing heartily) Not too many! There were some advantages to being
                    back in that we didn't feel the need to entertain so much, but I was very busy
                    chauffeuring the children to different lessons — ballet and drum and flute and
                    piano, you know, the usual; and myself active in the PTA and so forth. I can't
                    think of any other specific ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After those three years, you went to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Managua, Nicaragua.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And there, the children had the same sort of experiences
                        they had had before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Yes, they enjoyed it very much. And so did I. Irwin was deputy chief
                    of mission [DCM] and my duties were a little different but we still had to
                    entertain as always.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of your “duties,” you realize now you're
                        expressing the old-fashioned version of the wife.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Oh yes, I guess I never got over that. It's true, I'm not of the new
                    generation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In that respect</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your husband was the DCM in Nicaragua for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Two years. In January I left with the children so they could enter
                    school for the second semester, and Irwin was supposed to follow in two weekAt
                    that point Somoza started having many problems and the Department didn't want
                    Irwin to leave so soon. Two weeks stretched to two months, so instead of living
                    in a motel for two weeks and then the whole family moving into the house, I
                    moved in with the three children, I got the house ready, unpacked, and when
                    everything was completely unpacked, Irwin came home. As he got off the plane, he
                    said, “How would you like to go to Israel?”</p>
                <p>We had about four more months for the children to finish the semester, then about
                    two months of Hebrew training, and then in the summer we left for Israel. We
                    lived there for three years, Irwin serving as labor officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He'll be telling me about that. And your reactions?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Well, the funny thing is that when we were living in Nicaragua my
                    mother was in Miami and wanted to take a second trip to Israel — her first visit
                    was in the 50s, when conditions were very bad — food was scarce, and so forth.
                    She wanted to go back and her second husband didn't want to travel by plane and
                    she asked me if I'd like to travel with her. My situation in Nicaragua was ideal
                    for leavin(laughing) I mean, I had a live-in cook, a maid, houseboy, ironing
                    woman, gardener — my family wouldn't even miss me, so I left and was gone for
                    three weeks. We have a lot of family in Israel, my mother's first cousins, seven
                    of them, and their children and grandchildren. So we traveled for three weeks
                    with the American-Jewish Congress tour called “Israel in Depth” and it really
                    was in depth, I felt that I saw everything, I met my relatives — who asked me,
                    “Isn't there some chance that your husband would be sent to Israel?” And I said
                    no, “because he's a Latin American specialist.” And that's why it was so funny
                    when he came home from Nicaragua and said, (laughing) “How would you like to go
                    to Israel?” I couldn't believe it.</p>
                <p>So, we went. I got to know my extended family better over there. Our son was bar
                    mitzvah'd in Israel, the two girls finished high school in the American
                    school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were studying Hebrew there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any difficulties there because you were Jewish</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: In Israel? No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, some people who are Jewish who served in the embassy
                        feel at a slight disadvantage, that they have to lean over backwards to be a
                        proper diplomat at posts like that. I'll be talking to Irwin about
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: The reaction we have had from some people who are not in the
                    diplomatic service is, “Oh, I didn't know that they sent Jews to Israel.” So
                    Irwin then proceeds to name all the people who were in the political section
                    when we were there and I think six out of the seven were all Jewish. Maybe in
                    olden days there was a different attitude.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a time when, yes. So that experience was good
                        too. Your continued good experiences leads me to feel that you must have
                        earned that attitude by yourself being warm and open. After Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: We went to Mexico City, Irwin again being labor attach�. By then our
                    two daughters were in college. Our son was with us, finishing high school there.
                    I did volunteer work as “Pink Lady” in the American-British-Cowdray, the ABC
                    Hospital there for three years. I was the only woman at the embassy who ever did
                    that — I don't know why; it was a very nice experience; it was my main volunteer
                    work there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went directly from Mexico City to Guadalajara?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: There was uncertainty as we were leaving Mexico City as to whether we
                    were going to Guadalajara. We packed up and all of our earthly belongings went
                    to Washington. By the time they arrived the powers that be said, “Oh, he's going
                    to Guadalajara” so everything turned around and went back. Irwin can go into
                    more detail. We were there four years. Irwin was consul general.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And there your position differed, you were the wife of the
                        chief of mission. From that vantage point, what was your relation to the
                        spouses and other members of the staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: We had a little organization of consulate wives, which met in our
                    house once a month. That's where I spent about a year collecting recipes and
                    editing a bilingual cookbook.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time there's a new situation in which spouses of
                        Foreign Service officers have the opportunity to be employed by the
                        government. Did any of them at that post or in Mexico enter the Service?
                        What problems did you note, if any?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Some of them worked in the consulate at Guadalajara but were not
                    members of the Foreign Service; in Mexico City, some were; there were tandem
                    couples.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel as though that was a worse or better
                        situation than in the “old days,” as you describe them when wives did not
                        have those possibilities for employment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: I always felt that, for myself, after I got married and had children,
                    I had enough to do in the home with family and entertaining and volunteer work,
                    that the thought of working for salary never interested me. If I had wanted to
                    work for a salary, I could not possibly have done the other things well. Maybe
                    some people can.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's summarize your volunteer activities and what the
                        remuneration was in non-financial terms. I gather that when the kids were
                        young you didn't do much if any of that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: No. I was busy with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later on you began the Pink Lady business and so on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Also in Guadalajara I read some books for the Blind organization,
                    once a week in English. The organization had a little room set up that was
                    soundproof.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything else you'd like to cover? So far, you haven't
                        given one word about any honors you've gotten or anything. Irwin reported
                        that you had some recognition for your volunteer work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Well, one very nice woman on the staff in Guadalajara wrote me up to
                    nominate me for something. Somebody else won but I thought it was very nice that
                    she did what she did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought it was very modest of you not to mention the
                        fact that this was for the Avis Bohlen award. (laughing) How will we get
                        this without my pressing you to say that this is quite a prestigious
                        nomination. What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>RUBENSTEIN: Somebody else won! (hearty laughter) But I felt very honored to be
                    nominated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your modesty is admirable, I'll try to worm more out of
                        Irwin. (They discuss possibility and details of her transcribing the
                        interview.) Now I'll start interviewing Irwin.</hi>
