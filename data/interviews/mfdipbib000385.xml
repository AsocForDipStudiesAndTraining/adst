                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could give me a bit about your
                        background—where you came from, born, educated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: I was born May 8, 1921 in Chicago. I went to public school for grammar
                    school, and later to a private military prep school in the Chicago suburbs, and
                    then to Carleton College where I got my Bachelor of Arts degree just before
                    getting into the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your major in college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: International relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had a feel for...you were interested in...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: I knew I was interested anyway. Then let's see. Pearl Harbor was in my
                    junior year. I fortunately had enough credits accumulated so that I was able to
                    graduate in 3 1/4 years, so I very neatly got my BA degree just before I went
                    into the Army. I had a certificate of eligibility to be commissioned, related to
                    having gone to this essentially military prep school. So the day after Pearl
                    Harbor, on Monday morning, right after President Roosevelt declared war, I
                    hitchhiked through a blinding snowstorm, 40 miles, from Northfield, Minnesota up
                    to Minneapolis to Fort Snelling to say, “Hey, I want to get into the Army”. That
                    was on December 9, 1941. I didn't actually get into the Army until September 10
                    in '42. But once I did, I was in North Africa three months later. Things moved
                    fast. My program in college was International Relations, with some strength in
                    foreign languages. Then I was in the Army in the war in North Africa and Europe
                    for three and a half years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of work were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: I was an Infantry Officer.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which Division?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: I was assigned to Allied Force Headquarters, since I spoke good French. By
                    American school standards my French was rather good, but among Infantry Officers
                    it was parliamentarian! So I ended up doing a lot of liaison work. I saw a lot
                    of the 34th Infantry Division—the Minnesota National Guard Division—in North
                    Africa. I later did some work with the Third and the Thirty-Sixth—the Texas
                    National Guard, but I was mainly with about four different French divisions. I
                    was in the August 15, 1944 landing in the South of France. I was later in an
                    operation behind the German lines in Occupied France. I do not want to overstate
                    this. It was very much toward the end of things, when the Germans still held the
                    Southwest one-third of France. I did not parachute in. I went in by what was
                    known as “Overland Infiltration”. I was there for a couple of months. In
                    December, 1945 I came home, got demobilized. Then went straight to graduate
                    school—the School of Advanced International Studies in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At Johns Hopkins?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: It now belongs to Johns Hopkins. Then it had just been established by
                    Christian Herter, Paul Nitze and others. I did that for one year; went into the
                    Foreign Service the day after I got my MA. After a few months in training, I was
                    assigned to Paris, where I stayed for five and a half years. The reason behind
                    this happy first assignment was that since I had been with the French Army
                    during the war and had had some exposure to the French Resistance, the State
                    Department personnel people felt I could be helpful to the Labor Attach� because
                    of all my possible access to Communist trade-union types. Actually, these people
                    would have gladly cut my throat, but if Personnel decided that was a good reason
                    to send me to Paris, I certainly didn't argue with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you work at all with Irving Brown?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: Oh yes, I knew Irving Brown. He had other people working more directly
                    with him, but I certainly tried to be helpful to him in any way I could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a major figure in the post World War
                        American/French labor relations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '47 -'52 in Paris. What was your
                        impression of the political situation at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: The French, of course, were very divided, as they had indeed been during
                    the war. They were perhaps in some danger of going Communist. I wouldn't say
                    they were on the very brink, but it was, in some respects, touch and go. If we
                    had not carried out the Marshall Plan as we did, there certainly would have been
                    considerable disorder, probably some fighting, and the whole recovery of Europe
                    would have been much delayed. But I wouldn't go quite so far as to say that they
                    were all that close to the brink of going Communist. There were a lot of
                    conservative forces at work in France that would probably have pulled them back
                    from the brink in good time. But it was worrisome. In a nutshell, the Marshall
                    Plan did a wonderful job. In the Embassy in Paris, I had a ringside seat on that
                    and knew the people who were running it—David Bruce, Averell Harriman, Henry
                    Tasca, Paul Porter, and all those good people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of David Bruce as the Ambassador?
                        How did he run things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: First rate. First rate in every way. Personally, substantively. He had run
                    the OSS Mission in London during the War and was, of course, a hands-on solver
                    of problems—inclined that way. Whenever there was a rumor of some hidden Nazi,
                    like Martin Bormann, for example—rumors that he was in Spain or France. David
                    Bruce pursued the matter with more direct involvement than you would expect from
                    an Ambassador to a large country. And he very much encouraged his boys who were
                    looking after these things. He was also a very gracious gentleman. I served
                    later under him in Germany as well, and he was just first rate. As was Averell
                    Harriman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Averell Harriman was a different type wasn't he? How did
                        you find him? He was running the aid...the Marshall Plan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: What was it called? The Economic Cooperation...Administration, I think. It
                    went through various names. Averell Harriman was perhaps more directly connected
                    to the political administration in Washington. But Bruce was also a very
                    distinguished Democrat and had good ties in Washington, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give an idea, a feel for how we viewed the French
                        government at that time. I mean it was the beginning of these series of
                        governments that kept changing, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>FLOTT: Yes, they changed a lot. They had some good people in it who were
                    individually bright. Their collective efforts were often subject to divisions
                    determined by French politics and French social structure and other factors. But
                    looking back on it and taking into account where they came from in terms of just
                    having been through the initial defeat by Germany, the rest of the war, and the
                    rather spotty Liberation period, I would give them credit for being pretty broad
                    gauge and reasonably willing to be able to forgive and forget, at least to work
                    constructively with the Germans and others in Europe. “Forgive and forget” would
                    be overstating it, but they were willing to take an objective view of where
                    their interests lay, and to pursue these interests intelligently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we having to be careful or not, not to rake over the
                        coals of the occupation time. There were all sorts of people who were
                        tainted in one way or another by collaboration. How did we treat that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: First of all, there was not a policy laid down. There was the case by case
                    action, by people of stature and experience, and the normal exercise of good
                    sense. There was perhaps a feeling that you catch more flies with molasses than
                    you do with vinegar and that, at a certain point, you have to let bygones be
                    bygones in favor of producing results. The French government was very generous
                    about overstating, if anything, the importance of the Resistance movement,
                    partly because it got France off the hook of having been so largely
                    collaborationist. The French political scene during the war was pretty much
                    collaborationist. The extent to which this was the case is still coming out in
                    the latest writings on the subject in France.</p>
                <p>So the best way to expunge some of that from the record was to talk about how
                    magnificent the Resistance had been. The U.S. government, of course, let the
                    French run their internal affairs.</p>
                <p>I don't remember any formal or hard positions we took on the subject.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a very critical period from '47-51. Things were
                        beginning to harden into the Cold War. What were our relations with the
                        different labor movements—the Communists on one side and the Socialist on
                        the other?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>FLOTT: The largest trade union movement, the most broadly based one, was the
                    C.G.T. While leftist, it was, of course, not totally Communist. Although
                    obviously heavily infiltrated and influenced by Communists, C.G.T. leaders would
                    deal in a civil way with their American trade unionist brothers, which was why
                    the work of people like Irving Brown was so important. Irving Brown and other
                    American labor people over there were good patriots who were willing to hear
                    what the Embassy had to say on the subjects. So we felt, as an Embassy we felt,
                    we had enough input into the process, On the other hand, the extreme Communists,
                    the ones who went even beyond the trade union movement, criticized anything the
                    Americans did. We made food deliveries under the Marshall Plan. They criticized
                    that. They'd say that powdered eggs from America are bad for you. The French had
                    had a bad harvest in 1947, and the Marshall Plan sent massive quantities of
                    cornmeal as a substitute for flour. Cornmeal was new to them, and the Communists
                    said that this is fed only to pigs. I remember in “L'Humanit�", the French
                    Communist newspaper, they ran a large cartoon criticizing the Marshall Plan. It
                    showed a ship being unloaded and they included in the cartoon what they claimed
                    were the three worst things the Americans were shipping to France—the three
                    things the Communists wanted to criticize most. One was armament—showed a cannon
                    being off-loaded; then big barrels of powdered eggs coming off, which would give
                    any Frenchman indigestion just seeing it; and the third worst thing were cases
                    marked Champagne from California—”Champagne de Californie”!</p>
                <p>But the Communists couldn't go too far out; they could play on popular frames of
                    reference and prejudices and things of that sort, but they couldn't get too
                    directly anti-American, because the French people did regard the Americans as
                    their liberators.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with Maurice Thorez, the head of
                        the French Communist Party?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: I certainly didn't deal with him directly. I may have met him at some
                    reception, but I doubt it. He was not working the Embassies circuit! He was,
                    after all, a foreign agent who had deserted from the French Army at the time of
                    the Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact, when Moscow was attacking French mobilization
                    against the Nazis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we consider the French Communist Party, with Thorez as
                        its head, the absolute tool of the Kuomintang or of the Soviets, or not at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: A tool of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet
                    Union? Oh, absolutely, no doubt about it. Now that doesn't mean that every
                    single Frenchman who voted Communist, was equally in their pocket, but the
                    leadership—there's no doubt about it. That's been proven—there's documentation
                    of it both from defectors from the French and from the Soviet Communist parties.
                    But the French Communists did get a substantial protest vote from some otherwise
                    patriotic French people, especially right after the war.</p>

                        as their ties to the Soviets in Europe, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: Yes, I guess they were. Maurice Thorez is a complicated story. In 1939 the
                    reason the Germans felt secure in invading Poland was that they were
                    hand-in-glove with the Russians in doing so. At that point, when France went to
                    war, along with Great Britain in September '39; Thorez first deserted from the
                    French Army and secondly announced that this was a bourgeois, capitalistic war
                    that the people should have no part of. But, needless to say, on June 22 of '41,
                    when the Germans invaded the Soviet Union, Thorez changed his tune immediately.
                    But there's no doubt that once the Germans invaded the Soviet Union, the French
                    Communists became the most militant elements in the Resistance. They were
                    willing to do anything to kill a handful of Germans, even if it meant the
                    destruction of whole French villages and everything else. They went all out,
                    which made them attractive in some ways to people around them who planned
                    operations against the Germans. But the French, the bourgeois middle class
                    French, were basically suspicious of the Communists, and with good reason. But
                    it would be hard to deny that among the forces fighting in the Resistance, the
                    Communists were the most all-out and militant—of late date, of course, after the
                    invasion of Russia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other Labor Officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: It was basically Irving Brown's people who came and went and there would
                    be Foreign Service Officers in the labor attach� business. From where I sat,
                    first at a very modest level in the Consular Section, and later in the Economic
                    Section; we talked with them. All the people there at that time—we had a
                    collegial relation with them—and anything we learned that might be helpful to
                    them, we passed on to Irving Brown and his people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Paris in 1952?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: Yes, September, 1952.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Madrid for a while?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>FLOTT: Yes. In August 1951, the Marshall Plan, whatever it was called then...MSA,
                    ECA,—whatever, decided to have a very limited involvement in Spain. Now Spain
                    was not a Marshall Plan country. It had been pro-German during the War, and
                    still had a fascist government, so it wasn't likely to get Marshall Plan aid.
                    But American politics played a part. On the American political scene, in July of
                    '51, it was decided by conservative right wing Americans—some of whom were from
                    Nevada and wanted to get Basque sheep herders from Spain—that since we're giving
                    all this aid to the socialist governments in Western Europe, we should also do
                    something for a good Christian country like Spain, which was staunchly
                    anti-communist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The same thing also applied to Ireland, which happily sat
                        out the War, but politics being what they are...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: ...they got good treatment. So it was decided that we would do something
                    for Spain. It was a very limited effort. The first budget in 1951 dollars was
                    the still modest sum, even then, of 50 million dollars. At that time, the US
                    government knew it was going to seek base negotiations, to put B47 bases in
                    Spain. A group was set up called the TESG—the Temporary Economic Survey Group,
                    which consisted of about 10 economists under the leadership of Dr. Sidney
                    Suffrin, from Syracuse University. This was an MSA/ECA project. They were to go
                    to Spain and do a basic study of the Spanish economy. The Spanish economy was
                    really simple enough in 1951 that a group of 10 economists could carry out a
                    National Income Study. The leadership of the Marshall Plan in Paris decided that
                    they would send down, with this group of economists, one officer to be the
                    political advisor to the group and liaison with Marshall Plan headquarters. At
                    that time there was in Paris a fellow named Paul Porter, who had been head of
                    the Marshall Plan mission in Greece. He had been a professor at the University
                    of Wisconsin, if I'm not mistaken. He was the number three in the Marshall Plan
                    headquarters in Paris and he interviewed me for the job. I was impressed by the
                    way in which he conducted the interview. He decided to send me down as political
                    advisor to this group. So I worked in Spain for about four months. All of the
                    fall and early winter...the fall of '51. But I did return to Paris after that
                    mission and left Paris in September of '52.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you went to Madrid, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: No, I went to Madrid, as I said, in August '51, stayed there four
                    months...it was about a four month deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Franco regime in that
                        period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>FLOTT: Again, nothing is as simple as an American liberal education would make
                    you think it might be. The Spanish Fascists were obviously bad, but they were
                    also the product of circumstances. They were also the people running the
                    country. Some of them were less objectionable than others. We wanted to get a
                    base agreement and we got a base agreement. Part of the purpose of the economic
                    study was to reduce to a minimum the inflationary impact of what for the Spanish
                    economy was this very considerable investment that we were going to be putting
                    into Spain. By and large we were successful in that. We worked with some good
                    people. The Spaniards by that time were very anxious to be on our side and to do
                    the right things and, within reason, take our advice—at least listen to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this group mesh with the Embassy? I think Stanton
                        Griffiths was the Ambassador and I was just wondering how they viewed these
                        experts from out of town.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: I met Stanton Griffiths a number of times. We were in the field most of
                    the time. I'm sure he had more revealing conversations with the chief of the
                    group, Dr. Suffrin. I think there was some conflict between the Embassy and the
                    Group, but perhaps nothing more than the usual bureaucratic abrasion. No
                    knock-down, drag-out fights. No major issues divided them. Mild questions of
                    turf, perhaps, over who was supposed to be talking to whom. But all of that was
                    handled with reasonable collegiality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do after you left Madrid and France?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: I came back to the Department. I was put through a course to learn
                    Russian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then your next assignment overseas was to...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: To Tehran...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...where you served from '54 until '56?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: My assignment was made about the time of the August, 1953 coup against the
                    Shah, and when at first Mossadegh prevailed, the thought was that the Russians'
                    influence in Iran would increase. So I was sent there probably because I spoke
                    Russian.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were ready to greet the Russian troops!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: They figured they'll send a guy, who, in case the Russians came in, could
                    deal with them. But then the countercoup took place, most of the pro-Russian
                    elements were thrown out, and there suddenly emerged what could be described as
                    a very promising environment in which to resist Soviet encroachments. The
                    government of the returned Shah worked very closely with us. Junior officers
                    tended to divide their tours. I spent one year in the Economic Section and one
                    year in the Political Section. I tended to deal with anything concerning the
                    Soviet Union, economic, political, or consular.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we feel that the Soviets were involved in the
                        Mossadegh business or were they just taking advantage of it and the
                        aftermath?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: I would say the Soviets took advantage of it, as they would take advantage
                    of anything that served their purposes. I do not think for a minute that Dr.
                    Mossadegh was pro-Soviet. In fact, he did some wonderful anti-Soviet negotiation
                    in the brief time that he was in power. There was an old institution in Iran—the
                    management of the Caspian Sea's caviar product—it was called Iranryba, up on the
                    Caspian Sea. It was on Iranian territory, but in effect it was run by Russians,
                    traditionally, since the Czar's time. It was an anachronism and a niche the
                    Russians had had there for a long time. While Mossadegh was making all of his
                    strident noises about nationalizing oil and throwing out the Anglo-Iranian Oil
                    Company and all, he also went to the Russians, who were courting his favor. He
                    said, “Now look, I'm certain you would agree that there are certain anachronisms
                    that have to be removed. At the same time that we throw out the oil company, I
                    think my position in the world would be much better if we ended this little
                    Soviet caviar concession monopoly on the Caspian”. The Russians, in an
                    opportunistic way, went along with that. So Mossadegh gets credit for throwing
                    the Russians out of the caviar business in Iran! He did have a popular base. He
                    was perhaps incapable of governing. If he had stayed in power, he might have
                    produced disorder that the Russians would have taken advantage of much more
                    dramatically, but they never really got around to it. As you might imagine, we
                    wanted to watch them very closely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that they were messing around in
                        things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: Yes, they were always looking for angles to pursue their interests and
                    confound our politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was, during this time from 1954-56, your impression
                        and those of the people with whom you worked, of the Shah? He'd come back—he
                        had fled—he was pretty young at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: Yes, he was quite young. At that time, the impression of him was that he
                    was a team player; his heart was in the right place; he wanted to modernize and
                    improve the country. The excesses that later became part of the public record
                    and all, were less apparent at that time. We certainly had no major differences
                    with him in 1954. He wanted to defend his country against Soviet encroachments
                    of all kinds—ideological, military, commercial, everything, and so we were
                    natural teammates. I would characterize him at that time as a team player. I had
                    a couple of meetings with him to brief him on the Soviet threat and help prepare
                    him for his first official trip to Moscow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the contacts from our Embassy? Were these able
                        to get out to “the people”— beyond the upper class?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: The American Embassy in Tehran was later accused of failing to have
                    broadly-based contacts. At the time I was there that certainly did not seem to
                    be the case. But the Embassy, after all, was accredited to the government of
                    Iran, and inevitably it dealt with the people in the government to which it was
                    accredited. The Embassy was concerned about former “Tudeh” elements, the former
                    Communist Party of Iran. We were very much against them and tried to keep track
                    of them, but so was the government of Iran. The best way to fight the Tudeh and
                    fight communist incursions was to be cooperative and reasonably loyal team
                    players with the government, which, after all, had the same objective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Selden Chapin was the Ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: Yes. I was very impressed by him. He was a wonderful man. I should say
                    that right at the beginning of my tour Loy Henderson was still there as
                    Ambassador. I served in Paris under him in 1947. He was from Chicago; his wife
                    was a Russian from Lithuania. The Hendersons left a month after I got there. I
                    worked very closely with Selden Chapin. He put me in charge of Soviet matters.
                    His wife had lung cancer, or something pretty debilitating, and spent most of
                    her time in bed. So at six o'clock in the evening, after work, he would have a
                    small staff meeting around her bedside, just so she could know what was going
                    on. There was really no reason not to do it that way. As a result, I spent many
                    pleasant evenings with them talking. He was interested in sharing with her, in a
                    very good way that certainly didn't hurt in any way what the Embassy was doing
                    on various subjects. These informal sessions offered a good way to get the
                    Ambassador's undivided attention on some issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Another example of my work with him—I got to Tehran in January of 1954 and in
                    early August of 1955, Supreme Court Justice, William O. Douglas had been giving
                    some law lectures in New Delhi. It was an annual forum. He had a visa to go to
                    the Soviet Union and he was going to be joined in Tehran by Robert F. Kennedy,
                    who was then a 28 year old lawyer on the Senate Government Relations Committee.
                    Douglas had tried for several months to get a visa for an American interpreter
                    to go with him. He knew he didn't want to be totally dependent on the Soviets
                    for interpretation, both for the credibility of what he did and for getting the
                    straight story. But the Soviets never granted a visa for any such person. But
                    Douglas raised the question with Selden Chapin when he got to Tehran. He asked,
                    “Do you have in your Embassy someone who speaks Russian who could go in with Bob
                    Kennedy and me?” Ambassador Chapin asked me if I'd be willing to do it, and I
                    said, “Yes, I'd be glad to.” So I was so ordered. I would spend a little over a
                    month in the Soviet Union. All of which is written up in Arthur M. Schlesinger's
                    biography of Bob Kennedy—”Robert Kennedy and His Times.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Robert Kennedy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: He was certainly a very committed anti-communist, which was good. He was,
                    of course, younger then than he was later. He could be characterized as a little
                    bit brash, a little bit take-charge; and often unnecessarily offensive to the
                    Russians. Justice Douglas, on the other hand, could learn what he wanted by
                    being less outwardly offensive, even though we were all equally anti-communist.
                    But Bob was a good loyal fellow and I enjoyed my friendship with him, which went
                    on as long as he was alive.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think we might as well move on to Bonn. Or were
                        there any other incidents that happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: No, the high point in a way during my Tehran tour was the trip into the
                    Soviet Union. So I came home, home leave, and was assigned to Bonn in January,
                    1957.</p>

                <p>FLOTT: Yes, Ambassador James B. Conant, but actually Dr. Conant had left Bonn, I
                    believe, just before I got there. There was a Charg� for a while; then David and
                    Evangeline Bruce arrived. I was there two and a half years.</p>

                        at this time. This was twelve years after the War.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: We thought they were doing a lot of good things. They were making a lot of
                    progress. In 1957, there was still a lingering suspicion that the leopard had
                    not completely changed its spots, and that you just can't be too sure. There was
                    that caution. There was great respect for Dr. Adenauer, the Chancellor. But
                    there were still some reservations about the evolution of the German body
                    politic.</p>

                <p>FLOTT: That they might in three hours be in your backyard. In country team staff
                    meetings, the Air Attach� would assure us that if it came to a war with the
                    Russians, we would win it.</p>

                <p>FLOTT: The political officer from Consulate General Frankfurt came up to Bonn

                        about three hours from the Fulda Gap, by tank, to Frankfurt. They did keep
                        wheeling those big atomic canons about the place which made one wonder about

                <p>FLOTT: The Germans were just recreating their army then. My duties in the Embassy
                    in Bonn...again, I had, to a certain extent the Soviet account, which at that
                    point took the form of assisting the Germans in any way we could. The United
                    States was the protective power for Germany in Poland and Czechoslovakia. That
                    was before the Germans had direct diplomatic relations with Poland and
                    Czechoslovakia. I worked with the German Red Cross on family reunification
                    issues; humanitarian issues. I liaised between the German Foreign Office and the
                    American Embassies in Prague and Poland for matters on which we helped
                    them—family unification, etc.. Then, about a year earlier the United States had
                    negotiated a cultural exchange agreement with the Russians. We had negotiated it
                    very sharply to make sure every “t” was crossed and every “i” was dotted. About
                    1958 the Germans were preparing to negotiate a similar agreement with the
                    Russians, and I had instructions to share with the Federal Republic everything
                    we had learned from our earlier negotiations with the Soviets. So I had the
                    pleasant duty of coaching the Germans on how to be appropriately suspicious of
                    the Soviets, and get everything nailed down tightly. They were good pupils!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did we think about East Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: We thought it was an unfortunate situation that could not be changed for
                    the time being. We had an underlying faith that it would not last forever. I
                    doubt if anyone in his right mind would have predicted that it would end as
                    quickly, as completely, and as bloodlessly as it did. That was a pleasant
                    surprise, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: Berlin, of course, was a big issue. One of things I did with Ambassador
                    David Bruce and one of the occasions I had to spend as much time as I did with
                    him was on trips to Berlin. We had an Army railroad train, about six cars, VIP
                    configuration, that was allowed to ride the rails into Berlin. Once a month, to
                    maintain the principle, to keep the right alive and active in practice, Bruce
                    would ride the train up overnight from Bonn to Berlin. He would call on the
                    Soviet Commander, and I would go with him on those calls. Berlin was very
                    important; it was a test of just how far the Soviets were willing to go, and it
                    was a test for us to show our determination. It was a good issue that the
                    Germans were unified about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we see, at that time, any difference between the CDU
                        and the SPD? Obviously Adenauer of the Christian Democratic Union was
                        in.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>FLOTT: Yes. We certainly saw the difference between the CDU/CSU, and the SPD. I
                    would not give us credit for having anticipated the enormous Ostpolitik changes
                    that took place in l970 under Willy Brandt. We regarded the German Socialist
                    Party as essentially a democratic party that was one more European socialist
                    party that we weren't too alarmed about. It was perhaps not quite our choice,
                    our way of doing things, but we would never have accused it of subversion or
                    anything like that. They just had a different approach than the CDU/CSU. We had
                    very collegial relations. I'm sure the American Ambassador would be equally
                    polite to both parties and to their “Fraction”, to their party group people in
                    the parliament. There was a very polite relationship. We had considerable
                    respect for a lot of things they were doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about NATO? Did you see Germany melding well with
                        NATO or was this still a trial period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: There were lots of amusing incidents or differences of very small detail
                    along the way, but the broad sweep of the process was encouraging. The Germans
                    were strictly on our side. They were going to resist any Soviet incursions, but
                    they were also at great pains to avoid looking bellicose or warlike.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know they came up with a uniform that was not very
                        militaristic at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>FLOTT: They did everything: they changed the national anthem; they changed the
                    flag. Do you remember a thing called the EWG? the German initials for the
                    European Defense Community? It was something that almost happened, but didn't
                    quite happen. During the time when that was being budgeted, all the European
                    countries were budgeting what the defense budget would be for a combined
                    European Defense Force. As you might expect, with the product of professionals
                    who were good economists, the costing estimates were very close from all the
                    interested countries, except when it came to the matter of field clothing, of
                    uniforms. The German estimate was about four times what everybody else had put
                    in. When we inquired why was there this unusual wide discrepancy, their answer
                    was that the Germans were equipping them all to fight in Russia with polar,
                    warm, clothing! They weren't going to get caught again like November, 1941.
                    Actually, the European Defense Community at that time did not materialize. The
                    Germans built up their army. They would occasionally argue with us over points
                    of detail—whether our machine guns were any good. Quite late in the game, when
                    the Americans came out with the M-60; it was almost an exact copy of the thing
                    the Germans had been using since 1942; it even looked like it. The Germans would
                    needle us a bit about that, in a friendly, collegial way! In almost every
                    respect, there was a good collegial relation with the Germans, partly because
                    the Germans had no place else to go. There were arguments over what was known as
                    “Stationierung” questions which we at first tried unwisely to describe as
                    “Occupation” costs. They didn't want to regard it as “occupation”; it was
                    “stationing” the troops. There were arguments over how many cartons of
                    cigarettes the PX could sell per American per week. We made reasonable
                    accommodations. What the Americans were left with was certainly a very generous
                    formula, but it did cut into some of the worst, most flagrant black market
                    abuses, which the Germans quite legitimately tried to reduce.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, we move on. You moved to Geneva from 1959 until
                        1962?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: At that time, at first it was a Consulate General in Geneva, it later
                    became the US Mission to the European Office of UN. I was the political officer
                    in this group. Geneva was the venue for many international conferences. I served
                    basically as an advisor to all these visiting American delegations, especially
                    on Soviet matters...perhaps helping a bit with the liaison with the Germans, the
                    French, and other delegations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, could you describe what you would tell these
                        delegations about negotiating techniques, or how the Soviets
                        negotiated?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>FLOTT: Quite frankly, the first time I got into the Geneva business, I was still
                    serving in the Political Section of the Embassy in Bonn in May, 1957. The annual
                    meeting of the ECE in Geneva was coming up—the Economic Commission for Europe, a
                    UN entity. On the American side it tended to have as its head, as chief of
                    delegation, a political appointee who was a good contributor to Eisenhower's
                    victory, but who did not have time enough to become a full time Ambassador. He
                    got the next best thing, which was an appointment as chief of the U.S.
                    delegation to the ECE Plenary. The Embassy in Bonn and the Department asked to
                    have me sent from Bonn down to Geneva, as a member of the delegation, with only
                    one specific duty and that was to make sure the U.S. delegation did not
                    inadvertently recognize the German Democratic Republic. I ended up doing other
                    things and socializing with the Russians, interpreting a little, and helping
                    with drafting. But basically that was it. Also, I had the job of cooperating
                    with the Germans and seeing that the American delegation was helpful to the
                    Germans in any way we legitimately could be. That was generally a successful
                    effort, and after that I was assigned permanently to Geneva to continue doing
                    the same sort of thing with a wide range of visiting U.S. delegations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Soviet style of operating?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: The Soviets, of course, wanted to throw their weight around. They wanted
                    to behave like a great power. They did have certain inferiority complexes which
                    they tried to overcome in a variety of ways. Sometimes by being reasonable;
                    sometimes by being willing to learn, but mostly by throwing their weight around
                    in a very heavy-footed way to show how big and tough they were. They, of course,
                    wanted to exercise leadership in the socialist camp. From the point of view of
                    individual members of the Soviet delegation, they had only one concern and that
                    was to look good at home by being militantly anti-American, anti-Western,
                    anti-capitalist. Very aggressively asserting their leadership in the socialist
                    camp.</p>
                <p>That made them look good at home, which was not only career building but also
                    enhanced their life expectancy, because if they had not done it, their years
                    might have been shortened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was their ever a time when both delegations—the Americans
                        and the Soviets—would get together and agree that “Okay, we'll give our
                        anti-speech and you give yours, and then we'll get down to work”.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: I wouldn't say there was that much agreement, but occasionally references
                    were made when the agendas for meetings were being set. If the Soviets would say
                    that we want to address this problem, we might reply, “Well, if you put this
                    item on the agenda, we will be obliged to reply appropriately.” There were
                    slight exchanges of that sort, but there was no real coordination or
                    co-conspiracy; there was a little bit of reaction occasionally.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they sort of mirror images of each other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: The whole name of the game and the whole product of the exercise was
                    largely posturing and not giving an inch. Our not letting them score any points
                    that we could help, and their not wanting us to score any points they could
                    help. The UN technocrats, the number-crunchers among the UN economists would try
                    and write an objective description of just how bad the economy was in Eastern
                    Europe and Russia. Of course the Russians would object and threaten to have them
                    all fired and all. We would say, do tell us more, because they weren't telling
                    us as much as we would like them to. There was that kind of game. There was no
                    major policy formulation done at the time. There was just a constant, on-going
                    effort, that we did for forty years, of taking their temperature and sizing them
                    up; resisting their encroachments; making it very clear that they weren't going
                    to be allowed to get away with anything. That is basically what we did. In a way
                    it was done successfully. This may all sound rather negative. It was. But I
                    really do not believe we could have done anything more creative or more positive
                    at that time. The Soviets were just not ready to talk. We did not miss any
                    opportunities; there were none.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did other delegations look upon the United States as
                        people to do that sort of thing and maybe go their own way? For example the
                        French.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: Yes, the French wanted to exercise their sovereign and French right to be
                    different and do something different from what we were doing. We listened to
                    them politely and compared notes. The British had benign amusement at what they
                    regarded as the sometimes excessive enthusiasm the Americans brought to their
                    anti-Soviet efforts, but they didn't really dispute that we were on the right
                    side of the issue. They just thought we were excessively militant. We didn't
                    mind being known as that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a professional sitting there dealing with this thing
                        time after time and you had these delegations that would come out and many
                        of the people were authorities, not even authorities, but political
                        appointees, but really pretty naive in this type of world. All of a sudden
                        they would arrive in a difficult negotiating arena. Was this a problem for
                        you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: It could have been a problem, but I must say these political appointees
                    were willing to take advice. They were team players. They knew we and they were
                    trying to do the same thing, in pursuit of the same national-interest
                    objectives. Even at my modest, second secretary level of access to them, any
                    advice I gave to them on how to play the Soviets, I must say, they always
                    accepted it. It was not that my advice was all that remarkable, but they were
                    team players, good people who were willing to acknowledge that a professional in
                    this business probably had some insights.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: Nothing bad, really. There were a few minor, occasional, little protocol
                    flaps. There was one chief of delegation, a very wealthy American from the
                    private sector—lots of money—and the group went over to a casino across the
                    border, to Divonne in France, and this fellow went around handing out the French
                    equivalent of ten dollar bills to all the American wives to play on the tables.
                    His deputy, who was with him and from his corporation, realized that his boss
                    was going a little bit far, so he collected the money discreetly and returned it
                    to his leader. So there were very minor protocol flaps, but basically, these
                    were very public-spirited citizens who were very capable of teamwork, and whose
                    hearts were in the right place. They were trying to do a good job for the U.S.,
                    and usually they succeeded.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: Yes, but most of that time I was in Europe. I was on a roving mission of
                    information, briefing European parliamentary foreign affairs committees and
                    foreign offices on what we were trying to do in the Vietnam peace
                    negotiations—winding down the War; the American position; what we were trying to
                    do, and so forth. That involved trips back and forth between Geneva, Paris, and
                    Saigon, traveling all over Europe briefing, foreign offices and parliamentary
                    foreign affairs committees and the media.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left Vietnam in 1966, about a year before the Tet
                        Offensive, what was your impression at that time about how things were going
                        in Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: I had instinctively, and from everything I had seen while there, deep
                    reservations about the breadth of the popular base of GVN, the government of
                    Vietnam. They did not look like winners to me. I had doubts about what they
                    could carry off. In that scepticism, I suppose I was quite right. The place
                    where I was wrong was in thinking that the massive application of American power
                    on their behalf would carry the day and change the outcome, I didn't appreciate
                    just how difficult it was to nail jelly to a wall as far as shoring them up was
                    concerned. Again, when you are in an embassy that is under attack and
                    occasionally there are casualties and that sort of thing, you don't try to
                    understand the other fellow all that much. I was very gung-ho on the effective
                    prosecution of the war and on trying to find effective ways to defeat the North
                    Vietnamese within the obvious American political constraints.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tet came in January of 1968. What was your impression of
                        Tet as you heard it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: It was immediately clear that the American media and television were
                    playing it up. I learned later that the Tet outcome did have a terrific impact
                    on American opinion and its support for the War. I suspected at the time, and
                    learned later, that militarily the Tet offensive was quite a failure for the
                    North Vietnamese. Some of their best units, and infrastructure and covert
                    assets, they just used up. This remarkable infrastructure which they had managed
                    to build up in the South was all expended; by their standards, very heroically.
                    But they shot their wad without producing any real military results. But clearly
                    it did have a big impact in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you did your trips around Europe, what were some of the
                        reactions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: Basically, I was talking mainly to our friends and allies, or to
                    conservative neutrals, like the Swedes and Norwegians and all. Well, the
                    Norwegians were a NATO power. They all had reservations about whether we were
                    doing the right thing. They didn't question our main point, that we had to
                    resist Communist expansion. That if we abandoned the South Vietnamese, washed
                    our hands of them, where would American credibility be? What indeed would NATO
                    think? How could other countries rely on American guarantees?</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>What would the Soviets think of our guarantees for Berlin if we suddenly let the
                    Vietnamese go down the drain? And these were points with some considerable
                    validity. The Norwegian socialist might question whether we sized up the
                    Communist implications right in Vietnam and question the wisdom of our making
                    the kind of effort we did. They were not hostile, certainly not militantly
                    anti-American. They listened to us. They figured that the Americans are probably
                    wrong, at least on the question of degree, on this issue, but on the other hand,
                    at least their hearts are in the right place and they're doing all this partly
                    for us, as well as themselves. It was that kind of an attitude. I certainly
                    always got polite audiences from the European foreign offices and military and
                    from the conservative parties in the parliaments. The left-wingers in the
                    European parties were quite a bit more strident in their objections. But again,
                    I would not say that they were outright anti-American. On one occasion, when I
                    spoke to a Communist Party-oriented group in Holland, they gave me a reasonably
                    polite reception, probably in order to look more respectable themselves, I
                    suspect. I didn't get anything thrown at me. I talked to quite a wide range of
                    groups. I was regarded by the American side as being persuasive at it, and all
                    the American Embassies I visited scheduled me fully and usefully.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: We knew the elections were coming up and we knew what the different
                    political parties were saying. The line that we were selling was pretty
                    moderate. We weren't saying that this was a wonderful little war and everybody
                    should be more enthusiastic about it. We said that this was a very difficult
                    situation for which there were no quick, easy answers and painting, I think,
                    pretty persuasively, what the consequences of an outright withdrawal or
                    abandonment of Vietnam would have been. We said, “This is what we are trying to
                    negotiate; we think this is a reasonable, minimum position and to serve other
                    greater goods, we have to hang in on it.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: I was actually back in the States the night of the Cambodian incursion. I
                    was making a speech at a small college in Hickory, North Carolina and suddenly
                    had to defend that. Of course, in Hickory, North Carolina, it was easy to defend
                    the incursion on the basis of our using military strength to save American
                    lives. And must you absolutely allow your enemy to have untouched lines of
                    communication?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I must say, I was in Saigon at the time and I was

                <p>FLOTT: I was too! Like most things we did; it did not work out as well as we

                        Service? Were you feeling, that you as a Saigon hand, were out there and
                        there were a lot of people in the Foreign Service, maybe not the Vietnamese
                        hands, who were saying, well, you go speak your piece but this is a real
                        mess we've gotten into.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: I had a certain amount of credibility as an advocate and a spokesman
                    because I had been out there for three years, which gave me credibility. I was
                    regarded as credible on the advocacy side of the thing. In fact, I got a
                    decoration from the Department, the Superior Honor Award, a little pin to wear
                    on my lapel! There were some people who dissented about it, and I had great
                    respect for them, for their having the courage to take a position that was very
                    difficult in a structured body like the Foreign Service. Some people objected to
                    our Vietnam policy, but most of them would be very cautious about doing it
                    publicly. They did it, for the most part, in properly restrained ways and there
                    was nothing in their behavior that I couldn't respect. They knew, by the same
                    token, that I didn't like the War any more than they did, but rather that I was
                    addressing the world-wide consequences of how the Americans handled it and their
                    disengagement from it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: It was good to go out to a post as a Political Counselor. I did not have
                    any previous experience in Indonesia; I did not speak the language. I was really
                    sent for one purpose, which was to help the Indonesian military, the government
                    establishment—to get them to support our efforts in the winding down of the
                    Vietnam War. There was the International Commission of Control and Supervision
                    and there was a job of persuading the Indonesians to participate in this, which
                    simply served American national interests as well as Indonesian and ASEAN
                    interests. We wanted the withdrawal from Vietnam not to be perceived as an
                    American defeat or abandonment, but rather as a broadly based Asian, winding
                    down of things. It was helpful to get the Indonesians involved and because of my
                    credibility on Vietnam, it was felt that I could be helpful in that respect.
                    This effort was successful, and served Indonesian as well as American interests
                    at the time.</p>

                <p>FLOTT: To the Foreign Office. The Assistant Secretary for EA in the Indonesian
                    Foreign Office was a man from “Kopkamtib” the military intelligence part of the
                    Indonesian Army, and he was in charge of national security affairs. I joked with
                    him once that it might seem unusual for somebody with his professional
                    background in security to become head of the East Asian Bureau of the Foreign
                    Office. He replied that in Indonesia, anything that happens in East Asia is
                    regarded as a national security question. I worked with him, and the Indonesians
                    were willing to accept in some significant measure our advocacy about the
                    importance of sending a team to Saigon. They had five hundred people in the
                    ICCS, and sustained some casualties. They did their bit and earned our
                    gratitude.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: The Poles were there and the Hungarians were there, as clearly in favor of
                    the Socialist camp. The Indonesians were there as clearly pro-American,
                    anti-Communist forces. Then, I think the Canadians were accepted as being
                    neutral, from the ICCS days. In our Embassy I handled the Jakarta end of the
                    Indonesian participation in the winding down of the Vietnam War.</p>

                    went to play golf and Saigon fell. I was in Geneva as the Secretary of the U.S.
                    Delegation to the Law of the Sea Conference. It was sort of a chief of staff job

                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>FLOTT: He was very conscious of the right division of labor. Galbraith was a man
                    of great experience on Indonesia. He had been there for several tours. He had
                    been there as a junior officer when Indonesia first got its independence. He and
                    his wife were junior or mid-level officers who taught the Indonesian wives how
                    to go to cocktail parties and how to entertain. As a result, he had friendships
                    that went way back and he commanded great affection and loyalty from the
                    Indonesians. He felt that was what he knew best and he tended to concentrate on
                    that. He also knew that I didn't know much about Indonesia or have any kind of
                    long-term Indonesian relationships. He did know about my European experience and
                    he would delegate to me anything concerning the Soviets, NATO, anything
                    concerning the Latin Americans. What happened was, I went out there as political
                    counselor, as number three in the American mission, but then the DCM had a heart
                    attack, so I spent a lot of my time as Acting DCM, which made me nominally
                    number two in the mission. It was a big mission and a big diplomatic corps.
                    Ambassador Galbraith conveyed to the European and Latin Americans that he rarely
                    accepted invitations from them. He felt it was his job to concentrate on the
                    Indonesians. He spoke the language well and could do that very well. As a
                    result, whenever any Latin American chief of mission entertained, I was
                    inevitably invited. As you know, a more junior person cannot leave a party
                    before the more senior persons do, so typically there would be a lot of Latin
                    American ambassadors sitting around until three in the morning drinking and
                    telling stories, and I, as Acting DCM, had to stay until they started leaving.
                    The only difference was that I had to be working at 8 o'clock in the morning,
                    running a political section or part of an embassy. There was also the question
                    of collegial briefings to our NATO allies, which in terms of our world-wide
                    diplomacy, had to be done. Somebody had to do it; so that job fell to me. The
                    care and feeding of the French, briefing them, keeping them on board with what
                    we were doing, and being collegial and pro-Western Europe. So I did a lot of
                    that kind of briefing. Ambassador Galbraith asked me to handle the relation, if
                    any, with the Soviet Embassy. I spent a lot of time taking their temperature,
                    having a channel to them if we should want a channel. I did not get into purely
                    Indonesian things very much. My deputy, FSO John Monjo, spoke Japanese,
                    Cambodian and pretty good Indonesian, and was up to speed on ASEAN, the
                    Association of South East Asian Nations. He tended to handle all that sort of
                    thing. He later became Ambassador to Indonesia and now he is Ambassador to
                    Pakistan. He is a first rate man. So the division of labor worked out well. No
                    talents were wasted, and everyone did what he could do best.</p>

                        any impact after the failed coup in 1965.?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>FLOTT: The Soviets in the field would never dare to write off anything. They
                    would never miss an opportunity to show their militancy in support of Soviet
                    causes, partially for consumption back home. But I think that they felt that
                    realistically Indonesia was certainly a hostile environment to them. I think
                    they probably thought that because Indonesia was a poor country, with
                    considerable social and economic injustices, that, who knows, maybe in time
                    their day will come. They maintained a presence and access, but they had no
                    illusions of quick, early profits, because a lot of the Communists had been
                    bumped off. The Russians could conveniently blame that, not on the deficiencies
                    of the Communist doctrine or system, but on the ineptitude of their Chinese
                    enemies. They could, with considerable reason, say that the purge of the
                    Communists in Indonesia was the result of the Chinese over reaching some years
                    before. No Soviet was going to get into trouble at home by blaming the Chinese
                    for everything bad, in his conversations with Americans.</p>

                    out. The people who knew the Indonesian thing best probably would have predicted
                    pretty well what the attitude of the Indonesian military would have been. The
                    “Manifest Destiny” aspect, as they saw it, of Timor.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: Very much so. They had a first rate embassy there. In Jakarta, in addition
                    to ourselves, the big players were the Japanese, the Dutch, and the Australians.
                    Ambassador Galbraith used to tell us at country team meetings and at staff
                    meetings that our embassy was clearly the best, the best informed and the most
                    knowledgeable. But that there were, nonetheless, other embassies in special
                    situations that had something to offer. They were, the Japanese on economic
                    matters; the Australians on how they were reacting to the long term Indonesian
                    military equation, and the Dutch, because of the depth of their knowledge of
                    Indonesia and of the access to the older established families, who still spoke
                    Dutch and would often talk freely with the Dutch. If you spoke Dutch, even when
                    I was there in 1972, it was like old money versus new money. There were these
                    brash young men in the military who had learned English at Fort Benning, but the
                    really old established families, who were even something in old colonial days,
                    spoke Dutch and they were quite proud of that. But those three embassies we
                    regarded as being first rate in their niches. We worked with a special warmth
                    and collegiality with the Australians; with the Dutch as well. The Dutch perhaps
                    had more underlying reservations about what we were doing in Vietnam, but they
                    were a very loyal, NATO country. We shared anything we could learn about the
                    Soviets with them, and they, in turn, shared with us what they learned.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: He was a moderately able leader of the country who got into the job
                    because of the fortunes of war, the repression of communism, and the liquidation
                    of the Sukarno legacy. He was cooperative with us, doing things we sought in
                    many respects; obviously pursuing Indonesian interests, not wanting to be too
                    irrevocably in the American camp, vis a vis the Vietnamese because, who knows,
                    the Vietnamese may win and for long term reasons, he had to have access to them.
                    Even we wouldn't have disputed his approach to that. We had good relations with
                    him and cooperation on all the things that really mattered to us.</p>

                <p>FLOTT: I was nominally the Deputy Director of the Office of International

                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: I was out of it before Elliot Richardson took over. I would have really
                    enjoyed working with him. Our Delegation included representatives from Treasury,
                    Commerce, Interior, Defense, State, EPA—everybody was in the act. If I had to
                    say what our most important consideration was, really taking the world as it was
                    then, and the priorities as they were, it would be the free passage of submerged
                    submarines. Innocent passages, submerged, in the narrow seas. The reason for
                    this was that it was very relevant to our always being in a position to fight
                    the Soviet Union and do a good job of it, if the need arose. There was on the
                    Delegation a hearty young Admiral from the Navy Department who kept reminding me
                    of the importance of this. There were a lot of Third World countries who might
                    have said, “Well, our territorial sea has to go from twelve miles out to a
                    hundred miles or something”. We really didn't care all that much who caught what
                    fish where, but we did want to have the right for our submarines to negotiate
                    those waters submerged.</p>

                <p>FLOTT: Underwater mining, no, but underwater collection devices, yes. Picking up
                    the vibrations...sensors. The issue that was formally addressed was innocent
                    passage, submerged. We would argue that any boat could go in its normal mode.
                    The normal mode for a passenger liner was on the surface, and the normal mode
                    for a submarine was submerged. Of course, international law recognizes the
                    importance of “normal mode” and all we were seeking was to allow the submarines
                    to do it in their normal mode, and thus maintain the secrecy of their
                    whereabouts.</p>

                <p>FLOTT: We found that the Third World people were trying to crowd us for as much
                    as they could. Nobody seriously questioned the importance of anything related to
                    the Soviet Union, even then. But they all had their own charters, including the
                    different American members. Lawyers were able to argue indefinitely on all sorts
                    of issues.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: They were trained lawyers and some were very able people. The legal
                    advisor at the Department and Chief of the Delegation was John Stevenson, who
                    had been the managing partner of Sullivan and Cromwell of New York. They were
                    good, first-rate people. Some of them were in it for the very short term, to
                    have access to the revolving door or something. Some of them were extremely
                    able, top of the line, who were doing it for patriotic reasons, like John
                    Stevenson and many others. Some were bureaucrats reflecting a narrowly parochial
                    view, say, of some part of the Bureau of Mines of the Interior Department.</p>

                <p>FLOTT: It would be hard to put a finger on it. I would not say that John
                    Stevenson could hear everybody's arguments and then make a firm ruling. In some
                    cases he did, mainly because he was persuasive and because of his leadership. On
                    some occasions, differences weren't resolved. We agreed to disagree.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>FLOTT: There was a quite important business involvement. Take, for example, the
                    international copper companies. Or the question of deep sea mining for minerals.
                    I wouldn't characterize these business representatives as lobbyists, but rather
                    as industry experts who joined our delegation and assisted it considerably. If
                    they weren't formally accredited as government employees, they came out there
                    and were available as expert references. They were quite interested. For
                    instance, some of the Third World countries, world-wide, probably including
                    Afghanistan, thought anybody who mines copper in the deep sea beds should pay
                    royalties to, among others, Afghanistan. There were environmental things.
                    Obviously you couldn't rinse out your tankers on the high seas. Most people were
                    concerned about the environment. There were lesser things like the extent of
                    damages that might be charged if there was a leak. The Third World countries
                    could think of anything. I think if they could have charged tolls on the tankers
                    that went from the Persian Gulf through the Straits of Malacca on their way to
                    Japan, they probably would have tried to talk us into it. Of course the Japanese
                    would have resisted it. But back to the differences in view points by the many
                    and varied participants in the US delegation, ultimately, any treaty would have
                    to be approved by the Congress, which meant there would be a battle of influence
                    and advocacy with the Congressional committees that dealt with it, which is
                    where the final crunch would have come.</p>

                <p>FLOTT: All the time that I was assigned, nominally, as Deputy Director of the
                    Office of International Conferences. I was actually in Geneva or Paris
                    nine-tenths of the time on one delegation or another. My job was coordinating

                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: No. There had been a Venezuela round, a Caracas round, which I was not a
                    part of, but apparently it was a real shambles of disorganization. I'm told
                    Secretary Kissinger rattled his cage and said that the next time we go out I
                    want you to make sure there is somebody running that who can assure some measure
                    of order and keep it running more smoothly. I don't know if he specifically put
                    me up or somebody else did; however, I was asked to do this and did it for the
                    rather long Geneva round which was four months, and more before we went out and
                    after we came back.</p>

                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: Yes. When I was in the EA bureau, I had occasional contacts with Congress
                    on international narcotics matters. They set up for the first time in Congress a
                    Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control. The Chairman, of course, was a
                    Democrat (from the majority party), Lester Wolf. I had known him from the
                    Vietnam business, when we were on opposite sides of the argument and from other
                    narcotics discussions about which he was interested.</p>
                <p>He had the unusual advantage of having been a high school classmate of Henry
                    Kissinger. He asked Kissinger to have me assigned as Counselor for International
                    Relations to his Select Committee. As you know, the Department can, not always
                    entirely willingly, make people available for that sort of thing. I did that for
                    about a year and a half, helping this Congressional Committee deal with foreign
                    governments and the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of how the State Department was
                        dealing on narcotics matters with the Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: At the highest level, namely Kissinger, it was certainly realized that if
                    the Chairman of the Select Committee asks for assistance, you should give it to
                    him and also, if he asks for somebody ad persona to be assigned, you should
                    probably let him have his way, unless you have not only a better suggestion to
                    make, but one that would prevail, meaning one he would accept. So Kissinger went
                    along with this. The people in the Department dealing with narcotics things
                    would probably have preferred that they be the only State contact with the
                    Select Committee. I'm sure that the Bureau for Narcotics and Dangerous Drugs
                    would have preferred that they be the only contact. So it goes. It's almost like
                    the Law of the Sea Conference in the wide range of people who are involved in
                    narcotics issues—Department of Health, HHS, Department of Justice, State.
                    Everybody gets into the act.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Narcotics weren't that high on the agenda or?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: It was beginning to be pretty high. Even if the State Department had
                    preferred that Chairman Wolf handle his affairs differently, nobody wanted to be
                    in the position of refusing any request for support from a Congressional Select
                    Committee on narcotics matters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we leaning heavily on some countries at the time? Was
                        this a problem for us?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>FLOTT: We were indeed leaning heavily. We were seeking cooperation from some
                    countries. We had some successes and some failures. There was a legitimate place
                    for showing the flag. Chairman Wolf traveled a lot and I went with him on all
                    these trips. We had some success in negotiating and on some occasions his
                    committee was able to be supportive of some things in the Department. We, of
                    course, tried to be supportive of the Department's position when we could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular trouble spots that caused
                        unhappiness in the Congress and the State Department wasn't able to get much
                        cooperation? Any particular countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: Traditionally, a lot of opium came from Turkey and because of the American
                    ethnic politics, the Greeks would always be glad to jump on the Turks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was at the height of the Cyprus crisis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: Yes. You can count on the Greeks to be anti-Turkish and you can count on
                    some politicians to play with that. On the other hand, the Turks got very good
                    marks from the Israelis. They had been very helpful to Israel in many respects,
                    so you could always seek to get AIPAC to be understanding of the Turk's problems
                    and to acknowledge what Turkey was trying to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: AIPAC is the very powerful Jewish lobby?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: It is the powerful American Israel Political Action Committee. Then there
                    were South American phenomena. Mexico was very cooperative on police things,
                    except sometimes the police were corrupt and it was very impolite to point that
                    out. But to some extent you had to, or perhaps some Congressman would point it
                    out, more publicly and less delicately. On the other hand, you didn't want to
                    throw the baby out with the bath. You would not want to disrupt a generally
                    useful working relationship just to catch some corrupt cop.</p>
                <p>Much cocaine came from Bolivia and Colombia. You had to work with these people.
                    Our embassies in these countries didn't want to get too tough with them on
                    narcotics matters, at the risk of damaging overall bilateral relations. But our
                    embassies certainly understood the importance of being responsive to the
                    purposes of the Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it was a balancing act?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: Yes. It was a balancing act; doing the best you could under the
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How effective do you think the driving force of this House
                        Select Committee on the narcotics matter was while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: Congress had great interest in it. It did some good. It was able to
                    mobilize Congress on behalf of the Department's anti-narcotics efforts, and also
                    the DEA. If anyone was slack in the traces, the Select Committee could point
                    this out and they would shape up. It performed a useful role. Anytime I gave the
                    Members advice on how to play a particular thing, they were cooperative and
                    willing to hear what I had to say, which was largely what the Department had to
                    say anyway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of things would this be?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>FLOTT: How best to make pitches to different governments. How to phrase things.
                    Really, one of the charms of working with the Congress...I remember especially
                    one occasion, right after I had gotten there. Chairman Wolf was the Chairman of
                    the Select Committee. He was a Congressman from Long Island. That day, about 8
                    o'clock in the morning, I had learned that the Egyptian Customs Service had just
                    seized a boat that was trying to smuggle narcotics into Egypt. I told Lester
                    Wolf about it at 8:30 in the morning. I told him that he might wish graciously
                    to acknowledge and praise this Egyptian success, by saying a word about what
                    their Customs Service had done. He agreed, and asked me to give him a three
                    paragraph piece on the subject. He said he could go to the Speaker of the House
                    and be the first speaker that morning. I wrote out three paragraphs on how the
                    Egyptians had done this and that we commend their commitment to this effort. I
                    wrote that the Egyptian Customs Service is one of the oldest in the world and
                    have a great tradition of fine work. They did well this time and we hope this
                    cooperation will continue. Wolf made this brief speech when Congress opened in
                    the morning. These well-deserved words of praise of Egypt coming from a Jewish
                    Congressman from Long Island. You can imagine how happy the Egyptian Embassy
                    was. We were doing the right thing by giving credit where credit was due. The
                    Egyptian Ambassador was grateful. We had alerted his Counselor to pay attention
                    to what was going on in Congress that morning. So they were very grateful. It
                    rewarded them—a quick pay-off for doing the right thing. It was a quick
                    extension of our influence. That was all done between 8:30 in the morning and
                    9:00 or 10:00 A.M. Can you imagine what I would have had to go through had I
                    been seated in the Department of State trying to get clearances and
                    concurrences? This is an example of the kinds of things you could do when on
                    detail to the Congress!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You retired about that time didn't you?</hi>

                <p>FLOTT: I was on a delegation to the 32nd UN General Assembly. That was my last
                    assignment. Chairman Wolf was a member of the delegation and I went along,
                    partly on international narcotics matters, but partly on UN administrative
                    matters. I had some insights from the IO experience. We wanted to get more
                    performance out of the UN in support of anti-narcotics matters. One of the ways
                    to do it was to take a gimlet eye view of the overall UN budget and then be
                    persuaded to be more forthcoming if we thought they were doing more on that
                    account. It was after that that I retired.</p>
