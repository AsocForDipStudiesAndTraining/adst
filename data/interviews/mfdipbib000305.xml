                <p>LESLEY DORMAN</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Penne Laingen</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: March 27, 1987</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Penne Laingen on March 27, 1987. I am interviewing
                        Lesley Dorman. Lesley, would you please tell me the posts you have served
                        in, in their chronological order?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: London, England; Cairo, Egypt; Tehran, Iran; Washington, DC, I count as a
                    post; Lusaka, Northern Rhodesia, which became Lusaka, Zambia; Khartoum, Sudan;
                    The National War College, which I also look at as a post, because I worked very
                    hard; Washington, DC; Bangkok, Thailand; and again Washington, DC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which do you consider your most successful or happiest
                        post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, I enjoyed all the posts, but I think that the ones I really enjoyed
                    the best were Egypt and Bangkok. I also enjoyed Lusaka very much. They were all
                    very different and my enjoyments were all very different. I worked a little bit
                    in an eye clinic. I worked for the YWCA. But I had a lot of fun, too. I played
                    tennis twice a day with the Egyptian ladies in the morning and I played mixed
                    doubles in the afternoon with Egyptians and Americans, with other nationals, and
                    I played in the international tournament in Cairo in mixed doubles and in ladies
                    doubles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you win?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Not a thing (laughs), but we got up there in the mixed doubles. I played
                    with a Dutch woman, and we didn't do badly. We didn't get as far as Lew Hoad
                    (Australian tennis player), who was playing in the tournament.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there a lot of Egyptian women who played tennis?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>DORMAN: Quite a lot. A very interesting thing for people today is that I played
                    in one set with Egyptian women and a Viennese woman, a Jewess, who had come out
                    of Vienna in the early part of World War II, and everybody got on so well. The
                    Commodore of the Yacht Club in Cairo in those days was David Addis who was
                    Jewish. A lot of people in the Khan al-Khalili...the mousski (bazaar) were, so
                    when one really thinks about this, Semites get on well together when politics
                    don't interfere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said to me that you had undergone the Zambian
                        Independence. What was that like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: We went into Lusaka in 1963 and Independence was in 1964 a year later.
                    Independence was all prepared for. The Princess Royal (Princess Mary, daughter
                    of King George V, the Countess of Harewood) came out from England and, poor
                    darling, I hope it wasn't the Independence, because I believe she died a month
                    later. She was very gracious. It was a very dramatic time, because not only were
                    there lots of balls and spectacular events in the stadium, but I think seeing
                    the British flag hauled down and the Zambian flag — orange and black and green —
                    put into place was very, very dramatic. At a special hour, when it was dusk. And
                    because the copper belt is part of Zambia, a big car covered in copper came with
                    the President of Zambia riding in it.</p>
                <p>Then, I had the good fortune to have two interesting talks with Golda Meir, who
                    was representing Israel. She was a very serious woman indeed. Her sense of humor
                    came infrequently, but she was fascinating. What I liked about her was that
                    whatever question one asked (and one hoped it would not be frivolous, because
                    she valued her time), it was answered with understanding. I thought she was a
                    very fine human being.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think so, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: I had a good experience there, because I rode with the British General,
                    Sir George Lee, and his wife, Pam, good friends of ours, in their car, because
                    Phil was doing something else at the time, to one of the celebrations. The
                    British officers were all dressed in their uniforms with their swords, and there
                    wasn't any more room in the car. I was slim in those days. We were all in long
                    gloves, very chic and soign�. The aide-de-camp had to stand on the running board
                    of the car! A little vignette. It was the warmest time of the year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a person who grew up in England, did you have any
                        feelings about the independence? Colonialism? We were in Malta when the
                        British left. Lord Mountbatten came out. Nobody can do it the way the
                        British can. Did you have any feelings in your heart?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>DORMAN: I don't think I had any political feelings in my heart, if that's what
                    you mean. I thought that Northern Rhodesia was very stable. Kenneth Kaunda was a
                    very good man. His father was a Presbyterian minister. His mother became a
                    personal friend of mine. They are dead, passed on. I felt this was a time they
                    were ready for it and there was good leadership there. There had been concern,
                    but it was very stable in many ways, yes. Well, at the moment, economically,
                    there are concerns. There are good reasons for that. But Kenneth Kaunda was
                    president. I wasn't too concerned about it, but I think it is always sad, when
                    you are a young girl of whatever nationality and you see a flag like the Union
                    Jack flying bravely in the breeze, and it's been there for many years, and you
                    see it fall down at twilight ... does have some sort of feeling for it,
                    everybody, whether brought up in the United Kingdom or not. Many Americans felt
                    nostalgic, I know. Any flag coming down, one feels this is the end of an era, a
                    passing. The attitude should be “we are going forward, hopefully well.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were no bloodbaths? As in the subcontinent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, there were some concerns in Zambia itself with Alice Linchina.
                    There were some uprisings, one of which she headed. So there were concerns in
                    the local areas where some of my staff lived, so that I did, when Phil was away
                    or when we had a dinner party and had to take people home, I had to take the
                    staff that didn't live on the premises, in the Singer Gazelle, a car, not to be
                    confused with the sewing machine (laughs). This is a part of Foreign Service
                    life, I would suggest, where one has to have courage and fortitude. I used to
                    drop the cook off first, because he lived in the most dangerous township. I
                    dropped him off in his township, then I would drop off the other fellow and keep
                    the car engine running all the time, because it was dangerous and there were
                    fires and all sorts of danger. But, on the whole, I would suggest that I used to
                    go into the bush to get jewelry for a shop that I started there to sell local
                    crafts. It is still going very well. I had rather fun there in Zambia.</p>
                <p>I did a rather foolish thing. I had a (high) altitude problem. I was very tired,
                    with two children. I went to a hotel when I first arrived and immediately went
                    to a meeting at the YWCA. I dozed off a little bit at this meeting and woke up
                    to find that I was fund raising chairman for the YWCA! We put on a big ball,
                    which Kenneth Kaunda attended, and all these crafts. I went into the bush and
                    had jewelry designed — elephant hair, bracelets, etc. — and, through all our
                    fund raising efforts, a YWCA hostel was built. The craft shop is still going
                    strong.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where else did you work for the YWCA?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: I was on the Board of the YWCA in Lusaka. I want to say something about
                    this which I think is very important. When I first went to Lusaka, before
                    independence, it was practically a Board of all non-African women. By the time I
                    left three years later, there were only three of us who were not Africans on the
                    Board.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you made a concerted effort to bring this about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes, we did, but I think the African women — the Zambian women themselves
                    — some of who came from South Africa, were very well educated women. In fact,
                    there are one or two in Washington, DC, that I keep in touch with. They were
                    very enthusiastic and they worked very hard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who bought those crafts that you sold?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: That was many of the Europeans and Americans who came to Zambia from
                    Southern Rhodesia. Those people who came up from South Africa were immediately
                    apprized of the fact that there were marvelous crafts at the YWCA. I had really
                    tried to wean off my work so the African women were able to deal with this
                    themselves. And that is why it's still successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: It's the most important thing!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We tried to do that in Afghanistan, but it didn't work. We
                        realized we would leave a vacuum when we left, but, you know, the thing that
                        closed down our Gift Shop was not that the U.S. Government objected, nor
                        that the Afghan Government objected, but that the American women wanted to
                        be paid for their work.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, I think that's sad when you're trying to start something. If you
                    come out with a job, I'm all for it, but there's a time and place for that. The
                    thing about this shop was that it acquired so many different crafts. Inoge Wina,
                    whose husband was minister of finance at the beginning of the Zambian
                    independence, and who had received some education in the U.S. at the University
                    of California, I believe, and I went around on a craft-buying trip. We got
                    crafts down in Livingston and all over the place. We made arrangements for the
                    trucks to come in periodically with the crafts, with the baskets, with the
                    trays, with the masks, and with all the various things they make there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they also have a cottage industry though? Or were you
                        more or less starting it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>DORMAN: This is exactly what I was doing, and whatever one does in this life, I
                    believe it should be considered teamwork. One may be the power behind the
                    throne, so to speak, but basically, you can't do it on your own. Nothing is ever
                    done alone. Yes, most of the stuff came from actually Barotse province. That is
                    where most of the crafts are made. I have a gorgeous giraffe in my home which I
                    got down in Livingston. It was made from one piece of Mukwe wood by a Barotse.
                    And we had giraffes, too, other giraffes, at the craft shop, lots of wood
                    carving, beautiful, beautiful work, lovely work.</p>
                <p>There was something, though, that I was sorry about. I can understand it, but
                    regretted it. Just before I left, I was asked by the minister of information —
                    because the craft shop had become so successful and because they were building
                    this new airport, which I've never seen, lots of copper, I believe — that there
                    should be a craft shop at the airport. Unfortunately, the women were not eager
                    to do it by themselves unless someone like myself, I assume, would be there in
                    case something went wrong. And I can understand that, but it was a pity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These women were timid, I suppose. They're not used to
                        being administrators?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Some of these women were. They were very administrative conscious,
                    because they were originally from South Africa. Rachel Kalulu, Daphne Kinoso,
                    Pauline Nalumango - most of their husbands were ministers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then why were they afraid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: I don't know. I think it's a responsibility to undertake something
                    new.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a cultural thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: That may be true, a little bit ingrained.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We found they leaned heavily on American and British women
                        in Pakistan and Afghanistan. The women there were a little timid to take
                        responsibility, and I couldn't figure it out, except in their culture, they
                        were a little held down.</hi>

                <p>DORMAN: I think that's true to a point. I agree with you up to a point, but I
                    have to give you some rebuttal, because I was very impressed with people, some
                    like Martha Chileshe, for example, who was the wife of the mayor of Lusaka. She
                    was in the National Council of Women they were trying to formulate, although
                    they asked for input. I was asked for input. We were all very careful not to
                    ever be in the forefront. Sometimes our advice was taken. Perhaps sometimes it
                    wasn't. We never really knew, because it never really started. The National
                    Council was never approved, but Martha went as a sort of Zambian representative
                    to one of these sessions in Nairobi and she was right about the need for those
                    things. And ultimately, they did have one of those things in Zambia, as far as I
                    can recall, in that particular country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously, if it's still working, you did it well. You
                        left it in the hands of these women, but do you think that American women
                        are working with these crafts today?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: No, I think it's done mostly by African women now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's good.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, we planned it that way, we really did. From the outset, nothing was
                    ever done there in a matriarchal way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's patronizing...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: It's awful. I hate it, and I can't work that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were true diplomatic wives (laughs).</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: I don't know about that (laughs). There again, this was a Consulate
                    General when we went in, and Phil was one of them. It became an Embassy while we
                    were there, and we were able to stay there for awhile when the Ambassador came —
                    Robert Good and his wife, Nancy — wonderful human being. He had been on
                    President Kennedy's Task Force for African Affairs. Of course, President Kennedy
                    was assassinated while we were there, so we went to every church service under
                    the sun. It was a very sad time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the blacks react? They were very emotional in
                        Pakistan.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>DORMAN: Oh, yes, terribly emotional. And I always recall that we went to every
                    denomination. I remember at this Jewish synagogue, there was a host of
                    butterflies which came in, and one got under the collar of one of our men. They
                    were all wearing the yarmulkes (Jewish caps). The men were separated from the
                    women. This man didn't know what to do because of this butterfly. There was all
                    this heaving and it was terribly funny, yet we daren't laugh, you know, because
                    it was a serious time. We had a very nice cathedral in Lusaka. Anglican, which
                    is my church, Church of England, Episcopalian. I was really very impressed.</p>
                <p>And then we had gas rationing; petrol here, gas to you and me. And we were riding
                    bicycles. I remember going down to the dentist and having some awful thing done
                    on a tooth and having to bicycle home again. I had just enough gas in the car to
                    get one of the children either to or from school. The streets were very quiet
                    there then. The Africans were just beginning to drive more, but the streets were
                    fairly quiet in the morning. I had my bicycle, and my son, Tim, had his. I would
                    condition reflex him. He was a little fellow to go on the roads, turn right, and
                    eventually I got him so he could go on his bike to school every morning. I went
                    enough behind him in the beginning, and he didn't even know that I was
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it safe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Absolutely safe. And then I picked him up. One has to take a chance in
                    this life. You cannot molly-coddle children, particularly Foreign Service
                    children.</p>
                <p>I remember one night somebody tried to rob us. Unusual, but it did happen. We
                    were at a friend's house and we got a phone call from our son, who was actually
                    at school at Peterhouse in Marandellas, Rhodesia (now Zimbabwe). Peterhouse was
                    run on British School lines, had a British headmaster, and most of the staff
                    were British. He was home for vacation and had gone across the street to some
                    neighbors. He called us from there and said he thought the house was being
                    burglarized. It was quite traumatic, you know, but children have to be adaptable
                    in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they do, and yours have turned our magnificently,
                        Lesley, tell me a little bit about Haile Selassie. When did you meet him and
                        what were the circumstances?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, he came to Zambia on an official tour, and I simply met him really
                    through dinner and the usual business we get involved in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you go to Zambia again?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>DORMAN: We went into Zambia, then Northern Rhodesia, in 1963, to the capital,
                    Lusaka, and we had branch posts too that we had people at ... up in Kitwe and so
                    forth. It became Zambia in 1964, as I mentioned earlier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right. What year did Selassie come?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: I can't remember exactly what year he came. But the thing I remember most
                    about him was that he was very tiny. He was in military uniform, and he had a
                    tiny little dog that just kept leaping around him all the time. Terribly
                    spirited, this little dog. And he obviously loved this little dog very much. He
                    seemed very friendly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving on, you've really had quite a varied experience, I
                        think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: You asked me a question, which I didn't finish answering. And that was,
                    where else was I affiliated with the YWCA? And I didn't complete that. We might
                    as well tie that together. My next experience with the YWCA, if my memory serves
                    me correctly, was in Bangkok, because we didn't have a YWCA in Khartoum. There,
                    I was invited to be on the Board, and I realized that the fund raising, which
                    I've seen ways — I really dislike fund raising intensely — it's rather like an
                    animal, you know — if a person doesn't like an animal (laughs), it always seems
                    to go to that person. I decided that of all the positions there, I was not
                    interested in the very hierarchy parts of the Board. I wanted to do a great deal
                    in Bangkok. Fascinating place. I really felt that this was 1969 and we had come
                    out of the National War College, which I'd like to mention later, and I was very
                    interested in the Y, because it was a very good Y. The fund raising committee
                    had got down to two Thai women, who were delightful, but were becoming rather
                    desperate because no one seemed to want to attach themselves to this endless
                    task. I was like a “lamb to the slaughter” and went in there all guns blazing,
                    metaphorically speaking. I got somebody to represent each country in SE Asia on
                    this fund raising committee, so that Asia was fully represented, including the
                    Thais, and we really did go forward. And as a matter of fact, I received. I
                    don't like to discuss what I've received, but it's rather nice to tell people
                    you got something when you've done something, so I'm going to tell you. I got a
                    special pin from the Prime Minister, Thanom Kittikachorn for my work for this. I
                    was rather pleased about this. That was rather nice. It wasn't the sort of thing
                    you put around your neck on a ribbon, which was sort of disappointing, but it
                    was nice (laughs). And his wife gave me a little glass vial with her name on it,
                    which was rather charming.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you meet Queen Sirikit?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes, I did. I met her several times. And I've even met her here in the
                    U.S., because one of my best friends is a cousin of both the King and
                    Queen...Thanjing Nang. She is a Thanjing, which is a Princess. She is, yes, I
                    believe, the leading Thai here when she is in this country. She is called Her
                    Serene Highness, because Julie Abrams, General Abrams' wife, he was in Vietnam,
                    you recall, and I were asked to read the Thai Kings at the Capitol Center in
                    Maryland, not the big one, but the smaller one, at a Thai celebration. And this
                    friend of mine wanted me to read her great grandfather who was King
                    Chulalongkorn. He was after King Mongkut. She's a very good friend of mine. So
                    that when the Queen was here, I was invited to something by her and met the
                    Queen. Phil also had an audience with the King several times when he was in
                    Bangkok. They're very nice. The present ambassador to the United Nations is M.L.
                    Bhirabhong Kasemsri, and his wife, who is a M.R. Momrajchawong or daughter of a
                    Princess. Their titles go in rather a strange way. They start out as a Khunjing,
                    or daughter of a Prince, and then they go down. In other words, her children do
                    not inherit the M.R. Momrajchawong from her. Then they get other names, but it's
                    not for perpetuity is what I'm saying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of all your posts, would you say Thailand had the most
                        interesting culture to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: It had the most aura of glamor. Although I must say that my time in
                    Cairo, visiting the Valley of the Kings in upper Egypt, was a very fascinating
                    experience. Going into the tombs of Cairo was absolutely fascinating.</p>
                <p>But Bangkok had something apart from a tremendous amount of traffic today, which
                    is regrettable, in my opinion. It has marvelous klongs (canals) and,
                    unfortunately, they're filling many of those in, in order to go forward with
                    progress. There are other problems. Because of the klongs themselves and the
                    water, the old houses are on stilts, and the present, newer houses aren't, and
                    it causes erosion too with the modern houses. So, there are many reasons why
                    they are filling those klongs in, but it's regrettable.</p>
                <p>Our house was a lovely, old house of teak, beautiful, right on a klong, with a
                    lovely garden. The house itself ... I was able to go to Jim Thompson's House of
                    Silk and choose fabrics, not in silk, but in cotton, to furnish the house. And I
                    got very lovely old Thai prints. Charles, who managed the place after Jim
                    Thompson disappeared ... we've all heard that story, I'm sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I haven't (laughs).</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: (laughs) It's not relevant to this, I don't think ... I used to go and
                    get these lovely fabrics, really old, the designs, and make them up, and they
                    were lovely.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you work with crafts in Thailand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: No, I didn't work with crafts in Thailand at all. I was on the Board of
                    the YWCA. I was the second vice president of the International Women's Club. How
                    the Board went was: president and then first vice president, who was a Thai, and
                    then the second vice president, who was usually another national.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And they were Thai Christians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: They were Buddhists. The one thing about the YWCA that a lot of people
                    don't realize — and I didn't until I worked with the Y — is that you don't have
                    to be Christian. There are a lot of Indians in Zambia, for example, and
                    elsewhere, all sorts of different people — Hindus, Brahmins, Sikhs — who belong
                    to the Y.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know, because I had a great uncle who was in China, went
                        there to teach under the auspices of the YMCA in 1910, but I did think that
                        the Chinese, who worked there, had to be Christians.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: No, that is not what I have found. And, in fact, the Thais that I knew in
                    Bangkok were Buddhists, and that's a very interesting religion. I took a course
                    in Buddhism and found it just fascinating. I can understand why people, who
                    don't come from Asia adopt Buddhism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a very happy, ethereal religion.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes, very. It's marvelous. My hairdresser here, who did my hair in
                    Bangkok, is a wonderful human being. And in his salon here in Virginia, he has
                    his Buddhas and they have the fruit for the Buddhas which he changes. He has
                    these beautiful apples. Everything is chosen with precision and care. They're a
                    very gentle people. In the world in which we live today, where there is so much
                    strife, that feeling of gentility is marvelous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely. Tell me about Cairo before you tell me about
                        the evacuation from there. And what years were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: I went into Cairo in November 1953. It was just after King Farouk had
                    gone, and Naguib was in power. He was the transition really, General Naguib. I
                    have a book which was written by him which is very interesting. And then, of
                    course, Gamal Abdel Nasser took over from Naguib.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes, I was there until 1956 when the Middle East War broke out, when
                    there was a big evacuation. Going back, however, I loved Cairo. There was
                    something about it. The streets were smelly, I mean, quite odiferous. But the
                    people are ... I like the Egyptians tremendously. We still have good Egyptian
                    friends. There's something about that place.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Egypt, really, when you asked me how I felt about it, it was really a
                    challenge to me, because it was my first overseas assignment in the Foreign
                    Service. I got married in London. We were there for nearly four years. Phil had
                    been in Moscow first. We weren't married then. It was really my first
                    experience.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were really dunked into it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes, and, you know, I'll tell you something, as far as the Foreign
                    Service is concerned, it was really a most terrifying experience, which I don't
                    associate with Cairo in the sense of putting it onto Cairo. But I remember going
                    into this room with all these officers and their wives at some reception, being
                    kindly done for us, which was kind because we were very low on the totem pole,
                    and there was an “esprit de corps”, but it was just terrifying to me. I had been
                    used to .... my mother was a wonderful human being, who used to race cars ... a
                    wonderful person...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Race cars?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes, as a hobby. And she was a fantastic woman. She was a suffragette,
                    yes, for the woman's vote, and had a graciousness about her. She was charming
                    when she was charming, but if you weren't pleasant, mother could really fix you
                    with an eye. I was used to greeting and meeting people and not being gauche, I
                    hope, but this was terrifying in Cairo. I always feel that when a young, new
                    couple comes to post and even if it's not the first time out, they're pretty
                    new, the best way to start off with them is to have a very small group or small
                    dinner and let them just merge into the environment like a chameleon, slowly,
                    very slowly, you know, because it can be terrifying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a lot of entertaining to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes, we did. We entertained a great deal. And we had one evening which
                    I'm sure has happened to all of us, when we were ourselves going out to dinner.
                    The doorbell rang, and I had a nanny for Mark, who was tiny then, and it was two
                    guests — Egyptians, a husband and a wife — who were really supposed to be coming
                    that day the following week. I realized that anyone can make these mistakes, and
                    I simply had them in for a drink. I was obviously dressed to go somewhere. I'm
                    glad I was ready, because Phil was still in the shower. And eventually, he
                    appeared, and then I quietly and gently said: “I really feel...” And they
                    realized that no one else had come, so they knew. I tried not to say you've come
                    on the wrong night to make it less embarrassing. But, you see, it's all common
                    sense really. And if you've had some form of caring in your own home and good
                    education, one learns this.</p>
                <p>I went to boarding school at ten and a half. The first boarding school I went to
                    had a little house — the school had three houses ... Little House, Middle House,
                    and Senior House — where younger people were cared for rather specially, but it
                    was still away from a marvelous home that I adored, a big home in the country
                    with lots of horses and dogs and lots of fun and games, you know. And private
                    schooling ... it was very traumatic, but it was a great lesson. I really agree
                    with it in many ways. I think I was too young. Ten and a half is a little too
                    young. I would put it more to the age when children go to prep school in the
                    States. It was a good experience. It stood me in wonderful stead for my life in
                    the Foreign Service, because I went to school with foreign nationals, girls from
                    India, from East Africa...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then, in the Foreign Service, you never suffered
                        homesickness. You had done that in boarding school, early on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes, I had. Well, of course, one always suffers homesickness, and even
                    coming to the United States as an American, having lived so much in Europe, in
                    England, one is always homesick for something. One is homesick for cultural
                    mores, which are definitely different. Even Canadians to the U.S. find it
                    difficult, as I know from my present work. And I think this is something a lot
                    of people don't realize. They think that because you speak the same language,
                    we're all alike. That is not true.</p>
                <p>But going back to Cairo. I liked Cairo. I liked going into the bazaar. I knew it
                    backwards and forwards, inside and out. I didn't always like to see tourists
                    come and bargain these people down below .... Bargaining in the Middle East is
                    an accepted practice, in many parts of the world, but there's a limit as to how
                    far one should do this. I liked going to Al Azar. I liked meeting people like
                    Sheik el Bakoury, who was a minister and who brought us marvelous mangoes. And
                    those we were allowed to accept with impunity. I really enjoyed all these
                    wonderfully interesting people. We made marvelous friends and some of our best
                    Egyptian friends actually are now living in Washington, in Bethesda, not too far
                    from you.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, was this a time when Americans were liked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, you know, it wasn't a problem really. I don't think I felt any
                    anti-American feeling the whole time I was there. In a way, when I say that, I
                    didn't notice it either. Now, I might not have felt it partly because of my
                    British background, my ability to speak French, which the Egyptians, educated
                    Egyptians, many of whom did. The fact that to me it wasn't difficult to stand up
                    when people came in the room and to kiss another woman on both cheeks ... it
                    isn't easy for every American to do that. But when one has been raised in
                    Europe, visiting France or other parts of Europe, it becomes an easier thing.
                    It's not as different. I had an advantage there, I think. But I never felt any
                    animosity.</p>
                <p>We had problems. We saw the Russians coming in because they were going to deal
                    with the Aswan area, you know. Even during our evacuation, for example, we
                    didn't really leave until the war was nearly over. Nasser didn't give us
                    permission to be evacuated. In the end, we were allowed to go out. We were ready
                    to be posted anyway. We were packed when the order came for us to leave. And so,
                    we didn't see our stuff leave. That was done after we departed. But we were on
                    the way, and that evacuation was very traumatic because we got into the desert
                    and there was a desert rest house. Normally this was a place where people would
                    go for vacations. We never went. We usually went to the Red Sea. And there were
                    lots of scorpions. We used to take our sleeping bags and sleep overnight, sort
                    of holiday, great fun, very adventuresome, with a whole group of other people.
                    But people went to the rest house and that was fun too. Anyway, we went to the
                    desert rest house. They didn't expect busload after busload of evacuees. Some of
                    us were in our own cars. We were in ours. It was a little English Austin
                    convertible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you going to do with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, it was going to be left in Alexandria to be shipped to our next
                    post, which was Iran. Going home first, but the car wasn't going home. The car
                    was going on to the next post. We were in the desert house overnight, and I
                    remember I shared a bedroom with a woman called Josie Brinkly, who now lives in
                    London. She was American. Her husband was an American educated in Great Britain.
                    His father was a judge in Alexandria, Egypt, man called Jasper Brinton, not
                    Brinkly. Brinton was marvelous and his wife, Mary, was a wonderful human being.
                    This evacuation was very traumatic. We were in this desert rest house and the
                    children had something to eat and drink, but there was nothing for the adults,
                    hardly anything. And the next morning, we set off.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>Nasser had sent outriders with arms to guard us across the desert, and when we
                    got to the outskirts of Alexandria, the Sixth Fleet had sent in the Fort
                    Snelling and the Chilton to take us out. And the Marines were not able to go
                    beyond the port area. They were manning all buildings. As we approached the port
                    area, the crowds — this is where our anti-Americanism comes in, that you were
                    asking me about — the people were on both sides of the car. Nasser's outriders
                    had gone. And there we were with this car. And, of course, Mark could speak some
                    Arabic. He was four or nearly five, because we were there a long time. I said to
                    him, “Don't speak anything, not a word. You look down, don't look out, don't
                    talk to anybody, don't answer whatever anybody says to you, do not respond.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And pray...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes. As the gates of Alexandria harbor opened, I was so thrilled because
                    we just got through. And then, they made us go through Customs. And I remember
                    somebody had a little dog, and the American Marines said: “You can't take that,”
                    this little dachshund. “You must put it down.” He had it in his raincoat. And
                    the owner put it down and said, “Shoot it. I'm not going to let it go in the
                    streets here; just shoot it.” And the Marines couldn't, and it went down in the
                    landing barge with its owner, to go on board the destroyer, and went out. And as
                    we sailed out ... we had until sunset to get out of Alexandria. The British and
                    French, who were fighting, of course, this war with each other as allies, of
                    course, had given us until sunset. There was a big Russian ship behind us in the
                    harbor. It was all very dramatic. We were all dressed, full battle stations, all
                    in life jackets, as we sailed out of Alexandria harbor. And then, we all went to
                    Cyprus and got on the family boat, the General Patch, and then we went to
                    Naples.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how long were you in Naples?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: We were only in Naples a few days, and then we went and safe havened in
                    Rome. And we went straight on, because we were going on home leave anyway, on
                    reassignment. But we had a good friend who was with us who was pregnant, and she
                    was just about to give birth. And she did, in Naples. I lost the most marvelous
                    umbrella, from Swaine, Adeney and Briggs, which is a wonderful shop in
                    Piccadilly, the only decent thing I had taken out with me, because we only had a
                    suitcase with us. I had Mark with me. Of course, little boys always want to go
                    somewhere, and I had put it down in the Red Cross Station in Naples.
                    Disappeared. So, there we were. Lost my umbrella.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were also evacuated from Beirut?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what year was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, we went in the Sudan out of Zambia, to Khartoum in 1967, and in the
                    Spring of 1968, Phil had to go to Tunis to attend a conference there, and there
                    was a lot of meningitis in Khartoum. Tim was young and Mark was in school at St.
                    Stephens in Rome at the time. So, I had Lebanese friends, and I decided to go
                    and visit. We didn't want to impose, so we had a special diplomatic rate at the
                    beautiful Phoenicia Hotel. I had a room where I could use the balcony quite
                    conveniently as a happy laundry without it being seen, and it was really very
                    enjoyable. Our Lebanese friends would send their cars and chauffeurs to pick us
                    up. Took us around, and we had a very good time while we were there. Phil came
                    back from the conference. There had been lots of rumors about war then. Young
                    Winston Churchill was in the hotel then, and I teased him, because the paper he
                    was representing had rather glaring photographs on the front about a possible
                    disturbance. He's now a representative of Parliament. I said, “Why do you want
                    ... Do you really think there's going to be a war?” He said: “Oh, we do this,
                    because it excites and sells the paper,” or some rubbish of that sort. So,
                    anyway, Phil felt because he had to get back immediately, he felt we should stay
                    on in Beirut and have a bit more of a holiday. He had hoped to stay, but he
                    couldn't. I had been invited by Frances Rizk, whose husband, Edward, who at one
                    time had been ambassador to the United Nations for Lebanon - they were Copts.
                    She's American, living in New York and Cannes now. She had invited me to a
                    luncheon in honor of General Odd Bull, United Nations Representative, given for
                    his wife actually. Dwight Porter was ambassador there. Adrian Middleton was DCM,
                    who had been with us in Cairo. Phil had paid a courtesy call during the brief
                    time that he was in Beirut, which was just overnight, and as Phil left the
                    airport, he handed me an envelope which had a power of attorney in it, because
                    Adrian had said: “We don't know what is going to happen. There may be an
                    evacuation.” Adrian had gone out with us in Cairo, and he was very wise.</p>
                <p>I got a call about 7:30 in the morning from Frances Rizk to say that the luncheon
                    was canceled. I thought it was because her children were unwell, but she said,
                    “No, get packed immediately. You're coming to the hills with us, to our house in
                    the mountains.” She said, “War has been declared.” So, I said, “Well, I
                    registered at the consulate, which I'm supposed to do when I go to different
                    countries, just in case, because I am an American 'dependent'.” I hate that
                    word, but it has to be said because it's true, unfortunately. Well, it also has
                    its good points. And I said I'd have to wait until I heard from the Embassy.
                    Adrian did call me, so I couldn't go with Frances. The following day, we were
                    evacuated to Greece where I stayed quite sometime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And where were the children?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>DORMAN: Mark joined me, because he had a vacation from his school inRome. And Tim
                    was with me, because he'd gone to Beirut with me to get away from meningitis and
                    the school holidays had already begun in Khartoum. Don't forget, that's the
                    hottest capital in the world. It was 120 degrees in Khartoum. No humidity or I
                    would have been dead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about the Sudan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: The Sudan is a really very interesting place, I think. It was my least
                    liked post, least favorite post, simply because of the barreness of it, but I
                    loved the people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what years were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: We were there a very brief time. We went in 1967, and in 1968 Phil was
                    recalled. And during that time, we had become an Interest Section of the Royal
                    Netherlands Embassy because of the war. So, Phil was called back to Washington
                    to go to the National War College. We left there in July of the following year.
                    We were in the Sudan a very brief time, but I did a lot there. I mean, I really
                    got an awful lot into it, which I found most worthwhile and rewarding. I got to
                    know the el Mahdi family very well.</p>
                <p>Now, Saddiq el Mahdi, who is the present Prime Minister of the Sudan, is an old
                    friend. I know Saddiq. In fact, his sister, Amina, was a very close friend of
                    mine. He was Prime Minister when we were there. He's Oxford educated. He and I
                    occasionally would have our own talks. I liked his brother, Yechia, very much.
                    One of his brothers, in fact, both of his brothers, are dead. Ahmed died just a
                    short time ago, I was told. But, anyway, their mother was the wife of the
                    posthumous son of the original Mahdi, who fought General Gordon in Khartoum. The
                    years between, yes ... and in the drawing room of their home in Omdurman (You
                    have Khartoum North, Khartoum South, Omdurman, “bas”, that's all, that is it.
                    That's it...”helas”, finish)... in the room was a picture of the Mahdi. The
                    movie, “Khartoum”, had just come out, which of course wasn't permitted to be
                    shown in Khartoum itself. But a lot of the Mahdi family had been in England, and
                    Amina had seen it in London. The picture of the Mahdi looked just like Laurence
                    Olivier looked in the film. And I couldn't ... I was mesmerized. In fact, Sayeda
                    Sakina, who didn't speak any English, did say she'd give me a copy of it
                    (laughs), but I never got it. I never liked to ask. But she was from further
                    South, and her accent was different. There were different idioms and
                    colloquialisms. My Arabic never was the greatest, but I did make a supreme
                    effort. And I thought I was doing rather well until I met Sayeda Sakina. I found
                    that she was absolutely impossible (laughs) to understand. It was an interesting
                    experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>I was a member of the International Woman's Club there, which had two sections.
                    One was a social section and one was for so-called “good works”, but I called it
                    “getting down to the nitty-gritty.” We worked with abandoned babies. They had a
                    red light district in Khartoum, and a lot of the women had come from Ethiopia.
                    Some were Italian in origin. Lots of different backgrounds. They used to keep
                    the girl babies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would they come there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Who knows? Why do they go anywhere? To get money. Well, it was probably
                    quite profitable. The Profession. So, the girl babies were kept apparently, and
                    the boy babies were thrown out. Some of them went into the Nile. And we used to
                    save these children. We were given a special wing in the hospital. That's
                    another story. We took care, and then the staph broke out, which was very
                    dangerous, of course. I was very worried, having a young child there myself, and
                    others, too, who were involved with this. I used to go back home and get into
                    the bathroom, and the “suffragi” (man servant) used to bring a great big bucket
                    of water with Dettol, a British product they had in Khartoum, a British
                    disinfectant, marvelous stuff, because it's so safe, as well as being
                    effective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's like Pinesol. I used it in Karachi the same way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: It was great. And I used to wear my hair very short. It had a fresh
                    smell. It's not an offensive smell ... well, I can do without it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A clean smell?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: A clean smell. And dunk everything, you know, in it, hair and all. My
                    hair was really suffering. I was always having to go to a little friend down the
                    road who had a beauty parlor in her house.</p>
                <p>We did work with these children and we lobbied with the Sudanese Government, some
                    of us, and I was one of the people, (this was before the war broke out) to get a
                    home called the Migoma Home for these abandoned babies. And after we became an
                    Interest Section of the Royal Netherlands Embassy, I then withdrew, because it
                    was undiplomatic for me to have anything to do with the local government. But I
                    got from President Azari a special invitation when the Home was opened to be
                    present, and I was flattered by that. I thought, how awfully nice that he
                    bothered to acknowledge what I had done.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>And while I was there, there was a State visit by President Kenneth Kaunda of
                    Zambia and his wife, Betty Kaunda. She came to see me. By this time, she had
                    acquired a Lady-in-Waiting, which was really quite impressive. They came and had
                    lunch, and she was on a special diet. We had to whiz around and get some special
                    food, but it was marvelous to see her. I was very thrilled that she had looked
                    me up. So that was fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, the women of the Sudan ... are they under the
                        veil?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: No, they wore a “tobe”...were swathed in the same thing as a “chador”. It
                    covers, but the difference is very marked. Most of the women wear it. The older
                    women wear white “chadors”, but the younger women wear all sorts of diaphanous
                    ones. As far as I can recall, the style for women were fairly short dresses when
                    we were there, and so they would have these quite short dresses and these
                    diaphanous “tobes”, which you could see right through. (laughs). You know we
                    laughed with them, not about them. The Sudanese women and we laughed together,
                    because they used to say “We're wearing our tobes”, and I would say, “Yes, I
                    know.” We were very careful, of course, but they were very nice.</p>
                <p>Some of the men, the elder statesmen in the Sudan... (and this is where I must
                    applaud the British. The British left an excellent civil service, I believe,
                    also in India. And they left a first-class one in the Sudan. It's too bad that
                    these things had not been retained) ... the eldest Sudanese, all, had a great
                    respect for the British and they had emulated the best. They had beautiful
                    libraries, one wife, then by Muslim law they were allowed more, a respect for
                    their womenfolk. It was most marked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's why I was asking you. I was under the impression
                        that Sudanese women were considered... within the home at least... the
                        absolute reigning queen bees, and that if their husbands earned money,
                        because the woman had the highest goal in life or mission... having children
                        and running the home... the husband had to bring his money home and give it
                        to her. But she, if she earned any money, could keep it for herself. Does
                        that ring a bell?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Not really. I think the women are very respected. I'll give you examples.
                    I do think they carry quite an influence, but only to a degree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They don't have influence politically or publicly,
                        but...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, I'm talking about...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, in the total concept of their culture, they are
                        considered higher than the men actually?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, I never thought that when I lived in Khartoum. That is not the way
                    the Muslim religion works. Let me explain how some of this works. Our landlord
                    was a marvelous man, Sayad Muhammed Salah el Shengiti, deceased unfortunately.
                    We had this very lovely home, which belonged to him. The Americans rented it
                    from him. He came to pay his respects, if you will, or to greet us, and he said
                    to me, “Do you like animals?” And I said “yes”, and he said, “I'm going to give
                    you a gift, if I may.” He said, “It's not a gift that you can take with you very
                    easily, but it's for the time that you're here.” I said, “Well, thank you very
                    much, Sayed Salah.” He came with a crested crane which is called Abu Gouga. They
                    are marvelous birds. And this crested crane stayed in our garden, and we loved
                    him. He used to screech a lot, but he was great fun and became quite
                    beloved.</p>
                <p>Well, anyway, Phil was giving a stag dinner for someone from Washington. We'd get
                    these very bad “haboobs”, as they call them in the Sudan (In Egypt, they are
                    called “hameems”. There were worse things there in the form of monsoons,
                    floods... dreadful). This dinner party was a stag dinner party which, to show
                    you the particular thinking of this particular man and what he had learned and
                    how we respected him... the guest of honor had overflown. When it was learned by
                    Sayed Mohammed, who was the other guest of honor that night, that the American
                    wasn't coming, because he'd had to overfly, he said, “Why isn't Lesley here? I
                    want Lesley at the table.”</p>
                <p>I was having supper on a tray with a very good friend of mine, Gloria el Fadil,
                    who was married to the brother of Sarah, who was the second wife of the Prime
                    Minister, Saddiq el Mahdi. And Gloria was British. Gloria and I were having
                    dinner on a tray. (She is now Lady Michael Birkett, whose husband is Chairman of
                    the National Theater in London. Gloria had a son by Tahir-Saddiq). Phil said,
                    “Lesley has a friend.” Sayed said, “Please, both come in.” And, of course, he
                    knew Gloria. We both came in and we had to sit on Sayed's right and left and
                    join the conversation. And there were other Sudanese men there, and I'm sure
                    some of them were not terribly pleased about this, but he was very
                    progressive.</p>
                <p>And then there was a poet, who had also been at Oxford, a Sudanese poet, and he
                    used to come round and talk. If Phil was away on a trip, he'd come and talk
                    about various things. I do think they liked women, not just from a sex point of
                    view, but that wouldn't enter into this at all. But I do think they had a real
                    regard and respect for women, because Sayeda Sakina really managed her menage in
                    Omdurman, and those boys, all of them, whether they were the Prime Minister or
                    the flunky, they had to toe the line with her. So from that point of view, I
                    think you are quite correct in your earlier statement.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>But I want to tell you something interesting for history in the Sudan about
                    Muslim thinking, which is very interesting. Saddiq had two wives, which is
                    interesting in the first place, because he'd attended Oxford University. One
                    brother, Yechia, had one wife. He was killed in Geneva, and then his wife
                    married again. Ahmed had more than one wife, so that it seemed to be customary
                    in the household. Saddiq's first wife was Hafia and his second, Sarah. I just
                    loved Hafia and also Sarah, but in a different way. She (Sarah) had been
                    educated in the United States at Sarah Lawrence, I think. When Saddiq went out
                    to dinner where the Americans or foreign nationals might be, he would take Sarah
                    with him, because he felt, although Hafia spoke beautiful English, Sarah was
                    more up to date...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: More cosmopolitan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: More cosmopolitan and could hold her own better in a mixed group. But I
                    used to go visit Hafia, who had her own house. Sarah used to live in the big
                    house with Saddiq and Sayeda Sakina, but Hafia had her own house. And Hafia
                    would say... (there would be a pair of Saddiq's shoes ... and I got to know her
                    well enough that I could ask her certain questions and she was willing to
                    answer) ... she said, “You have to understand, Lesley, we have our alternate
                    nights. And even though Saddiq may be taking Sarah out to dinner someplace, if
                    it's my night, he has to leave her and come back to me. And if he gives me a
                    bracelet, he has to give Sarah a bracelet.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel either one was a favorite? We found this in
                        Pakistan. We had a friend whose first wife lived upcountry in Baluchistan,
                        and his favorite, was the most cosmopolitan and lived in Karachi. Yet, six
                        months of the year, he would go upcountry to be with Farida and six months
                        with Soroya, who was definitely the favorite. Did you feel that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: No, in the Sudan, what they feel in their own hearts is something that we
                    would never know, but their dictum is to be absolutely impartial and to treat
                    each one alike as Hafia gave the example ... if she gets a bracelet, so does
                    Sarah. I think that possibly, because one doesn't really know if he enjoyed
                    going out more with Sarah than Hafia, but I doubt it, that he merely felt that
                    Sarah was more Americanized and, therefore, when he was with people from the
                    United States at a dinner (he wasn't sitting with her after all), it was easier
                    to take her to these dinners. And Hafia, I'm sure, went with him to other
                    places. No, I think there was really fairly strict impartiality. But, of course,
                    we do know about the great building of the Taj Mahal at Agra. That was
                    definitely a favorite, wasn't it? So, that is an example where it does exist
                    indeed. But I think in this case, I would say “no.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, do you want to move on to Iran? That's another Muslim
                        country that you have lived in. What were the years you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>DORMAN: We went from Cairo to Tehran, after having a little bit of leave between
                    in the United States, in between visiting England. We went into Tehran in 1957,
                    April 1957, and I was about three months pregnant when I went in. It was quite
                    tricky going around those “kuchis” ... “kuchis” being side streets, little side
                    roads.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: “Coochis” were nomads in Afghanistan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: “Kuchis” in Iran are little streets, and they weren't paved when I was
                    there. The main roads were paved, but not the “kuchis”. So, we rumbled around in
                    these cars the real estate people took you in ... jitney type vehicles ... to
                    house-hunt. And I was very fortunate. I did eventually find a house which was
                    owned by a very nice brother and sister. She was a dentist who had been trained
                    in the United States.</p>

                    Officer's Club and the riding stables. We moved into this very modern house.
                    There was a mullah next door to us. We had a big wall around us, and there was
                    no other house anywhere near. When we left there were houses all over the place
                    and the “kuchi” was just about to be paved.</p>

                        he took all day searching for it and came back and said: “I think they built

                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, I'm very interested to hear that comment, because our house, which
                    was very modern, was painted white, and then we all had to have these wrought
                    iron grills, beautifully done, because there really was an awful lot of theft.
                    It was turquoise, and the grills were silver. Sounds very ornate, but it wasn't.
                    It was in very good taste. And I had great big pots... lovely flowers in
                    turquoise pots. I'm talking about the old Iran turquoise color, beautiful colors
                    that they had. We had 125 fruit trees and a swimming pool. Our well ran dry, but
                    it didn't matter because we got our water from the Embassy, but we still had to
                    boil it. Of course, we had the gin bottles and whiskey bottles in the bathroom
                    for the brushing of teeth.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>But I was fortunate in that, shortly after arriving there, after the baby came in
                    October, in getting a very nice woman, Osra, excellent, who had worked with
                    Americans and who did speak and understand English very well. She did take care
                    of the baby, because I taught at the British Embassy International School. I was
                    on the Board of Governors, and I taught all subjects. I had a complete class of
                    international children. It was like going into the Ark. I think we had almost
                    two of every nationality. Sometimes, we only had one, but it was tremendously
                    international. It was a very good, British, private system called PNEU, and I
                    don't know what the acronym stands for anymore. I've forgotten, but it was a
                    very good system. All the exam papers had to be sent to the UK for verification,
                    so there was no cheating on the part of the staff there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were hired by the British?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes. They asked me if I would teach there. They were very short of what
                    they called — I wasn't a teacher — I had qualifications, but not for teaching.
                    It's not difficult to teach the equivalent of fourth grade really. I went to
                    help them with French ostensibly when the French teacher's daughter was out with
                    an appendectomy, but I ended up teaching a full class. I had two Americans in
                    the class. I regret to say, they were not the best students. I spent quite a bit
                    of free time after school with them to boost them up, but it was a good way to
                    occupy one's time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Judging from our experience with Iran today, where do you
                        place Iran in your history of postings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: I'll tell you, very frankly, having gone from Egypt to Tehran, really
                    feel that the Iranians were very different from the Egyptian people. I can
                    really say this with impunity that I, although we had superficial friends there,
                    most of the people I did not consider, really, did not think they had very much
                    rapport with foreign nationals, even the educated people. I felt therwas a lack
                    of sincerity among them. I have to say that, because I know very few people who
                    have really kept up with Iranian friends. One meets Iranians out of the country,
                    and they are absolutely delightful. They are nice people. I had a lot of friends
                    when I was there, but it seemed to me to be superficial.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>When Mark went back many years later to work briefly for Bell Copter, he tried to
                    find our house for one thing and never found it, which was most interesting. Of
                    course, he was quite young when we left there. The other thing was that he just
                    felt that the people that we'd known, had been very friendly with us, did not
                    make a concerted effort to be friendly to him. Which I found to be very
                    surprising, because if their children had come to us, I would have bent over
                    backwards to have done everything I could. Very superficial. I felt a lot of the
                    women, for example, my landlord's sister was a delightful woman and I was very
                    fond of her. And sometimes it's difficult to keep up with people. People move,
                    mail gets lost. I loved this woman who worked for us. She sent the children
                    karakul fur hats, and we in turn kept in touch with the people she was working
                    for. She moved to Meshed, and we sent things to her.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you call this superficiality an inhibited quality
                        with foreigners, with Westerners, a sort of holding back a part oyourself,
                        because of this mistrust of the West?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: No, I was talking more of a real superficiality, particularly among the
                    women. Many of our women like to be well dressed. And I love to see people well
                    turned out, looking chic and so on, but these women...</p>
                <p>One woman I knew, her mother had been princess of the old dynasty. Her father was
                    a Frenchman. Shdidn't speak a word of French. Her English was extremely poor.She
                    made no real effort to learn. She seemed to be far more interested in her
                    hairdo, her manicure, her pedicure, and her wardrobe. I have to say this. It was
                    superficial. Her husband, on the contrary, was very different. He was a much
                    more well-rounded human being. He seemed fairly interested in a sensible
                    way.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: No, I don't think they are superficial. The lower echelon are far more
                    dedicated. And whether we agree with their dedication is neither one thing or
                    another. They are truly (and I don't mean the die-hard revolutionaries), but on
                    the whole, the lower echelon are nicer. That was my impression. Personal
                    feeling. I preferred my staff to the people with whom I dined.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think Bruce would agree with you. I think it's
                        interesting that this revolution was partly trying to overthrow that
                        superficial class that looked to the West for clothing, language, whatever
                        they considered to be important.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>DORMAN: It's also, of course, what has happened in every country. At some point
                    or another when there has been a revolution, it's where the hierarchy have
                    indeed not addressed itself to threal needs and concerns. I feel there are many
                    people in this country to this day who need a lot of help, that are overlooked,
                    so we've all got this on our plate. But I do think that in some places like
                    Iran, before the Ayatollah, it was really very bad. It was very serious. There
                    was a haughtiness about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Arrogance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: A very great arrogance, which I thought was most unfortunate. And I felt
                    the problems there could have been averted if the light had been seen to the
                    full more quickly. I do feel that the Queen, the Shah's last wife, did indeed
                    try to address some of these concerns, but unfortunately, it was too late to
                    register.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: I would like to say one thing, if I may, that is one of the lessons that
                    should be clearly learned in the Foreign Service, both by families and employees
                    alike, that you should really “get on with all and get off with none.” You
                    really want to know, basically, if you can, as many people in the country right
                    across the board. To give an example of that, when we were in Cairo, we had a
                    reputation of knowing more Egyptians than anyone else.We knew them from all
                    stratas, and that takes a little bit of work, if I may say so with humility. You
                    want to know the Free Officer Corps of Gamul Abdel Nasser and you want to know
                    the step below and you also want to know the Copts as well as the Muslims and
                    you want to do it with great sincerity. One of the things that I have found to
                    be very regrettable is that I have seen, unfortunately, people go into a country
                    and not play the game awfully well. They're not sincere. The host country
                    peopldo recognize this. They're not stupid. It was particularly true in Africa.
                    If you don't go with a genuine and positive feeling, even though the place or
                    country may not even want you, if you gin with a positive feeling of “I'm going
                    to enjoy this experience,” it may not be the finest thing you've done or the
                    best place you've been, but you can still get a lot out of it and give a lot to
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was interesting, because it leads right into my next
                        question. I want to speak more about the general feelings you have about the
                        Foreign Service and the spouse's role within the Foreign Service. The way
                        you speak, you definitely feel it's a partnership, a diplomatic partnership,
                        is that correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>DORMAN: Oh, yes. I think that it's a partnership, but I do draw the line with too
                    much being discussed with a wife. If the wife is not security cleared as far as
                    the work experience is concerned, it is very difficult for the wife and very
                    often unwise, because inadvertently one may say things that one would not say if
                    one stopped to think about it longer. Nobody wants to be responsible for passing
                    on information which is ill-conceived. Personally, we had an agreement in our
                    menage, our household ... that I just didn't know things. But there were so many
                    other thingwhere the partnership was able to take place well. It wasn't just in
                    entertaining. It was getting together with the host country people and talking
                    about all sorts of things which wasn't anything to do with the work that my
                    husband was involved with.</p>
                <p>I feel that if it isn't a partnership, it's extraordinarily demeaning to a
                    spouse, whether it's a male or female spouse. (Ocourse, we have some male
                    spouses now in the Foreign Service, and they have some at the World Bank. Met
                    one the other day from Brazil, quite young, who was a male spouse). I think it's
                    imperative that there be this good working spirit, because if it's a country
                    where this doesn't exist, it opens new vistas, possibilities, where it could be
                    practical. One doesn't force this on anyone or even suggest it, but if a host
                    country people see you and your husband having this good partnership, people see
                    you and think they may want to emulate it. At least, they respect you for it,
                    even if they don't agree with it. I think they still respect, and it's much
                    easier for the husband and wife both to be able to work together peaceably.
                    Brings for happiness and it's wiser all around, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think the Foreign Service or the State Department
                        shoulrecognize, not necessarily with pay, but recognize it as a
                        partnership?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes, I do. One of the things that Secretary of State Vance tried to do
                    (and I have great respect for Secretary Vance) and Ben Reed, who was Under
                    Secretary for Management during the Carter Administration. For example, after
                    the Family Liaison Office was opened, the Secretary held a reception on the
                    Eighth Floor for those of us that were concerned with this and had worked hard
                    to achieve this end and did indeed present us with framed certificates of
                    appreciation from the State Department. Although I don't have this certificate
                    in any place or prominenlocation, in fact, it's out of sight, it isn't out of
                    mind. I'm very proud of it and I think it's something, because one goes overseas
                    and because one really makes an effort, I think. Most Foreign Service spouses do
                    make an effort. I have seen drones. You are always going to get drones in any
                    society, but most of the people have been hard-working bees, and I really feel
                    that it's a little demoralizing to work that hard and not be able to build up
                    any sort of resume. Even now, it isn't possible really in many countries to get
                    employment. First of all, there isn't reciprocity with many countries and, even
                    if there is reciprocity like we have in the UK, jobs simply aren't there. These
                    people have their own unemployment. You're lucky if you get a little job in
                    photographer shop on the Fulham Road. So, I mean, it's easy to say what should
                    be done, but the realities are so different.</p>

                    foreign countries, I keep constantly in touch with what is happening.</p>

                        more by the 1972 Policy Directive on Spouses? I don't want to get into the
                        formulation of FLO yet, but I want to talk in a general waabout how you see
                        the spouse role today. Were we right to — guess we had no choice — were we
                        right to do away with that role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, I have two minds about the 1972 Directive.Basically, I'm more
                    against it than for it, and I'll tell you why. I am for the freedom for the
                    spouse — very much so — but I think that would have come through a gradual
                    process. It wasn't just being disturbed by the 1972 Directive. There were so
                    many concerns that brought about that Directive, and had not the Directive been
                    put in place, I think these concerns would have been there and they ultimately
                    would have had to be addressed. What that Directive did, it not only made
                    non-persons of the women, it took us off the official roles, which would have
                    given us the opportunity to have said to the Department, “Look, here we are
                    being rated”... and although some of the comments on most of us were very
                    humorous, rather flattering in some cases to the point of being untrue in some
                    cases, those reports were not taken seriously by the officers. Unless somebody
                    was an inebriant, drunk all the time, there were very few adverse reports on
                    anyone. Therefore...</p>

                    shadow and green mascara, because I had green-grey eyes, and this man had
                    noticed this, and that was the first time I had been shown this report.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he saying, in a backhanded way, that it was too
                        much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: No, quite the contrary. It was very flattering and it was couched in a
                    way that it could not have been unflattering. It was in Tehran, and I thought,
                    “Oh, Lord!” It's that sort of thing. I resented that comment to be truthful with
                    you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would not comment on a man in that fashion.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: No. And I also felt it was somewhat... he made comments like this, and
                    some of us did occasionally compare... you know... “what did you get?”, that
                    sort of thing. I do recall asking somebody when I read this. I resented it
                    because I thought it was unprofessional. I felt if we were being reported on, it
                    did not dignify the process. If you're going to do this reporting, do
                    iprofessionally, do it academically. If you're in this report, then report on
                    the spouse as you would the husband; I mean, the wife and husband are together.
                    In those days, it was mostly the mewho were the employees, but I feel very
                    strongly about this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting, Lesley, because there's always this
                        argument brought up that you can't pay spouses if one has soggy hors
                        d'oeuvres. My feeling is like yours, that when we speak of thspouse, it's a
                        broader thing than that. It is not the soggy hors d'oeuvres, it has to do
                        with a people-to-people kind of street diplomacy. When you spoke of knowing
                        your servants in Iran, felt the same thing about it — the relationship — not
                        the relation(laughs) that I had with my corner butcher...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: (laughs) Watch it.</p>

                        the women's club or Maltese diplomatic wives group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: I feel that bringing up the Foreign Service Associates briefly, trying to
                    get this through, were we still being reported on...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: (For clarification), the Foreign Service Associates idea
                        is mainly to do with spouse employment abroad.</hi>

                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>DORMAN: I understand that, but what I'm simply saying is that any form of trying
                    to do anything, if we were still being reported on, we could then show the
                    Department that we were part of the team, an official part of the team. See, you
                    have more clout when you are an official part of the team. The only way to get
                    more done is to have clout. I felt that with the 1972 Directive that simply took
                    it away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not only clout, but you also have to have a sense of
                        purpose...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, yes, of course, you have to.</p>

                        part oit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: I didn't mean clout in the sense of knowing people. I meant having some
                    prestige in that respect.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Entree.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Exactly right. You see, that went. I have to be frank with you. I
                    personally feel, and have felt all along, which is one of the reasons I think
                    the 1972 Directive was never rewritten, I feel too much was made of it. In many
                    posts, for example, Virginia Egan, who I think is a most marvelous Foreign
                    Service spouse, has been an ambassador's wife in her thirties. She was connected
                    with me in the Forum Group, one of the editors of the Forum Report of 1977. She
                    is just a marvelous, well-rounded human being. And Virginia has found that
                    wherever she has been posted that things have gone along extremely well. She's
                    not had these concerns and she's been in some hardship places. It depends a lot
                    on who the hierarchy are, how they behave, how they react to the people they
                    work with or have at post, and the people who are sent to post. We bring in a
                    lot of people today. I think our intake, our choice of personnel, all these
                    things contribute to concerns the Foreign Service may have.</p>
                <p>I've met couples recently. They are bringing in much older people who have been
                    well established in their own fields, as lawyers and in all sorts of fields, and
                    they come in and they are very sophisticated, almost too much so in some cases,
                    because they have already formed themselves into such a groove that to adapt to
                    this new experience is difficult for them. But I've noticed little things.
                    Manners, which are somewhat lacking, which just does not go down in many parts
                    of the world. When in Rome do as the Romans do. You have simply got to behave
                    yourself. And I think...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a good point. I feel we have come through the
                        counter culture years in this country, which was somewhat of a watering down
                        and a leveling of our society. The word “elite” is a bad word coming out of
                        those years. There's a lot of good, too... more democratic behavior, for
                        example. On the other hand, the Foreign Service remains a very rigid,
                        protocol-conscious system. And so, when we spouses, when we go abroad,
                        having thrown out all these rigidities and anachronisms for ourselves, we
                        have to fit into this rigid system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: One should always be oneself. I have always found it to be a fact, when
                    you are watching someone on television and you see someone being very
                    pretentious, and then you see someone very fresh in their approach and good fun
                    with some humor...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, don't you think when you say “be yourself” that
                        sometimes a level of being ourselves has slumped a bit. I'm not always too
                        proud of what we export abroad as being American.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: I was trying to say that earlier on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you speak more to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: I can speak to that, very much so. In Cairo, very regrettably, I was at
                    the Gezira Sport Club, where I played tennis, but not with Egyptian friends. At
                    that point, the Club was really becoming quite a place for Egyptians as well.
                    They had belonged, but now had become more interested in the Club. I was sitting
                    with this very charming Egyptian woman, and some Americans nearby were
                    criticizing Egypt within hearing. That was one instance. Then I was sitting, one
                    day, at the same Club with an American, whose husband was Egyptian, and she's
                    still a very good friend of mine, and she was saying to me, “I don't belong to
                    the American Woman's Club. I simply won't join it. I won't join anything
                    connected to America at all here, because I sit and listen to the women make
                    derogatory remarks about Egypt, and I am married to an Egyptian, and I simply
                    won't tolerate it. It's disgusting.” She said, “It's Egypt. Why should people
                    sit and talk that way? If they want to talk that way in the confines of their
                    own home, that's one thing, provided the servants can't hear (because they all
                    spoke English in those days).” You know, it's very bad. One sees these sorts of
                    things. In the Mousski (bazaar), I saw some of our American tourists dressed in
                    mink at the height of the summer, bargaining down in a shocking fashion. One
                    feels degraded. I remember hiding behind a pillar or something. I hoped I
                    wouldn't be recognized by anybody. It's embarrassing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose it's a price we pay for a free society.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes.</p>

                        “Hoosiers”, and I said to my husband, “Now this, to me, is real Americana
                        and the kind of film that we should send abroad, to show what we are
                        like.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: I think our propaganda has not been good.</p>

                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: No, not really, not at all, and I think it's poor propaganda. It's
                    awfully hard on the Foreign Service, because these concepts are already there
                    from what the people see in the movies and such, and it's a false concept. And
                    we have to live it down if it's not a good one.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, all of this points to the fact that you really give
                        the spouse a big role overseas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes, I do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this aspect of people-to-people diplomacy? It's very
                        important, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: I think it's a great help if people have children overseas where
                    friendships can be made. The husbands may make their contacts in the framework
                    of their work and, at the same time, the spouse can make excellent contacts,
                    genuine ones, excellent ones... when not working... just getting together with
                    other women and children. Children make excellent contacts with each other, and
                    I think this is to be fostered. I would not like to see the Foreign Service
                    become a single Service. think it would be absolutely disastrous. It would be
                    ruinous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you think about the tandem system (where both
                        husband and wife are Foreign Service officers)?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>DORMAN: I don't really see any harm in it. I think it's a difficult system to
                    operate on the part of personnel people in the foreign affairs agencies. Having
                    husband wife at the same post, even if one is in State and the other is in USIA
                    or AID or whatever, this is not an easy matter to accomplish, and indeed we all
                    know cases where people have been in connecting countries. We remember Ellsworth
                    Bunker in Vietnam and Carol Laise in Nepal. That is not a very satisfactory
                    situation for a husband and wife team. But I do feel, however, that bearing in
                    mind that not every spouse is going to be qualified to become a Foreign Service
                    officer, they may not even wish to or even be a member of the Staff Corps
                    (What's wrong with that?). But I do think, because that is not necessarily going
                    to follow, there is no harm in it. And if it does afford employment for
                    thspouse, I'm all for it, because we live in a society today where we have got
                    to cut our cloth to suit the situation, and there's no doubt that the [cost of]
                    education of children today is astronomical. It's appalling.</p>
                <p>The figures are absolutely out of sight. Because most people who go into the
                    Foreign Service want a high standard for their children. And bearing in mind,
                    too, that children are moved from post to post, it's very often essential to
                    send them away to school. Then, that may be partially paid for by the Government
                    or wholly paid for by the Government, but when they come back from being
                    overseas and you're based in the United States, then you have to foot these
                    bills yourself. You certainly have to foot the bills at the higher education
                    level. This has to be thought about in order to pay these bills, because the
                    salaries are not commensurate with the business world. It is essential, really,
                    that the spouse has an opportunity to build up a decent resume and work as much
                    as possible. It's not the best thing for women of small children to go out and
                    work. I don't think it's commendable. I think if one can possibly swing it, at
                    least when the children are two, five or six, the mother really should be
                    there.</p>
                <p>First of all, there isn't the help overseas that there used to be. People don't
                    want to do that type of work anyway in the world really, and it's essential that
                    the children do get a good beginning with their own mother. I feel that if that
                    can be managed, it's a good thing. But employment's essential today, there's no
                    question about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you feel that the kind of work that spouses did abroad
                        under the umbrella of “charity”, everything from working with the blind and
                        doing what I call Peace Corps type of work, to fund raising for the National
                        Trust of a country, do you think that was worthwhile and something that we
                        should be doing?</hi>

                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes, I do. One has to be very careful, however, that the country is
                    receptive to your doing it. Usually, when one gets there and is thinking of
                    starting something, you want to be very careful that this is not going to be
                    looked upon... frowned upon, I would suggest. Yes, I do, because it doesn't
                    matter if you do something in a paid capacity, whatever you're doing, and
                    particularly helping the underprivileged in a country is really important, like
                    the babies in the Sudan. They just would have died. They will get a good future
                    now, hopefully. They were going to be educated under the Government's auspices
                    and have a chance. I think that most of the work, for example, when I worked on
                    a milk run in Lusaka, Zambia, where we went into the bush, and I thought that
                    was very worthwhile to give milk to these babies who were undernourished and
                    needed milk.</p>

                        people want, or they feel unappreciated, or they feel it's beneath them.
                        They are professional women now, and they're not going to do this women's
                        clubby charity bit. I feel that it's dropped off considerably in the Foreign

                    have never been a woman's club person. The fact that I worked so long with the
                    Association of American Foreign Service Women was really the cause. I felt that
                    was something that was worthwhile, because it had a lot of professionalism to
                    it, which we can talk about later, but I am not a club woman. If you notice, I
                    have not belonged to a woman's club anywhere I have lived. The International
                    Woman's Club, I belonged to because I was meeting people of different
                    nationalities and because the things we did were very professional. I don't see
                    any harm with having a cup of coffee with someone. We can go overboard in
                    decrying that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>And I also think that people are wrong in decrying, in generally decrying,
                    volunteer work and charity work. But I do think that some work is not “charity.”
                    It is working in museums where one is being educated. I knew people who worked
                    in various parts of the world who came back and opened the most marvelous craft
                    shops and are making a fortune. It's benefitted them in the long run and has
                    helped their professionalism. I think one has to weigh the pros and cons. I
                    never felt I was being exploited going out in the bush in Zambia. I do want to
                    say that I would like to see more money put toward the disadvantaged in our own
                    country. I personally am getting rather tired knowing that my tax money is going
                    indiscriminately all over the place. I do use the word “indiscriminate”, because
                    to some degree I deem that to be correct. I do feel that charity begins at home.
                    And I can understand certain resentment of our women going abroad when they know
                    that at home they have seen some things going on in our country, in the inner
                    city of Washington, for example, as I have seen. So, I think one has to use
                    common sense and take each thing at its own value.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wanted to ask you about women and working. Did you have
                        any thoughts about spouse employment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, I think spouse employment is very necessary as I said earlier. I
                    think if there isn't employment in many posts, which there isn't, that it's very
                    important that people do something.</p>
                <p>We were talking about charity work (I don't like the word “charity” actually),
                    but work that helps the people, particularly children, if one can do something
                    there. You can do museum work, and when you get home, you can learn an awful lot
                    about the art and artifacts and come back and sell them. There are all sorts of
                    things that can be done and one gains an awful lot.</p>
                <p>The most important thing in my mind is to get to know thpeople of a country,
                    really and truly. If you go into a paid job, you only get to know a limited
                    number of people. If you're freer, you can do all sorts of different things.
                    International Clubs are awfully good overseas, because you get to know a wide
                    vista of people. You get to know people that have been at posts where you've
                    been before, people who are coming from a foreign post that you may be going to.
                    It's also a tremendous scope of friendships and understanding the different
                    cultural mores of a group of people. I think it's very important. A lot of the
                    work that you do can be geared to eventual jobs, but if one can get employment
                    and you already have a career, then if you go to a post... you're a lawyer, for
                    example... I think it's very demoralizing to be unable to carry on your career.
                    And it does not do your career much good to go into a standing situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think it (spouse employment) is definitely going
                        to have an impact on the future of the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: It's inevitable, because of what I said before, because of the
                    astronomical cost of living. Even if you don't have children, you still have
                    tremendous cost of living, and in this country, we have now got to the point
                    where it's very difficult to fulfill those expectations. One needs lots of
                    money.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wanted to also ask you about your years at the National
                        War College. What years were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>DORMAN: 1968 to 1969. I really enjoyed it. I had rather hoped that wouldn't have
                    to do anything, except what I really wanted to do, but Dotty Lightner (Alan
                    Lightner was the Diplomat in Residence at the National War College) got hold of
                    me and asked me if I would co-chair a program that they had then, mainly for the
                    spouses, which was called “World Events.” My co-chair was an awfully nice woman.
                    We got a very good committee organized, and we used to get together in the Club
                    at Fort McNair and got some very good programs. David Ness on Egypt. People from
                    CIA to talk on various things. And they were such good programs that the men
                    wanted to come to listen to them. We in turn were not allowed, as they are now,
                    to listen to the men's programs. There were one or two evening programs that we
                    could do to, but they were very few and far between. I bowled. I belonged to
                    international cooking. I met a lot of marvelous people and, having worked with
                    the military overseas, the attach�s, it was great fun being with them that year.
                    I thought it was wonderful fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a wonder year for everyone concerned. Did you stay
                        home for that and then go overseas again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: We were home just for the one year and, as a matter of fact, we have been
                    living in a house in Virginia and rented an apartment for that year down in the
                    Southwest. Then we went to Bangkok, and when we came back from Thailand, we
                    decided that we really liked that area very much. It was extremely useful. It
                    was close in. We loved the river and had a marvelous view up and down. So,
                    that's where we've been living ever since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right outside the gates of Fort McNair.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes, exactly right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those beautiful boats go by. It was a lovely place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Of course, you were living there, too. It was a lovely place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, is there anything else you can tell me before we get
                        into AAFSW? When you came back from Thailand, you went immediately into work
                        with AAFSW? As Corresponding Secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>DORMAN: As a matter of fact, I didn't do that immediately. I wasn't a member of
                    the Association. As I've said, I'm not a great club woman, but my name was given
                    by somebody to the Nominating Committee. They wanted someone on the Nominating
                    Committee, and I wasn't even a member and I pointed that out. They said, “Well,
                    you can join.” And I said, “I have reservations about being on a Nominating
                    Committee when I've just come back from overseas and I don't know anyone who's
                    here yet. I haven't found my way around yet.” Anyway, they prevailed and
                    persisted, so having had a few names passed by me, I said I would. And then I
                    joined, of course, in order to do this.</p>
                <p>Then the following year, I became Corresponding Secretary. In those days, I was
                    almost a Girl Friday to the President, who was Pidge Leonhart. (Bill Leonhart
                    was then the Diplomat in Residence at the National War College, as it was then
                    called.) I did that for one year and I did a lot of different things... helped
                    the Program Chairman. We seemed to muck in more without too much reservation,
                    which I think was very nice. There was a great rapprochement between us all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, up until then, wasn't AAFSW primarily a social
                        organization? Did some charitable work in the inner city, but it was not
                        into its advocacy role at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: No, it wasn't at that time. I became Membership Chairman for two years
                    after that, worked with Charlotte Rechnagel for one year and then with Mary
                    Buell, who was my immediate predecessor. And then, after Membership Chairman, I
                    have to say, very reluctantly (I was asked three times), I became President. But
                    I did say at that time, although I had no choice about the Board, I did say to
                    the person that called me that I did hope they would think very seriously about
                    the type of Board they were putting together, because I was positive I would
                    only do it if I was allowed to make some sensible changes or try to get those
                    changes effected.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you have in mind? This was before the
                        Directive?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: I had in mind... no, it was after the Directive. I became President in
                    May of 1976, and the Directive came out in 1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, did you have the Directive in mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>DORMAN: Not the Directive as such, no, but the discontent from ambassadors' wives
                    on down. I had too many friends who were discombobulated, who felt they were
                    non-persons. They were neither flesh, fish or fowl within the framework of the
                    embassies. There were so many grumblings. There was discontent with the medical
                    division, discontent with education, which was the overseas schools, but in
                    fact, all forms of education, and of course discontent with employment or the
                    lack of it or the lack of opportunities for it and the lack of concern of the
                    foreign affairs agencies to address themselves to these things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You saw that. You saw there were things when you came in
                        as President, before you were President, and thought they needed working
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Absolutely, thought change was imperative. Absolutely. And as soon as I
                    became President... well, I knew before I became President when I was Membership
                    Chairman, that Ambassador Carol Laise, who was then the Director General, had
                    invited certain people, some of whom had done very little with anything — I
                    don't know how these people were chosen — were invited to some luncheon,
                    including our President of AAFSW. Everything was very nebulous. She had realized
                    that there should be some change.</p>
                <p>Now Hope Meyers had started, sometime before, the Research Committee on Spouses.
                    And during Charlotte Rechnagel's time as President of AAFSW, Hope presented to
                    the Board a document which had been put out in conjunction with the Woman's
                    Action Organization (WAO), but the group that she was associated with had not
                    really been given a name at that time. All the slots of the people that were
                    going to address different concerns were already filled, so AAFSW had absolutely
                    no opportunity for any input or putting any persons into these slots.</p>
                <p>Charlotte Rechnagel and the Board were a little non-plussed by this, so she
                    appointed a Committee which consisted of Margaret Dickman, Peter McClure, Nancy
                    Matthews, Hope herself, and me, yours truly. And we convened at the home of
                    Nancy Matthews to discuss this. We were very objective, I felt, and went into it
                    from all standpoints. We felt that the time was not just quite ripe for this. We
                    weren't awfully happy with the “fait accompli” presentation. Nothing against the
                    people who conceived it, not at all, nothing personal, nothing to do with the
                    Directive. This was a document which Hope presented to our Board. We were not
                    included, any of us. Hope agreed, seemed to agree, with our findings that it had
                    perhaps been too premature.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>Hope was First Vice President of AAFSW when my predecessor, Mary Buell, was
                    President, and she, I think, may have been offered the Presidency, but she
                    declined. She'd been offered some job with a Canadian group and went off to do
                    that. But I attended several meetings at Hope's house, with a group of lots of
                    other people, and we were constantly talking about discussions. I was frankly
                    disappointed that the group had not gone further forward in trying to resolve
                    the various concerns.And that was the one reason that I accepted the Presidency
                    of AAFSW, because I knew it was going to be quite a hard row to hoe. Having
                    accepted the Presidency and having come aboard, I was very fortunate in having a
                    Second Vice President (It was quite a large Board)... an individual by the name
                    of Jean Vance. (I'm not bringing husbands into this because I don't think
                    husbands have anything to do with it. It's a woman's organization, although
                    we've tried to get men into it).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jean Vance is from Minnesota. No wonder she's so good.
                        (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: She's a great human being. I love her. The only good thing I can say for
                    myself is that Jean is still working with me. You know, I can always feel that
                    it says something nice for me, which I say with a great deal of humility, but I
                    feel rather pleased about this.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I asked Jean... I talked to Jean at some length... and to the Board...
                    and I said we really had to do something, the Association. This was a very
                    serious matter. I had tried to get to Ambassador Laise without success. I had
                    met with some...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...which is surprising, because she was one of the first
                        women to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: And she's on my Board of Directors for my business now. But it wasn't her
                    fault. The Director General of the Foreign Service is really involved with a
                    tremendous number of concerns. She had already realized that there was
                    something... things... that needed to be done. She just needed some help in
                    getting it done and formulating it. She needed other people to deal with it and
                    then put it to her, which is what we did, of course.I had lots of conversations
                    with Sue Whitman, who was working at that time for the Director General's
                    Office, and we felt we were not getting anywhere, so we decided to have a big
                    meeting, which we did at the Guy Mason Center, at the big hall there.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>We had a panel. We had already got together our group of people who worked on
                    these various groups. We had a panel all ready and Marie Tobler was the
                    moderator of the panel. She did not do any further work on the Forum
                    specifically, but we had a lot of people coming and going and we did other
                    things afterwards in the organization, which I would like to mention, which I
                    think were very important. We had this meeting for everybody. They didn't have
                    to be members of AAFSW. We had posters around advertising it. We did have
                    somebody there with membership forms if anyone wanted to join AAFSW, but people
                    were not expected to belong or join. We wanted to get this matter resolved. So,
                    everybody spoke her piece at this meeting. It was a very open meeting, everybody
                    was able to say what she thought. People really stood up and discussed
                    everything. Divorce was one problem. I mean, divorce seemed to be on the
                    ascendancy, for some reason. I don't know why. Really very bad.</p>
                <p>So, with all these concerns, we decided the only way to go was to get together,
                    to consolidate what we had already started, which was a Forum group. We did this
                    really... the reason it was called the Forum... because I personally was very
                    concerned about what we might have to do. You don't want to bring an Association
                    down, because you do something with the very best of intentions, but it
                    ricochets. So, the Forum was under the umbrella of the Association, but a
                    separate entity to safeguard the Association.</p>
                <p>We sent out a questionnaire to 9,000 people overseas. Of course, some went to
                    bachelors who would write back and say, “No, sweetie, not interested.” (laughs)
                    People really answered these questions quite well, and from the responses to the
                    questions, we developed the composition of the Forum, which was this: We had a
                    Family Life Study, which was children, climate, languages and all the rest of
                    it. We had the Modern Foreign Service Wife. And interestingly enough, Stephanie
                    Kinney, who was the Chairman of that, had worked with Hope Meyers on the
                    Research Committee on Spouses and called me one day and was having a
                    conversation with me about one thing or another and was saying various things
                    about the Foreign Service. And I said: “Look, why don't you join AAFSW? And from
                    there you can speak your piece and try to effect change.” I said, “Grumbling on
                    the sidelines (she wasn't really grumbling, but, you know, making these comments
                    is useless), so I said, “Now, come on, you come aboard and join.” Some of these
                    people on the Research Committee were not members. What happened was, they all
                    eventually joined AAFSW and merged into the Forum. That's what happened to most
                    of them. Hope didn't. She was a member of AAFSW, but she did not become a part
                    of the Forum, but she was available to talk to and things like that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It really was the beginning of setting AAFSW on the
                        advocacy track, it seems to me, or a more professional way of going about
                        things, and I think, Lesley, you were really instrumental in bringing that
                        about.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, I did my best. As well as that Modern Foreign Service Wife
                    Committee that Stephanie chaired (and I'll give you the names of the people who
                    worked with us), there was Orientation and Training, which, of course, is a very
                    important one; Reentry, which has always caused severe stress. I mean, I think
                    reentry is one of the things that is frightfully difficult for everybody. I
                    don't know about you, but I've stood and looked at beds and been unable to make
                    them, which I'm ashamed to confess (laughs). It's one of the most appalling
                    examples of stress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I thought it was always fun to have twelve servants
                        overseas, being in a complete household of men... with a husband, three
                        sons, and maybe seven male servants... and then come home and be all
                        servants rolled into one. And you're trying to get your kids to make their
                        beds. It's not easy, is it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: It's not easy. I think that servants actually are a blessing, but
                    sometimes often a difficulty, because they often have to be trained almost from
                    scratch. I know that in Tehran, for example, I pulled aboard the husband of the
                    woman I had. He had a cobbler shop and lost it, and she trained him, and he came
                    to work with us. Phil gave him a white dinner jacket. I found him tying Mark's
                    shoelaces, you know, that sort of thing. I think one of the reasons I liked
                    Bangkok so much was because I had the most marvelous staff there. I had a cook
                    and two maids. They didn't speak much English, but the cook did. And I had a
                    perfectly wonderful chauffeur, who spoke perfect English, and a gardener who
                    didn't speak any, but the thing was they were all good. There are other places
                    where that quantity is not easy to work with, but this was a pleasure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you're quite right about reentry being a
                        difficulty, because it is a sort of “Upstairs, Downstairs” life.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: (laughs) More downstairs, than upstairs, I would suggest.</p>
                <p>Then we had Women in Transition, Retirement and Divorce, which we'll go into, of
                    course, and the Spouses Talent Skills Bank, which was put together by Cynthia
                    Chard and taken over by the Department of State from Cynthia. And we also
                    ultimately had eight recommendations in the final report, eight full
                    recommendations. Our concerns, having written this report, I'll mention some of
                    these concerns. We felt that by writing it, it would put on record what was
                    happening, and not only that, by presenting it to the top echelon in State,
                    USIA, and AID, it was almost politely forcing the hand.</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>Now, the first person we went to see was the Director General and that was
                    Ambassador Carol Laise. She was extremely nice. May I say that we exercised
                    caution at every turn. We did everything most professionally. We always had a
                    member of the particular labor union... in the case of the Director General, it
                    was the American Foreign Service Association (AFSA). They are the labor union
                    for State. In fact, there was a labor union for AID and USIA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: AAFSW is not a labor union.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Absolutely not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a lobbying group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, we got it into lobbying in order to do that, and indeed we did pay
                    our dues to do that, but...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there is a difference.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Exactly so. And the AFGE is the USIA union. They took over from AFSA in
                    the United States. But we were responsible for seeing that when we met different
                    people that the labor organization was there. We covered our tracks from stem to
                    stern.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's very interesting, for when you think of it, the
                        1972 Directive, in effect, legally excised spouses from the State Department
                        in a way as a policy, and a lot of women were fighting for this independence
                        from the Foreign Service. So, here we come along with some of our feelings
                        about spouses in the Foreign Service and are presenting them to the Director
                        General, but we really don't have a union behind us or anything. I feel this
                        was the juncture at which AAFSW had to establish its “bona fides”, you might
                        say...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, the great thing about AAFSW, in my opinion, therein lies its
                    strength, because it is a non-profit, autonomous organization. It is nothing to
                    do with the Foreign Service. Its members are, but it is not. And I think that is
                    the secret and that is why we have a lot of clout. You know, if we're denied the
                    Eighth Floor for any reason, the diplomatic reception rooms, immediately
                    somebody from the Hill comes down quickly to the Secretary of State and says:
                    “Why is the Association being treated this way?” We have a very sound reputation
                    now on the Hill, which, of course, came about partly from this work that I'm
                    going to recount to you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's get on with the Forum Report then.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>DORMAN: The meeting with the Director General is where we are at now. W(I
                    believe... the Forum Group), I always took the Group with me. May I mention this
                    here and now: the Group did change along the road. Jean Vance remained in place;
                    I remained in place. But it did change, because obviously people were posted,
                    and so, I will mention shortly who the Group were initially, who were the
                    Steering Committee, the initial people.</p>
                <p>While we were with Ambassador Laise, having presented a copy of the Forum Report
                    to the Secretary of State, then Henry Kissinger, to various people, such as
                    Larry Eagleburger, who was in the Department at the time, and to the Director of
                    USIA just coming aboard, John Rinehart, and to the Director of AID, Governor
                    Gilligan. So, they had copies of our Forum Report.</p>
                <p>Now, when you have an association like the Association of American Foreign
                    Service Women, one has to watch its budget, because most of our money does go to
                    good works in the inner city, which we'll discuss presently, and therefore, I
                    asked Ambassador Laise whether she would be willing for the Department to send
                    copies of the Forum Report to posts or get them reproduced at post, if they
                    could do that, and with a mandatory telegram requesting that meetings be held at
                    post to discuss the Forum Report, which hopefully everyone had been given an
                    opportunity to read.</p>
                <p>And the reason I requested this was because we had got our findings, and that's
                    why we had been able to write the report. But I felt it was very necessary, as
                    indeed did the Forum Group, to substantiate these findings, because we wanted to
                    get as much backing as possible, to go ahead and get the office opened, which we
                    will be discussing and which we felt to be all important.</p>
                <p>So, Ambassador Laise agreed to this, and the Forum Report did go out. It went out
                    with a cable, of course, signed by the Secretary of State. In the interim, after
                    the report went out, we made arrangements to see the then Deputy Under Secretary
                    of State for Management, which was what it was called then, who was Richard
                    Moose. Now, he wasn't aboard very long and he was replaced by Benjamin Reed, who
                    did most of the work with us and who very shortly after getting into the role,
                    into the office, became the Under Secretary for Management, which it is now
                    called.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>After seeing Ben, we went to see Secretary of State Vance, (the Democrats then
                    being in office). I talked to Gay Vance, Mrs. Vance, and apprized her of what we
                    were doing, because she had agreed to be our Honorary President, and which I
                    felt it was customary for the wife of the Secretary of State as a role for her
                    to play. Gay Vance is a woman who sits on many interesting boards, but doesn't
                    just sit on the board. She's a very interesting, active woman, and I felt that
                    she really was concerned herself, had genuine concerns. We had a lengthy meeting
                    with Secretary Vance. Mrs. Vance was present at our invitation. The Director
                    General was present and the main members of the Forum Committee. The Secretary
                    agreed that what we were thinking about was a very wise plan.</p>
                <p>We had explained to him the tremendous concerns which existed and that, if you
                    allow these rumbles to continue, they merely escalate and result in much more
                    serious affairs. What had prompted me, had really given me food for grave
                    concern, was that the Canadian ambassadors' wives had indeed mutinied. Now, it's
                    easier for them to do it than for our wives, because they are a much smaller
                    service. This is not something that one wants to discuss all over the place,
                    because after all the Canadians are our sisters, but it was very disquieting to
                    me and it was factual. I felt that after having that big meeting, these concerns
                    were very real. We were hearing them from everywhere. And they were so varied
                    that it was necessary. The emphasis was all on most things that occurred within
                    the framework of being a Foreign Service spouse!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was always interesting to me, Lesley, when you
                        mentioned the Canadian women, how their concerns paralleled ours in many
                        respects.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Absolutely. Absolutely. And I think that this was basically ... although
                    they (the Canadians) find it quite difficult coming to Washington, because of
                    all sorts of insurance concerns and medical concerns, living insurance, which
                    make it rather difficult for them. But we always assume incidentally, Penne,
                    that because we speak the same language that things are not difficult. This is
                    something that is a very good example, the Canadians, that they do find it quite
                    difficult getting integrated here. That's something to bear in mind. It must be
                    much harder for other people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's surprising.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: It is surprising, but English people find it difficult too. It's
                    expectations. One expects things, because the language is the same, to be easy.
                    What, to us, may be easy to other people getting used to, is not. But the
                    Canadians, I would have thought, would not have had the same trouble, because
                    they are so close and have so many of the same things.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>The responses coming from sending these reports abroad were very positive.
                    Everyone in the foreign affairs agencies was extremely supportive in what we
                    were trying to do. It was agreed that there should be an office. We had really
                    wanted it to be called Community Liaison Office, mainly because of concerns that
                    we felt might arise from the Staff Corps side of things. Family Liaison Office
                    is what the Department wanted. I had joined WAO (Women's Action Organization)
                    and also September Seventeen, which was the Staff Corps Group, because the Staff
                    Corps felt that wives were getting jobs overseas under certain aegis, at certain
                    posts, which normally the Staff Corps could get (e.g. Excursion Tours).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It threatened them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Exactly right. They did view the wives as a threat. Once the Family
                    Liaison Office was established, we were able to deal with this very effectively
                    and to give conclusive proof that we had not encroached on the Staff Corps
                    preserves in any way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find such proof?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, Susan McClintock... it's a little early to talk about it, because
                    we haven't got onto the Skills Bank yet... but Susan McClintock was in charge of
                    the Skills Talent Bank, which the Department agreed to computerize, which was
                    part of the FLO once it was established. I requested a meeting with the
                    September Seventeen group leadership and their members or whoever wished to
                    attend. I had Susan with me and she was able to give conclusive proof that there
                    had been no jobs taken which would have been Excursion Tours taken by wives,
                    which should have been for Staff Corps members. And that was really very
                    important.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After this report was disseminated, then what was the next
                        step?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: We went through various procedures to do that, to establish FLO. Jean
                    Vance and I had a number of meetings with Joan Clark, who as you recall
                    subsequently went as Ambassador to Malta and preceded you there, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She succeeded Bruce.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, anyway, Joan Clark and her sidekick... a Phyllis Bucsko, a very
                    bright woman, who were with Management, we had a lot of negotiations with both
                    of them. And we also went to see Ben Reed. We went to see the Director of AID,
                    Governor Gilligan, and had a long session with him, because we had a grievance,
                    and our grievance was that when we had sent out the questionnaires, (I had been
                    able to get the names and addresses of the people we should send them to in AID,
                    State, and USIA with all sorts of promises dealing with these things), and an
                    awful lot of the AID people's addresses were out odate.And Governor Gilligan
                    agreed it was quite monstrous to the proportion that it existed. He was very
                    cooperative on all our ideas, on the various concerns that we had on education,
                    medical, and divorce, the children and the employment and the rest of it.</p>
                <p>Then, we went to see John Rinehart, who had just come aboard as Director at USIA,
                    and, of course, we had AFGE there for that, because AFGE was the labor union for
                    them, and they were all very responsive, really, very responsive indeed. They
                    all had their own team with them, one or two people and so forth.</p>
                <p>And then I briefed the Secretary of State, again with his full team, and that was
                    (laughs) quite a terrifying experience. Apparently, there was quite a lot of
                    briefing on that day, and I learned afterwards that there was a competition as
                    to who did the best, and I'm saying this without any real modesty, but
                    apparently I won (laughs). I was quite terrified. I always remember the
                    Secretary saying to me... I had a brief with me, and he said, “Are you going to
                    read that or do you want to extemporize or pull out the pieces you want.” “No,”
                    I said, “I'm going to read it. It's fairly short, Mr. Secretary, and then I will
                    speak to the various points.” And it worked. It went very well.</p>
                <p>If you don't read from your brief under those circumstances, you can be tempted
                    to leave things out which are frightfully important. And I owed it to all the
                    work we'd done to do my best. And we really got 100 percent support; I can
                    really say that. It was absolutely fantastic.And from there, after meeting with
                    all these people, we then chose the office space. We chose it. I want to say
                    here that any organization that is in any way dealing in a negotiating style
                    should never relinquish that negotiating ability and opportunity until the
                    ribbon is cut, until the office is opened, because once you let the reins go,
                    it's a serious business.</p>
                <p>And then, Jean Vance and I sat on a panel to choose the Director of FLO. We sat
                    with one of the top people in Personnel, and there was an Assistant Secretary
                    who was in charge of our panel, and we simply worked from dawn to dusk. Jean and
                    I were there at 8:30 AM and we never moved from the room until 1:30 PM. How we
                    did it, I don't know. And then we went on until closing time. It was a really
                    very exhausting process. We got hundreds of resumes and got it down to ten
                    people. We interviewed ten. It was right across the board. It was people from
                    the outside. Somebody had been a child movie star in some film. They were really
                    from everywhere. And then we got down to five.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>And at five, Jean wasn't on the final panel, which I was sorry about, but I did
                    discover that USIA and AID weren't going to be on the panel and I did point this
                    out to Ben, and he agreed. I said, “There may be funding, you know. They are
                    part of the foreign affairs community.” So, anyway, they came aboard. They got
                    somebody quite high up in USIA and AID. There was Harry Barnes, who'd taken over
                    from Carol Laise as Director General, Joan Clark, Ben Reed and myself. And we
                    didn't have any prepared questions. They just came out as we thought fit. We
                    probably proposed different questions to different people, but that's fair too.
                    It was all covering the concerns. And Janet Lloyd was chosen as the first
                    Director of FLO.</p>
                <p>And there was another panel and resumes and things, and Mette Beecroft was chosen
                    by the initial panel for Deputy Director. And Susan McClintock was chosen for
                    the Skills Talent Bank. Joan Scott, who had been Nathaniel Davis' secretary,
                    came in from Bern, and I told Janet Lloyd about her, because Liz Davis thought
                    she would be awfully good for the office. Bernice Munsey came in as the
                    Education Counselor, which completed the staff at that time. She had been the
                    Director of the Foreign Service Education Counseling Center, which AAFSW ran
                    with AFSA, and we decided for various reasons to bring that to a close. I tried
                    to persuade the AAFSW Board to start a counseling center for AAFSW, and the
                    Board wouldn't go along with it. Bernice had even found offices for it near the
                    White House with a shuttle going from every agency to the office, and we hoped
                    also to have an employment agency later on. We would have made nothing but
                    profit, but the Board was timid. And I do mention that because it annoyed me, no
                    end.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Board was what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Timid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Timid.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: They were worried about the finances, and the only amount we could have
                    lost (and we went through this with a fine-toothed comb with expert advice)
                    would have been $6,000. And believe you me, we would have made a tremendous
                    amount of money.</p>
                <p>It would have helped us to have perhaps eventually done away with the Bookfair,
                    which has always been a millstone around our necks, but a necessary one. I was
                    sorry, because it was a decent idea. And Bernice had already got clientele from
                    foreign embassies, from the World Bank, INS, and we would have had a ball with
                    it. Anyway, bearing in mind that it was necessary to put somebody in there (in
                    FLO), I talked to Ann Mathias, Senator Mathias' wife, who's always been
                    interested in education...</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know why, don't you? Because she had a learning
                        disability growing up. Did you know that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: No, I didn't know that. She may have mentioned it to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Therefore, she's always been interested in education.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: She's just a darling. I introduced her to Janet Lloyd, and Janet took it
                    over from there. The Secretary was called to the Hill and funding was brought
                    about to have this counseling put into FLO. It had to go somewhere, and I was so
                    pleased. Now, of course, the FLO is expanded. Well, anyway, we're going a bit
                    ahead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It took one year to get it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes, and Secretary Vance gave a marvelous party upstairs for all of us
                    and gave us all certificates of appreciation which were framed (I always mention
                    that they were framed, because frames are so expensive. Otherwise, mine would
                    remain furled for life! Well, I won't say what I would have done with it
                    probably. (laughs)) It was a very nice party. Philip Habib came, made an effort.
                    Everybody was there. I made a speech. The Secretary made a speech, or vice
                    versa, I would suggest, and it was all really... And the head of AFSA also made
                    a speech. We really felt that we had achieved something.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: We also asked that M/FLO be under the highest echelon of Management,
                    because we knew it would have a problem within the Department getting started.
                    We also knew that... they gave us, through Ben Reed, I think, that sign which
                    assistant secretaries usually have above their doors, above their offices. We
                    had originally asked that the grades be a four and five, and they ended up a
                    three and a five. And I, with a great deal of daring, went to Ben and asked him
                    if the Deputy couldn't be raised to a four, because I felt that the Deputy had
                    to know as much as the Director, particularly in the opening of an office like
                    this. But he'd gone as far as he could and he just felt he couldn't go any
                    further.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>I think it would be good to record the various concerns of the Forum Report. Of
                    course, it was extensive. I'm just giving you the sort of headings: Education
                    and Adjustment of Children. There have been a lot of problems with the various
                    schools overseas, DOA, and various problems. Medical. (The Forum Group had six
                    hours with Med, not altogether, separate hours, with the Medical Staff then.
                    There was Dr. Watson, who was head of the Medical Division, Dr. Dustin, who was
                    the Deputy and is now the Director, and Jerry Rose, who was Administrative
                    Assistant, and Dr. Hanes, who was the Psychiatrist).We just absolutely got
                    together. They couldn't have been more cooperative. And I think one of the
                    reasons that there have been problems with MED since, it seems to be on a
                    continuing basis as far as I can see, is because people change, and I think that
                    some people come in and disrupt and so on.</p>
                <p>Well, to go on with this: Living Conditions. (Housing obviously comes under
                    that). Career Continuity. (There's your Career Employment). Communication with
                    the Foreign Affairs Agencies. (Often abysmal). Reentry. (Again, a very important
                    entity). Transition from Foreign Service Life, (which, of course, includes to
                    the private sector or retirement. That is very traumatic. I think that
                    retirement business is very traumatic. The men have always been away from home.
                    Now they are always in the home. I've seen more and more cases of the wives
                    going out and doing something. It doesn't matter whether they are cleaning out a
                    stable someplace, they are doing something in order to get out, because the
                    husbands are home. I think it's a very difficult situation. It's something that
                    I know is very difficult, and I've known a lot of people who have had problems
                    with it). Tax Free Retirement Account in Spouse's Name. (That's the Tax Reform
                    of 1976, which of course, came out at the time we were involved writing this).
                    Education and Family Counseling. The Divorced Spouse. Teenagers.</p>
                <p>I want to put on record what was in the program when thM/FLO was opened: “The FLO
                    (That's M for Management and FLO for Family Liaison Office) is a two-way channel
                    of communication for the foreign affairs community, a central clearing house, a
                    resource center and a referral service. It provides information related to
                    Foreign Service living to employees and family members in Washington and abroad.
                    It communicates the individual and collective concerns of families to the
                    foreign affairs agencies.” And, of course, we know now that there are little
                    CLOs (Community Liaison Offices), which are little FLOs in many posts around the
                    world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many are there today? Over 100 isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>DORMAN: I don't know. I think there are quite a lot. I think there are very few
                    posts without them, where they can be had. The problem with them, I think, is
                    that often the person who does training, if the budget isn't too good at any
                    particular time... the FLO Director or whomsoever goes out... goes out to train
                    them... I think some of these people may be missed. And if they don't report to
                    Washington, which they don't have to, (they get medicals in the field now and
                    all sorts of things), then it means that they're not meeting with other CLOs. I
                    think that is gradually being addressed. This is a great concern to me, because
                    I think that I've heard too many stories. There are many marvelous stories of
                    what is going on in the field with CLOs, but we do have to
                    address...unfortunately, we don't want to be negative... but you do have to
                    address the problems, because that's what you want to put right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And now, FLO itself has how many officers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: I don't know for sure now, but I think they have a Director, Deputy
                    Director, I think about eight people in there now. It really has grown
                    tremendously. Perhaps nine persons with secretaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That can have disadvantages. It becomes too much a
                        bureaucracy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes, I think it can have many disadvantages. I feel that the FLO grew
                    rather too quickly perhaps in some ways. I don't know, but I just feel that way.
                    Choosing the personnel for it, too, may not always have been just right. I mean,
                    they've been done with good intent, but the positions in there can be “sticky”.
                    I mean, they're dealing with people very often much older than themselves, more
                    experienced in some cases in the ways of life. And when a person has to go in as
                    a tried and true Foreign Service spouse and talk to somebody about things which
                    are very intimate and of great concern to them, and very meaningful to them, if
                    this information is not treated very, very carefully, if the recipient of the
                    information is too bureaucratic in her attitude, I think it can be simply
                    appalling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can be very inhibiting...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>DORMAN: I have heard all sorts of stories coming out of FLO, and I think, on the
                    whole, it has done far more good than to the contrary. Certainly, there could
                    have been improvement. Sometimes, there have been real problems in the office,
                    and I think one of the really bad things is that the people who complain may
                    come to me and say something, and you say: “Look, this has nothing to do with me
                    now. You must go to the Director. If you want to complain, complain to the
                    Director or the Deputy Director, pronto.” They don't always bother to do this.
                    Now, a part of that problem is they may make a telephone call, the Director is
                    in a meeting — they attend a lot of meetings — and then they don't bother to get
                    back. Perhaps they are in a hotel or paying - who knows? Getting into the
                    Department now particularly is very difficult with all the security business,
                    so, you know, there are a lot of things that are against it.</p>
                <p>The whole idea originally was that the doors were all open, the little banquettes
                    were filled with children. The idea was when we chose the offices that they'd be
                    close to the C Street entrance and easy for the children to get in with their
                    parents. And that space was for children, you see? Now, we see doors closed. We
                    have sometimes seen a much more closed shop.</p>
                <p>Now, I understand it is an extremely difficult thing when you're dealing with the
                    Bureaucracy. First of all, the office had to establish itself. Janet Lloyd and
                    Mette Beecroft did a wonderful job here. They had to get on, establish
                    themselves, gain the respect of the Department, refute any concerns that may
                    have existed against their being, stride out to new spheres and deal with
                    everything, and they really achieved all these. Yet, the doors were always open,
                    the smiles were always there and there was a tremendous welcome sign. I really
                    feel, without any criticism intended, that was the whole idea of those of us who
                    brought this office into being. I don't see that atmosphere there anymore.</p>
                <p>When the Canadian High Commissioner came down to talk to some of us — I was
                    privileged to talk with him — that was one of their concerns, that the office
                    like that would automatically, because of the nature of the beast, become too
                    bureaucratic in its attitudes and the people in it become too bureaucratic and
                    set in their ways. And that is why they have never really opened an exactly-like
                    office. Their office is not that. They have something, but it is not comparable.
                    I do think it's always a danger, if you will. It's always denied by the people
                    who work in the office, and I think sometimes they don't even see it. The
                    President of AAFSW is always supposed to be an advisor.There is a plaque in the
                    main office from the State Department, which was given to the AAFSW, stating
                    their whole contribution to this affair. And it hangs there, but nobody ever
                    sees it anymore, because the doors are closed.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>I think they do have another office on the other side where the secretary is
                    friendly, and they have been for a long time, very welcoming, very nice, but I
                    think there should have been a photographic history in that big office, perhaps.
                    Not of all the reigning directors, but of the fact that... And what has happened
                    is, you will see a Director leaving, you will see them receiving a check for
                    $300 or $500, you will see them getting meritorious honor awards or superior
                    honor awards, compared to whom you will never hear them say, “This office was
                    founded by AAFSW volunteers. It is to them that we owe our thanks.” Not the
                    names of the team, but the Association. That you do not see, and that annoys the
                    daylights out of me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Many of these directors would not have gotten their jobs in that office
                    if they hadn't been a part of AAFSW. Many of them worked with AAFSW and some of
                    them did not, but some of them did. And it seems to me that... that is something
                    that is...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We are getting farther and farther away from the years of
                        the founding of it, and it has become a part of the Bureaucracy. That's
                        where their funds come from. They now must establish a budget every year;
                        they must go to the Administration people and the Office of Management and
                        Budget (OMB) to say, “We need a Skills Bank or we need someone to do this.”
                        They don't come to AAFSW, and that's the problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, that is the problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: AAFSW was the Mother Lode, but they don't say that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: No, and I think it's a very bad thing they don't. I do think, however,
                    that they should be reminded by AAFSW, and it shouldn't be a question of them
                    telling AAFSW what to do. AAFSW is still the Mother there, and the OBC — I cut
                    the ribbon with Martin Ackerman to open that, I was very privileged — and I
                    think they are doing very good things, but we always felt there was a very
                    slight strain between these two offices. I think that perhaps is being broken
                    down, which is an excellent thing. I'm glad that there's more freedom now, I
                    hope there is. But they are two separate entities and they are dealing
                    ostensibly with family concerns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The OBC, we should say, is the Overseas Briefing Center
                        which trains families to go overseas, and FLO... how would you characterize
                        it? It is the link between the State Department and the families.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes, I would say not only the State Department... let's please... I
                    remember not too long ago, Mike Deedo, when he was in training at AID, had to
                    give $5,000 of his training money, very much indeed, to FLO. It's the agencies,
                    USIA and AID that are concerned with this.</p>
                <p>I just want to read the names of the original members of the Steering Committee
                    of the Forum: There was my humble self; Jean Vance, Chairman of the Forum;
                    members of the Steering Committee were Mavis Barrett, Jesse Bartlett, who is now
                    deceased regrettably, Cynthia Chard, Virginia Egan, Janet Hawley, Mary Holmes,
                    Janice Kennedy, Stephanie Smith Kinney, Alice Lowenthal. And there were many
                    people who worked with it as well, but that was the original committee cited as
                    such in the Forum Report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, we'd better move on here. We've got the Forum Report
                        written. We had the FLO established. What would you say was the next thing
                        out of that Forum Report? The divorcespouses? Did that become a big
                        issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, yes. A lot of concerns were addressed by the Secretary and some of
                    them are still being addressed. Yes, divorced spouses and employment were the
                    major things. The medical part, we felt, we had addressed as well as we
                    could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that? Complaints about care abroad?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes, and care at home, too, with examinations. And I think there are
                    still problems there unfortunately. But, who knows? One should not be judge and
                    jury. But we did feel that after those six hours, we had really gotten through
                    and dealt with the mental health side of things. We tried to make some things a
                    little more equitable. However, I did feel that when the Iran hostages were
                    taken, and the wives were here, that they were not dealt with by the Medical
                    Division as astutely as they should have been or as wisely as they should have
                    been.</p>
                <p>There again, it's a matter of the staff changing in the Medical Division, and
                    it's very important for sound handovers there and for some form of supervision.
                    Really, FLO should be supervising this, in my opinion. They should be seeing
                    that the families are properly cared for, and the families should be able to
                    report to them if, indeed, they find there is a lack of proper treatment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think they are generally.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>DORMAN: I think they are, too, and certainly watching education. Judith
                    Livingston is working on that in the FLO and has done a marvelous job. She's a
                    very bright woman; she's been a professor at George Washington University, has a
                    Ph.D... “Dr. Livingston, I presume.” (laughs) She's a wonderful person, and I
                    think she has done well. I think the overseas school division also has perked up
                    quite considerably of late. We really worked on the schooling, because that is
                    so important. And it is really very necessary that it's dealt with with acumen
                    and skill.</p>
                <p>After this, immediately, because I'm a great believer in keeping things on the
                    upsurge — and I mention this before I go on to the divorce side of things — we
                    did have an Economic and Legal Seminar, put together by Jesse Bartlett, who was
                    a lawyer and graduate of Oxford University in England... although she's an
                    American. Very bright woman. She is now deceased which is regrettable, a very
                    great loss. We did this over at the Foreign Service Institute (FSI). Jesse got
                    together some of the best lawyers from Maryland, Virginia, and the District. We
                    had this all-day Seminar, and it was brilliantly run and awfully well done.</p>
                <p>From it, we did indeed write the Report of the Economic and Legal Seminar, which
                    I believe is still around to be had, I hope. I think it is so important to keep
                    going on with things. We also did a very big Seminar for the International Year
                    of the Child called “A Child of Many Nations”. Susan Donnelly and Linda Bell
                    chaired this. We pulled in Jane Freeman, wife of Orville Freeman, as the
                    moderator. She was head of the Girl Scouts at that time. And Gay Vance I invited
                    to come, and I introduced Gay and Jane. And USIA taped it, and it was reportedly
                    supposed to have been sent to posts around the world. Personally, I never saw it
                    or heard of anyone who saw it, but I haven't made a great effort in finding
                    out.</p>
                <p>We made a very minimal charge for this and we pulled in military wives, embassy
                    wives from foreign embassies here in Washington, and, of course, our own Foreign
                    Service people.That was good, because it also helped the State Department,
                    because something that had been planned didn't work out, and I think it covered
                    all corners by our doing it in the Department. We went into workshops and dealt
                    with all the different things which affect young people, so that was good.</p>
                <p>The next thing, as far as divorce is concerned, was Survivor Annuities and Pro
                    Rata Share. The divorce really seemed to be on the upswing in the Foreign
                    Service. It may have been on the upswing everywhere. I think, it's got out of
                    hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do we really know? We don't know if the Foreign Service
                        has more divorce than the rest of the population, do we?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>DORMAN: No, we don't know that. The problem is, we don't know from the Foreign
                    Service point of view. We tried to get statistics, and the Department really
                    won't relinquish those, because once a person has been divorced, as far as the
                    foreign affairs agencies are concerned (and that's all of them), the spouse is
                    no longer... never has anything to do with anything. Talk about non-persons!
                    They've become a myth! It doesn't matter whether they've been aboard for thirty
                    or forty years, they still become absolutely a non-entity. That is one of the
                    dreadful things about it all. We decided that something just had to be done to
                    try to secure for those wives who had not received equitable divorce
                    settlements. Some wives had had very equitable divorce proceedings for many
                    years. The husbands have been tremendously honorable. The judge has been decent.
                    It has been done in a state where people, where the judiciary, have treated the
                    manner with seriousness and, indeed, with the right sense of keeping the wife's
                    side well in mind. A part of the problem came about, of course, because of No
                    Fault Divorce which in turn came about because of the great desire to go forward
                    with great freedom for women, which we want. But, you know, it “ricochet
                    romances” in this way. (laughs)</p>
                <p>I had testified before Claude Pepper's Committee on Aging with John Burton in the
                    Chair. That was one of the first times I had testified, and it was really the
                    most terrifying experience of my life, because Dr. Joyce Brothers was there and,
                    of course, she is really very well known, quite notorious, charming woman. They
                    had the TV and the lights. And after her was Eleanor Smeal, who was the
                    President of the National Organization of Woman (NOW), then has come back.
                    However, the lights did not stay on for poor Eleanor. As soon as Dr. Brothers
                    had given her talk, the lights went off and the television cameras removed
                    themselves, and... may the good Lord be praised, as far as I was
                    concerned...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think it was political?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: I don't know, but the thing is that after Ellie Smeal, I testified, and
                    there were a lot of...</p>

                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: No, no. (laughs) Very dim indeed, very dim. Almost darkness by that time.
                    And it was, of course, on these women who had been left in these unfortunate
                    circumstances.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How many were there, would you say?</hi>

                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, that's another story. I would have thought probably about 80, but
                    the State Department always put the figure at 150, but you always got to put
                    more. We have discovered more since, because a lot of those people in the main
                    were people who had fairly reasonable good divorce settlements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, we're not talking about a large, large group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: No, we weren't, but it was enough to... oh, it was more than 80, because
                    I'm basically talking about the group that was left afterwards, I'm sorry. It
                    was, I suppose, about 150. It wasn't an enormous group, but the point was that
                    the ones who were suffering were suffering badly, and it was a sense of
                    injustice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The reason I raised the numbers was because the military
                        wives, after we got the pension part, the military wives wanted the same.
                        And there, of course, you're talking about thousands.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, interesting that you would mention that and very appropriate too,
                    if I may say so. When they knew we were doing it, the military wives came to me,
                    to us, and offered to give all their support. And my response was, “Be in the
                    room, but keep quiet, because if we can get it, then we can help you get it, but
                    we're a smaller group and, therefore, it would be much bettenot...</p>

                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Absolutely not. And then subsequently to that, I got in touch with Bill
                    Colby and went ahead, and we helped the CIA wives go forward and have worked
                    with them in various ways in connection with this. But going back, there were
                    very good people: Olympia Snow, Pat Schroeder, Barbara Mikulski, and... I'm
                    trying to think of the name of the lady who ran for VicPresident...(laughs)</p>

                    And a whole group of women... this whole Committee was stacked with numbers of

                        liberation, and in the Congress it was an opportune moment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, it was opportune, and I covered quite a wide spectrum in my brief.
                    It wasn't just on Survivor Annuities and Pro Rata Sharing. It was employment
                    opportunities and a general going forward for the spouse.</p>
                <p>And then, after that, Patricia Ryan testified with me, and Marcia Curran, both of
                    them. Marcia Curran, of course, later on, became a Director of FLO. Marcia
                    testified. This was before the Post Office and Civil Service Committee of the
                    House with Pat Schroeder in the Chair and Dante Fascell, who is now Chairman of
                    the Foreign Affairs Committee in the House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And who, I think, has always been a real supporter of the
                        Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes, he has, and in a very genuine way. He was a very decent man indeed.
                    Ginny Schlunt, who was a lawyer and his Administrative Assistant, and I did a
                    lot of work together. She's no longer with him; she's on her own now. But he's
                    excellent. He's the sort of man whom, I think, we need in the Congress. He had
                    really only met me a couple of times and one was when I testified. Subsequent to
                    that, it was a meeting at State. He came right across the room to talk to me.
                    Now, I mean, I wasn't of any importance, and even if I had been, which I wasn't,
                    I thought that was a very decent thing for him to do. I really feel that's the
                    sort of man he is. When he had a heart attack, I wrote him a letter. I was no
                    longer President of AAFSW. He wrote me a charming letter back, you know, “thank
                    you”, he's a very decent man. I like him. He's very good. I think it's good that
                    he's in the position he's in at the moment.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Patricia testified on divorce, Marcia on employment, and I on the
                    overall. Also Bibs Thurston testified in her own right. She has a tremendous
                    sense of the legalities of all this and was commended by Fascell, because of her
                    extreme knowledge on the legal aspect of this. She'd been divorced for many
                    years and she's made an absolute study of it. It's amazing the knowledge that
                    she has.</p>
                <p>We had real problems in the House, overall, because a lot of men had been
                    divorced. Then we testified before the Senate Subcommittee of the Senate Foreign
                    Relations Committee, Clairborne Pell in the Chair, and Javits wandering in and
                    out, and other people present. He asked... the Chairman asked me... Senator
                    Pell... why we were called the Association of American Foreign Service Women,
                    and wasn't that...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Wasn't that chauvinistic?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>DORMAN: Exactly right, against the men. And I pointed out to him, as I did on
                    Panorama, that the League of Women Voters has, for years, always retained its
                    name and yet it has had not only male volunteers, but male employees, and that I
                    thought we were known by this name and that men were very open to...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Welcome.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Very welcome, and indeed I had really tried to get men to join, but I
                    didn't go on about that. In the end, he asked me quite a number of questions. We
                    had been to see him ahead of time and talked to him, and he simply said, “I'm
                    going with you right across the board, Mrs. Dorman.” So, I was very pleased,
                    because we really needed this. Unfortunately, OMB, of course, played a big part
                    in all this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: A date was fixed, not necessarily with OMB, but a date was fixed as
                    February 15, 1981, and anyone who was divorced prior to that date was not
                    included. Now, what happened was, this is not a mandatory decision, but it did
                    give the women a right to go before the judge with no prejudice. And unless
                    something very bad could be proven against them, they really got a good chance
                    of getting their rights and in a proper climate.</p>
                <p>What we have to remember, which in a way has a sense of unfairness to it, each
                    state has its different rules, as we know. California is probably divided right
                    across, and that is the case in several other states. But if sometimes one does
                    get a judge who is not very sympathetic for whatever reasons, it is hard and
                    sometimes the women aren't very fair in the judiciary, which is interesting. But
                    on the whole, most of the divorces have gone fairly well. But we had this group
                    of women... the 80... that was the number of women to which I was referring
                    earlier, yes, that was left out. It's a bit more now, but the number was
                    nebulous. Now we think we've got it at last. Yes, we do. It's in the
                    Appropriations Bill now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: 1976. It's been eleven years. I have worked all along with this group and
                    so have other people. Very hard. I think Pam Moffat has now been working very
                    hard to get this resolved. She's the President of AAFSW now. Tory Whitman in the
                    State Department should be mentioned. Excellent, in this regard. And Bill
                    Bacchus, who has been maligned unfairly by the women, I think. He's a wonderful
                    human being and done everything he possibly could, and people have to understand
                    that there's only so far that you can go with this thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you have for them now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, the Pro Rata and Survivor Annuity, and what is happening is that it
                    is not coming from the husband at all. It will be given to the spouse according
                    to the rank of the husband at the time of the divorce. And if they are getting
                    anything from the husband, that will be deducted from what she will get, but
                    basically, it is a great step forward. They don't get Medicare. We had hoped to
                    get that, as some of these Pro Ratas can be quite low. Some people only get a
                    little something, over a thousand a month pro rata, so that is not enough, but
                    it is certainly better than what they are not getting now, you see?</p>
                <p>Some of them are living off their children. We have people in absolute penury. It
                    is really very serious. There have been all sorts of cases, and you have to be
                    sure that what you're hearing is accurate, because when people go through a lot
                    of stress and strain, there is a great tendency sometimes — well not a great
                    tendency always — but a tendency for stories to get a little flaky, so one has
                    to be careful. But these cases will be properly adjudicated. The money is not
                    coming from the spouse. It is coming from somewhere else. It's coming from a
                    fairer source. They're not going to take from anyone else. So I do think that
                    this matter, hopefully today, should be resolved in the House. It goes to the
                    full vote today, and then it goes to the Senate, and I really do pray fervently
                    that this goes through. These women have waited so long, some of them have said,
                    “We are going to be dead and buried before anything happens.” Working with them
                    every so often, once a month, and trying to keep their spirits up, I ended up by
                    saying a year or so ago that they really had to do more to help themselves. They
                    do seem to have been doing that. And it does seem to be more effective. AAFSW
                    helped immeasurably.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we stuck with them. Who else has worked with
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Patty Ryan worked awfully hard with them when she was here as Forum
                    Chairman and, as a matter of fact, a lot of our other things have gone
                    practically by the board in order to help this group, because there's only a
                    limited time in anyone's life. We have all got our own families to be concerned
                    with and many people with employment, as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, what else would you say...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>DORMAN: I testified also before the White House Committee on Families, which was,
                    I think, a good thing, because all of these things are important. There was a
                    lot of news about this in The Washington Post. Judy Mann wrote articles about
                    it. It was in The Star. And in The New York Times and The Chicago Herald
                    Tribune. It was all over the place, and that's the sort of thing that makes the
                    public understand. It also gives the public an insight into the fact that we in
                    the Foreign Service exist, because, I think, it was the Iran crisis that really
                    got us known as the Foreign Service. I think around the country a lot of people
                    in the U.S. don't even know of the existence of the Foreign Service. You know,
                    unsung heroes and heroines. We've all been exposed to terrorism of some sort. I
                    mean, evacuations, riots galore, and I had been told once that my husband had
                    been killed, when he hadn't. All sorts of terrifying things. And that was said
                    in front of my two children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We need to build a constituency of friends and people who
                        understand. You mentioned that you were on Panorama with Janet Lloyd?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes, Janet Lloyd and I did a lot of radio programs at different times...
                    CBS, PBS. Did one for PBS in the FLO office, and we really got very used to
                    working together. We sort of complemented each other very well. If she was on
                    and I wasn't talking, she would bring me in, and vice versa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your purpose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, we were invited to be on Panorama, because people had heard about
                    the Forum Report, because that was what I was supposed to speak on and the
                    bringing about of the M/FLO. Before the program in the morning (Panorama is at
                    noon, as you recall), I had had esp, if you will, that I might be asked a
                    question on the intake of the Foreign Service, whether this had been changed at
                    all by the taking of the hostages in Tehran, Iran, and I had called Clint
                    Lauderdale, who was then in that office in the State Department to ask him for
                    numbers. He was very pleased that I had done this, and I got the number of the
                    intake for that year. I got the numbers of the people who had passed the written
                    exam and those who'd passed the oral and the final acceptance, and his
                    permission to, indeed, divulge these facts.</p>
                <p>He also asked me if I would put in a word for advocacy while I was able to talk,
                    which I did, and I was asked this question, and it was very interesting. I was
                    also asked the question again why we were called the Association of American
                    Foreign Service Women. I think he said “wives”, the interviewer, and I said
                    “This will get me hung, drawn and quartered... this is women”, and I said “We do
                    have single people as members. We have Staff Corps people as members and
                    officers who are members of the Foreign Service themselves, and therefore, that
                    is what it is called.”</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>We talked about the hostage situation, and we talked about various things very
                    briefly. Ambassador Popper had joined us, because he had written an article
                    which had been published in The New York Times, and he came aboard at the last
                    minute. He had been on TV, obviously, many times before and was fairly vocal,
                    articulate, and in the end a man came with a big sign saying: “Lesley Dorman, do
                    your stuff now!” I had a copy of the Forum Report with me, and as soon as I
                    could, with dignity, I interjected and then said my piece. Then, I was able to
                    get Janet Lloyd in by saying that “my good colleague, who is Janet Lloyd, is
                    Director of the Office,” and I managed to work it in that way.</p>
                <p>I had been asked the question on the intake before that, prior to that, but it
                    was a very satisfactory interview. It was a half hour instead of the usual ten
                    minutes. We were rather privileged, we thought, and people that heard it were
                    very pleased with it, both in the Department and out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the interviewer? Was it Maury Povich?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: No, it wasn't. He was away. I cannot remember who it was. I have to say,
                    with due respect, that I wouldn't mention the name, because I wasn't impressed
                    with the person. I didn't think he had done his homework awfully well, and he
                    was a bit antagonistic. I thought, indeed, one had to challenge him politely if
                    he said the wrong thing, and I felt that instead of taking that with humor,
                    he... Most of those people are rather good on that show. It's a very good show,
                    I think, but he didn't worry us at all. The producer was a woman who was
                    marvelous and she went on to work for Ted Turner's outfit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That broadcast helped to put AAFSW and its work on the
                        map?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes. And, you know, the broadcasts were very useful, because I remember
                    driving one day and hearing... what they did... they did some with Janet and
                    myself together, talking together... then they took out and used these
                    broadcasts for weeks. They took out segments, and I could hear my voice coming
                    out as I was driving, nearly causing an accident. I remember my dentist saying
                    to me once, in the middle of filling a tooth or something diabolical, “You know,
                    really, I would have been quite happy to have married somebody in the Foreign
                    Service. You really make it sound great!” And I thought that's good, because we
                    do have these negatives as well, but it's so important for us to be loyal to
                    what we work with. If you can't be loyal, get out. I really feel we have a great
                    sense of pride in the Service, whatever our concerns about it may be, and that's
                    very important.</p>

                        Lesley. I know that there are several other things... many other things you

                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Oh, yes, after I was President. It wasn't exactly blackmail, but I got
                    Patty Ryan to agree to be President, because five years was just more
                    than...</p>

                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: No, none at all, fortunately, but I did have a chary feeling about being
                    on the Board after being President, in fairness to the next President. But Patty
                    and I were very good friends, and I was very careful in my conduct on the Board.
                    So we didn't have any problems. I said the one thing I would do, since she asked
                    me, would be Program.</p>
                <p>It was a job I enjoyed more than anything else. It has got so many possibilities.
                    Lots of frustrations, very nerve wracking. You never know if anyone is going to
                    come on time. Art Buchwald used to rush in at the last moment, but he always
                    used to say: “Lesley Dorman calls, I come”. (laughs) I felt rather flattered by
                    that, but anyway, he didn't mean it, I'm sure, but he was great fun. We had
                    people like Barbara Tuchman and we had Marvin Kalb, who was very popular,
                    because not being a member of the foreign affairs agencies, being an outside
                    newsman, he could really tell it as he saw it and not as he felt he ought to
                    report it. He was very, very good. Walter Stoessel, of course, who was Acting
                    Secretary of State twenty one times, not only came and talked to us, but he also
                    moderated a panel on the Soviet Union for me with William Handley, who's very
                    well known. And Dimitri Simes, who is indeed a Russian, who came out from the
                    Soviet Union not too many moons ago. We were going to have Ann Garrels from ABC,
                    but she fell by the wayside, but we got a replacement for her. We had Bruce
                    Laingen, ocourse, Penne, your dear husband, who talked to us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was excellent (laughs).</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: He was first class, yes, he was great. And we had lots of panels on the
                    Soviet Union, on Poland, and arts and sciences, tours to the Hill and to
                    Winterthur and so much more. I always have a committee when I do something, try
                    to get expertise on it, people who have access to the art world in Washington
                    and that sort of thing, so it's really more fun. I still go out after most of
                    the speakers as the Program Chairman, but delegate them to others, so people
                    feel a sense of responsibility and enjoyment themselves. It is a lot of
                    teamwork.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today, now, with so many wives working, how do you think
                        the programs are going in AAFSW?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, I think one of the concerns that I have stated quite openly and
                    honestly both to the present Program Chairman, who is a darling, Susan Mallick,
                    and also some other people, that I feel there should be a separation between
                    some of the programs. In other words, some programs should take place elsewhere
                    other than the Eighth Floor. I think people like to come to the Eighth Floor
                    where most of our programs take place, because those diplomatic rooms are
                    marvelous and should be seen, and people like to bring guests to see them and so
                    forth. But I really do feel very strongly that a lot of our members are not
                    interested in the real advocacy programs that we have, because we have members
                    of varying ages and we have a lot of our Bookfair supporters and, therefore,
                    that would be my main criticism. Programs are difficult, because we don't pay
                    our speakers. It's all pro bono, and it's not easy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, if you get those speakers of that quality that you
                        got in, what 1978...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: 1981-82, after I was President. These were all during my time as Program
                    Chairman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't that much longer ago, and yet, I don't feel that
                        the same quality or standard is being given to us. The reason is that the
                        audience is so many retired and that younger women work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: No, I don't really think it is a problem, because we have so many younger
                    members now, and a lot of the programs are for them. As I say, there should be
                    separate lunches which we can do sometimes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or dinner or night programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, we did try night programs, but we didn't get anybody to sign up for
                    it at all, and I don't know why. I agree with you, but people don't like to
                    drive after dark, a lot of them, not even the younger people enjoy it
                    particularly, or they get home and they're tired, or they may work. We tried
                    noon meetings, luncheon meetings for the working people, but they haven't been
                    successful. We did when I was President a program on mental health which Mrs.
                    Carter came to, for example. Dr. Steven Hirsh, who is a psychiatrist, and many
                    other very good people were othe panel. I had been working with the Forum Group
                    with Dr. Peter Bourne. I wouldn't go to the White House, but then he had a
                    meeting which he wanted me to attend to meet Dr. Herbert Pardee, Director of the
                    National Institute for Mental Health. This was held at the White House, and
                    other members of the Forum team were present.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel, speaking of Mrs. Carter, that what the First
                        Lady or the Secretary of State's wife contributes or puts in has a great
                        deal to do with how AAFSW is perceived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: No, actually, I don't. In fairness, we were very lucky with Gay Vance and
                    Adele Rogers, very supportive. She was a darling woman. I think all of them have
                    been supportive, many of them, except one or two who perhaps weren't interested.
                    I think Mrs. Shultz is very supportive...Obie Shultz. It's just the fact that I
                    really don't think it makes that much difference. I think that in Gay's case,
                    she was marvelous, because she got together and I was privileged to be on this
                    particular panel, when we met and got together with Congressional and Senatorial
                    wives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can we go on and talk about how privileged you felt to be
                        a part of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes, I'm very happy to talk about this briefly. There were two sets of
                    meetings that Gay had organized. One was the meeting that we used to have, a
                    pre-planning session with the Congressional wives, and we would have these
                    meetings at the State Department usually. Sometimes, we had lunch in the
                    Secretary's Office. We would brown bag our lunch, all of us would bring our own,
                    and we'd have this lovely china and we'd be sitting there with these brown bags.
                    But there were people like Lorraine Percy and Casey Ribicoff and a whole group
                    of people. We used to plan meetings. Sometimes we'd go to the Hill and they
                    would be the hostesses, and sometimes they would come to the State Department.
                    There would be a special program on a certain part of the world. Then, various
                    members of AAFSW and other Foreign Service wives, who may not be members, would
                    be invited to attend. And they were very informative and it gave this
                    rapprochement with the Hill, which was very necessary.</p>
                <p>And then, the other meetings that we had fairly frequently were very, very
                    useful, where representation from the OBC, the M/FLO, AAFSW (that was
                    represented by myself or someone else if I couldn't be there), and ambassadors'
                    wives, who were in on leave, perhaps the Director of the FSI to talk about what
                    he was doing, somebody else to talk about advocacy, various things. Gay Vance
                    would be in the Chair.</p>
                <p>And this was followed forward, after Gay left, by Jane Muskie and then Pat Haig.
                    I think after Pat Haig left this rather fell by the wayside. And I know that, to
                    the best of my knowledge, this is not being done under the present
                    Administration, which I feel is a very great pity, because it brings about the
                    opportunity for the wife of the Secretary of State and other people in the
                    hierarchy (Jean Newsom used to attend when David had the top slot of the Foreign
                    Service). It's really important, because all sorts of grievances — not
                    necessarily grievances — but all sorts of ideas can be aired and talked over and
                    debated and arbitrated, and it's really very good.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>As far as the Forum's work, we initiated meetings with the Congressional wives,
                    whichever Congressional year was in. We would meet with that section of the
                    Congress and other people, of course, that had been there for years also
                    attended these meetings. We would meet informally. There was just a very small
                    group of us. They would invite us to the Hill and all sorts of things. And I
                    remember there was this big group that Gay was involved with... Jim Wright, who
                    is now Speaker of the House, had us up, took care of us up there. And this
                    really is important.</p>
                <p>The Forum Group of AAFSW made it clear to the Congressional wives in no uncertain
                    terms that we were meeting because we had mutual concerns, not because we wanted
                    our concerns to be relayed to their husbands through “pillow talk”, if I may use
                    that phrase. We were very genuine in this, because...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a sense of belonging...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You belong to the Foreign Service, and they belong to the
                        Congress, but you're together in your purposes...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, we both move all the time, and we both have schooling concerns, we
                    have medical concerns, leaving their doctors in their home states and coming
                    here, you know, and it was really very fruitful. That seemed to disappear, and
                    I'm very sorry about that. I think continuity, you know, every now and again, an
                    organization has to look at itself and it has to say, “Do we need to keep this
                    going? Do we need to keep that?” And then, according to the dictates of what is
                    deemed important, then the good things should go forward and the things that
                    were perhaps very good, but are no longer needed, may need to be cast aside. I
                    think you need to look at yourself every now and again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You need to be flexible, but you also need to stop
                        reinventing the wheel every few years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: I feel that too. I couldn't agree more. That's part of the problem. I do
                    think AAFSW did everything it possibly could. I used to brief... the President
                    of AAFSW usually briefs ambassadors' wives, DCMs' wives, going overseas. If
                    they're not members, they quickly join (laughs), and you know the thing works
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The second thing I wanted to ask you about, beyond your
                        work as Program Chairman, was the inner city projects that AAFSW has done
                        through the years? What was your contribution in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Oh, yes, the inner city projects. I worked very hard, still am, as a
                    matter of fact. AAFSW... I think Polly Jones started this, and this was also
                    carried on by Dotty Kidder and other people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year? Can you give me an idea... in the forties,
                        fifties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, AAFSW was convened in its present form in 1960.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, that's right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: And the Bookfair started in 1961, that was the first year. The inner city
                    projects, I would say, in the middle to late sixties were started. And it was a
                    very good idea. We have done a lot of work. Adele Rogers still comes to work...
                    well, she lives in Washington, in Bethesda... at the Simmons School, even when
                    she's with Bill in New York. It's not called the Simmons School now...</p>
                <p>I'm trying to think... it's got a new name. But, in any event, it's a school in
                    the inner city. She's just a marvelous person. So, that is something that we
                    did. We've done a lot of different things. We've done displays of all sorts of
                    artifacts at the State Department from all around the world and had these groups
                    in, but that was beginning not to work too well, so that was dismissed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was security, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, it was partly security and it was partly the fact that the groups
                    seemed to be younger and younger and not very appreciative, unable to
                    understand, they were really too young, and I felt... well, we felt... that the
                    program was a lot of work, but it really didn't achieve very much. We'd been in
                    classes and talked about various countries we'd been to. Classes in Virginia and
                    Maryland and the District.</p>
                <p>We've worked with Area B Mental Health, which has now been consolidated; I think
                    it's now Area A, but we did an awful lot of work there, not just giving money to
                    it, which is done liberally, but working too. And when the new wing was built,
                    we helped with different things, gave toys, went and talked to the children,
                    went and talked with the people that were there and so forth.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>And then the Eastern Branch Boys and Girls Clubs of Greater Washington, the
                    Women's Auxiliary, which was started by AAFSW members, Ruth Bond and June Byrne,
                    who incidentally was thperson who started AAFSW in 1960. She's now June Spencer.
                    She was widowed and remarried. The Women's Auxiliary (I sit on the Board now),
                    we do a lot of good, a tremendous number of things, and AAFSW gives us a great
                    deal of monetary support and they give us moral support. The community
                    representative attends many of the Board meetings, and we, in turn, the Women's
                    Auxiliary, give a luncheon for AAFSW once a year, which is coming up next week.
                    The Auxiliary arranges for scholarships for young people.</p>
                <p>So, you know, we really concern ourselves. We've given money and help to Martha's
                    Table, to Children's Hospital, to the House of Ruth, a tremendous amount of
                    support there, and to many organizations in the inner city where we feel it's
                    important. We've done one-time stands. We've given lots of books to various
                    people that have asked us for them, from the Book Room and so on, when we feel
                    there has been a really genuine need.</p>
                <p>I think this is a marvelous participation, and we are the only entity of the
                    Foreign Service that has really addressed itself to the inner city of
                    Washington. We worked terribly hard to get the money and it all goes to good
                    works. Very commendable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We mustn't forget the Bookfair. It gives money for
                        scholarships.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: That's a tremendous amount of work, and I must say it got to such a point
                    during my Administration we decided to pay the Book Room Coordinator, because
                    she was working five days a week, and that's unreasonable to expect anyone to do
                    that. That's been going on for years, and more and more money is obtained, so we
                    are able to give money to inner city concerns. It's really a business now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The money really goes to scholarships, doesn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes, that's exactly right. The main part of the money goes to
                    scholarships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For Foreign Service children?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: For Foreign Service children. And the scholarships... some are merit,
                    which are not very large, and most of them are need. The need, of course, is
                    done through Princeton. They determine that. They deal with that. But the merit,
                    we have a panel every year... I've sat on that. In fact, I'm happy to say, I
                    just remembered it, isn't that frightful? That the first time that the
                    scholarships were honoring an AAFSW member, I was the honoree. It was given in
                    my name (laughs). I was rather embarrassed by it all.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it's wonderful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: I should take these accolades more graciously. (laughs). I sort of giggle
                    nervously and go into a decline.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What can you tell me about the Hertz Symposium. What is
                        the title? “Diplomacy: The Role of the Spouse.” When was that put
                        together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, Martin Hertz called me and said he was going to do a written
                    symposium and would I please write an article for it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was in 1981?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes, it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Georgetown, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: It's under the auspices of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy. It's
                    the Edward A. Walsh School of Foreign Service, Georgetown University, and the
                    written symposium is “Diplomacy: The Role of the Wife,” and it's edited by
                    Martin Hertz with a Forward by the Honorable Ellsworth Bunker, dear Ellsworth.
                    Bless his heart. I agreed to do that and started to write the article and really
                    was quite far ahead. At that time, however, I was trying to get out of being
                    President of AAFSW with some urgency at this point, not because I hadn't enjoyed
                    it, or for any particular reason, but I felt it had been too long. Even felt
                    four years was too long. And I had, by fair means, I trust, got a colleague of
                    mine, who had been head of the Forum, Patricia Ryan, to agree to take the
                    Presidency. I felt, because she would be coming aboard in six months or so after
                    the writing of this, that it would be a good idea for her to have her name in
                    print. I also felt she probably could make a good contribution to the article,
                    so we both did the article, and the whole thing was very successful. You, Penne,
                    are here, having done a noble task in this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mine was the last article in it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Oh, last, but not least, I would suggest. Ours is the first. (laughs).
                    It's all very funny. Of course, Ellsworth gives his little introduction, no
                    Forward, and the first thing is an introduction by Martin Hertz, and then comes
                    Patty and myself.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the main gist of your article?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, it was the concerns, really, of the Foreign Service. Pure and
                    simple. We said that it was a very stimulating life and had undeniable rewards
                    of personal growth, travel and inter- national friendships, but for women in
                    developed areas of the world, the role of the wife of a diplomat presents
                    problems, and that's exactly what it does do. As a matter of fact, I'd like to
                    read you... we talked about the political, social, and economic role of women in
                    America that has changed significantly, which is really the whole crux of the
                    change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think so too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: And this change is going to continue in various ways. And that's why when
                    people say, “How do you think the Foreign Service is going?” how can you
                    evaluate the future of the Foreign Service wife, the spouse, whether male or
                    female, in the Foreign Service? It's an impossible question to answer, because
                    how do we know how the Foreign Service is going to evolve? It has changed
                    itself, remarkably, far more than any of us would have expected, and probably
                    has a lot more changing to do. Perhaps not a lot, but some, I would suggest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it might get very drastic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: I think it might get drastic, just as I said earlier. I don't want to see
                    a single Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They are bringing in so many consultants from outside and
                        there are so many political appointments...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: That, of course, I think is most regrettable, and in some cases...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the aspect that Bruce (Laingen) is trying to work
                        on, is how can we stimulate the career service. I feel, frankly, with the
                        spouse, it is necessary to bring back this feeling that the spouse is also
                        in the Foreign Service. It is perhaps the only thing that's going to help
                        revive that sense of service. Too many are staying home, you know, while the
                        husband goes overseas.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes, I would have liked to see... of course, it's very difficult to do
                    this fairly, because who adjudicates the ambassador's wife and who really can
                    say who are the bees and the drones. And we do know there will always be drones
                    given the opportunity. Life is like that. But I would have liked to see, have
                    some sort of stipend given to, frankly, every Foreign Service wife (who goes
                    abroad), because I think in this day and age... And I feel that whatever they
                    do, there should be a definite recommendation to go on a resume from the
                    ambassador or from the head of the division. That is something that can be
                    arbitrated, but I do really feel quite strongly that something has to be done,
                    because it is a job that you're doing. It is an upheaval.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a job that you're not doing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what a shame. (laughs)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Well, that, of course, is very true. And we talked in this article about
                    how the role of women in America has changed. It's not just the role of the
                    Foreign Service spouse, I don't think. It's increased mobility, longevity plays
                    a great part today, education combined with economic necessity. The rise in
                    school fees has just been simply traumatic and it's just awful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Inflation, soaring divorce rates, which we've already discussed, and so
                    forth. I think that one of the interesting things that... we went on, of course,
                    for several pages in our article, but I think that this is a piece, if you think
                    that I should read it, that is very interesting. “It is a time of transition and
                    redefinition for the wife in the diplomatic service. At present, it is far from
                    clear how the role will evolve, (which is just what we were discussing).
                    Diplomatic wives are on the whole talented, intelligent people, and with the
                    good will and cooperation of governmental institutions, they will find creative
                    solutions to the problems posed by diplomatic life in the years ahead.”</p>
                <p>Well, that is all quite questionable in a way, I think, because as we said a
                    minute ago, it is difficult to predict. We don't have esp. If anyone had told me
                    that Tropicana Orange Juice would go up from 85 cents to well over $2.00 today,
                    or whatever it is, I wouldn't have believed it then. I would have told them they
                    were out of their minds.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>Following this written symposium, Martin Hertz called me and said he wanted to do
                    an oral one, and he would like me, if I would be willing, to put together a team
                    to discuss the possibilities of it and how it should evolve. I invited Jean
                    Vance and Janet Lloyd to join me in this, and he had David Newsom aboard. And we
                    sat down with a secretary present to take notes, and did indeed bring about, I
                    hope, a fairly decent oral symposium.</p>
                <p>It was well attended, very interesting, quite controversial in some ways, and it
                    just told some more. But all these things are useful. And I think one of the
                    things that AAFSW should be thinking about in the years ahead is to keep
                    innovative. You can't become stagnant. You've got to go forward. If you can't,
                    if you haven't the personnel, because they're all working, to do everything,
                    well then, you just have to play it by ear and try to do things as they are
                    possible to do. But nothing is impossible. That is a word that should not be in
                    anyone's vocabulary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you think are today the prominent concerns? Do you
                        think it's “terrorism”? Security of families?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: To be very frank with you, I don't think “terrorism” is. I think it is
                    frightening and scary, but I think that, basically, the chances of one being
                    involved in it are very remote.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about at posts overseas, would you say it is
                        “anti-Americanism”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: I think that may well become a very difficult situation, and it depends
                    where one is posted to... the way the arms situation is... where we have
                    positioned armaments... and the locals' reactions to those armaments, like in
                    Great Britain and in Western Germany, that could be very controversial and, I
                    would say, present some very real problems. Usually when a country rises up, it
                    goes for the United States Information Agency Libraries, which is unfortunate,
                    but that's where usually their wrath seems to descend. I think as far as
                    families individually are concerned, the likelihood of their being accosted in
                    the countries that I've mentioned are very remote. But when a rabble gets loose,
                    who knows? There've been some very bad things in soccer matches, I understand,
                    in civilized parts of the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I was thinking that we've gotten through the
                        pensions and we may still have some medical problems to work on, but they're
                        pretty much under control now, don't you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes. I had heard some disquieting things, but without knowing the full
                    story, it's not fair to comment really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think spouse employment and economics are the big

                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes, I do. I think economics is the really outstanding thing today,
                    because we really don't know where we're going from here. I mean, that's the
                    problem. With the deficit now, which is astronomical... it's bound to affect
                    each one of us in one way or another. I am very concerned about the scholarship
                    situation for the young people in the country that affects the Foreign Service
                    children, the offspring. I really feel very distressed by this, because nobody
                    should have something for nothing, but the opportunities should be there for
                    higher education. Education is really so very important, isn't it Penne? We find
                    all along that an awful lot of problems exist because of lack of it... whatever
                    sphere is being addressed, and I really feel this is something the Government
                    has simply got to give more thought to.</p>

                <p>DORMAN: A lot I haven't told you. (laughs)</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you tell me what you're doing now?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes, I'm very happy to say what I'm doing. My husband isn't entirely
                    retired. He's now a member of the Academy of Arbitrators, doing some voluntary
                    work, too. But I am President of Orientation International Incorporated, which
                    is an organization that a group of us started because we felt the private sector
                    needed to have the preparation for going overseas that the Foreign Service
                    families get... and plus... because usually they don't have the same support
                    systems that Foreign Service people have within the framework of an embassy.
                    Sometimes they have more support systems. They are not persuaded to take
                    language training, which is really essential today. In many countries — Egypt is
                    a very good example — when I lived there, English was absolutely spoken
                    everywhere almost, and now it's very different. I know for a fact, you cannot
                    get a house domestic help that speaks English much anymore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, is it a rising nationalism?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>DORMAN: It's a rising nationalism, and also I think, it's not only that, I think
                    it's a fact that foreign nationals... the British Raj, for example, which really
                    brought about English to be spoken in these various countries, of course, is no
                    longer there. And the years now have elapsed where the generations have grown
                    up, who were not involved with it, so language, even if it's taught in schools,
                    is not encouraged in the way that it was before. Anyway, this organization
                    prepares both employees and business executives to do business.</p>
                <p>We just did a contract to prepare a whole group of international business
                    executives to go to nine Asian countries to do business. And we're very pleased
                    to see that this firm has gone up on the Stock Exchange since we did this
                    preparation, (laughs), quite noticeably. We do hope that the work had something
                    to do with it, and indeed, we have got some sort of assurance that if they do
                    send their families, we will be preparing their families.</p>
                <p>We do have somebody marketing for us... a man, who happens to be British, married
                    to an officer in USIA, so he's a male spouse. He also does other things. He's a
                    freelance writer, a very good one. He's marketing for us. We are really going
                    out very wide to the corporations. We've done some preparations for people going
                    to the People's Republic of China and families going to Singapore. And so, we've
                    been concentrating on mainly SE Asia. I think that has come about because the
                    Middle East is at the moment lying rather low. Business is pretty static at the
                    moment. South America is in a bit of turmoil, but we would do preparation for
                    anyone going anywhere.</p>
                <p>And we do. Our consultants are really the best that we can find. They really know
                    their stuff. We have developed our own cultural mores listing which was
                    commented upon very favorably by briefers that have worked for us, really good
                    people. We've also cultivated our negotiating skills list. The evaluation sheets
                    have been excellent. Our written materials are very good. And we also have done
                    a preparation for incoming people, foreign nationals, in Washington. We had some
                    of the World Bank people we've helped. We've really done... we work both ways.
                    We are able to help foreign nationals and we are working on a contract, a
                    possible contract at the moment, to help people coming in with a foreign motor
                    firm. These people are here for a year or so and they need help. But lots of
                    things that have to be addressed they don't understand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, your life in the Foreign Service, in summation, has
                        really helped to contribute to your ability to do this work.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>DORMAN: Yes, without a doubt. Every one of us that works with us, including our
                    marketing consultant. Long before, I suppose he'in his early forties, but long
                    before he married a Foreign Service person, he's lived with her in Belgium. He's
                    been all over the world, in Asia, and everywhere. Yes, that is one of the things
                    that I really do insist upon, because unless you've been there, you really can't
                    understand. It's not understanding for us to impart to our clients, because we
                    have experts to do that, but it's understanding what sort of experts we should
                    be reaching for. That is important. It's very interesting. You have to really
                    search for good people. You hear all sorts of people and you think, thank
                    goodness, I'm not using them for a contract, because they gea name, they're on
                    television and radio and all over the place, but they mumbo-jumbo, you know, and
                    it's got to be very clear, because a lot of people that one prepares have never
                    been out of the country. We also, whenever possible, use teenagers to prepare
                    teenagers. They can go to a pizza parlor and do their preparation. It's just
                    marvelous. They're told to end on a positive note, but to be truthful, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's end this on a positive note then. If you had
                        to do it over again, you'd do it, wouldn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>DORMAN: Oh, yes, like a shot! I loved every minute of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thank you very much. Great interview, Lesley.</hi>
