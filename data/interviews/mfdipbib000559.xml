                <p>WALTER E. JENKINS, JR.</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: February 20, 1991</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could give me a little of your background,
                        where you come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, I do tend to be a little bit mixed up, because I came from Texas
                    originally, and in my teens I moved to New England, Boston, and then attended
                    university there at Harvard. And so in my guts I'm a Texan, and in my mind I
                    tend to be a New Englander.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you graduate from Harvard?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I was the Class of '40. But since I wanted to go to Hawaii with my
                    parents, where my father was assigned as a Lieut. Colonel...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were an Army brat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I was an Army brat, right. I attended the University of Hawaii two
                    years, but dear old Harvard gave me credit for only one, so I actually left
                    Harvard in '41, Class of '40.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, that was a good class to be in. What were you studying
                        while you were at Harvard and at the University of Hawaii?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: International law and relations, mostly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What had attracted you towards this particular field?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, as I pointed out, I tended to be a little mixed up, like a lot of
                    us are. I really strongly thought I might go to the Yale School of Forestry
                    someday, because I love the out-of-doors and nature. But I think the experience
                    in childhood in the Philippines and then later in Hawaii, and the Boy Scout
                    World Jamboree in '33 in Hungary, steered me towards foreign affairs. Well, what
                    finally clinched it was my World War II experience in China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you have any experience of either the Far East
                        or Europe during the war before you graduated from college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, before graduating from college, the contact with the Far East was
                    basically my early childhood in the Philippines, during which we did visit
                    China, and then my late teens in Hawaii, where I associated with many persons of
                    Japanese, Chinese and Korean heritage at the University of Hawaii as well as
                    during my summer job in the pineapple fields.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, you graduated in 1941. What happened to you
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, I did take ROTC, so I went to summer camp at Ft. Devens during the
                    summer of 1941. And then I was called up for one year of active duty. I thought
                    that'd be great—but of course within a month, Pearl Harbor. And so I went into
                    the Army, field artillery, for the duration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any sort of international experience while you
                        were in the Army?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes, I spent two years actually, until the end of the war, in China with
                    the Stilwell Y- Force and later, the Chinese Combat Command, training Chinese
                    and then taking them into operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because we're looking at sort of the whole foreign
                        relations field here, not just limited to the Foreign Service, could you
                        tell me about some of your experiences in this as an instructor under the
                        Stilwell command—I mean, it's a very controversial, very difficult
                        period—what you were doing and how you saw the situation at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes. The first part of the experience was at an artillery training
                    center at Kan Hai- Tze, just outside of K'un-ming, in which we would train
                    officers and a corps of noncommissioned officers in the basics of artillery, and
                    then take them out to their battalions and help them train their battalions in
                    artillery, and then would accompany them in the mission of opening up the Burma
                    Road, stopping the Japanese offensive in Guangxi or protecting the border with
                    Vietnam.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>Well, I did get some very special feelings at that time. In K'un-ming was one of
                    the best of the Nationalist forces, the Fifth Army. It became quite clear that
                    the Chinese government under Chiang Kai-shek, was less interested in using them
                    to open the Burma Road than for keeping an eye on the provincial Yunnanese
                    forces under Warlord Governor Lung Y�n. And I began to get the impression that
                    one of the key things of concern to Chiang and the Kuomintang was this
                    separatism of warlords and how you keep them under control. So some of his best
                    units were actually used for that purpose in our region of southwest China.</p>
                <p>Then, on accompanying the officers and non-Coms of the 18th Artillery Regiment to
                    a training area near the Burma Road, I noted they did a good job in training
                    their troops, but it became quite clear from the lectures of the political
                    officers that what they were really training for was a post-war confrontation
                    with the Communists. This unit never did go down to open up the Burma Road, but
                    was transferred east to Guangxi to face the Japanese there. Thus, I got a second
                    impression that really a lot of this training and preparation was for post-war
                    consolidation of Nationalist authority.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Stilwell when he was replaced
                        by Wedemeyer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: My feeling was that Stilwell really knew China but he couldn't harbor
                    any nonsense, either from the “Little Peanut,” as he called Chiang Kai-shek, or
                    from us. I remember when we arrived. We had flown over from Miami, and I was the
                    junior officer, the captain. All the others were older lieutenant colonels and
                    colonels. We waited in the headquarters in K'un-ming, and after a half hour
                    Stilwell came in, with his campaign hat and his riding crop. He looked around,
                    finally saying, “You know, I asked for some first rate officers, and all I get
                    is a bunch of broken-down old brass.” This was our first welcome by General
                    Stilwell.</p>
                <p>But then we learned to respect him and emulate him, in the military sense—we too
                    began wearing campaign hats and carrying riding crops.</p>
                <p>And so I think that he might have been on target as far as his assessment of
                    Chiang and what we were trying to do; but he didn't fully appreciate all of the
                    political factors involved, like China's tendency to go after local warlords,
                    his felt need to finish things off with the Communists after the war, and so
                    forth. He didn't fully appreciate the political complications in my opinion. He
                    wanted Chinese participation in defeating the Japanese, while Chiang focused on
                    the Communists and warlords and was sure the U.S. could take care of the
                    Japanese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: A little over two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I arrived in early September 1943 and left China in late September of
                    1945.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the war was over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you involved at all in, you might say, the
                        preparations for the next war, the civil war there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes, very indirectly. By this time a Lieut. Colonel, I decided to stay
                    on a while and to take a surrender team to Han-k'ou. We had an OSS team to go in
                    with us. They were to parachute from our plane and make sure the airfield was
                    secure; then we'd land and accept the Japanese surrender and collect a lot of
                    nice Samurai swords. But we never got there, because all of the planes were
                    being used to transport Chinese forces to Manchuria, to counter the Soviet
                    presence there and their support in bringing Chinese Communist troops up there.
                    It became apparent that things were really building up for this
                    Nationalist-Communist conflict at the end of the war. So I had my required
                    points and came home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You earn points for military service overseas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: When you got a hundred points, you were eligible to go home.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what happened? You didn't join the State Department
                        until 1948, so what happened in between there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, I went back to graduate school, international law and relations at
                    Harvard, and was studying hard, when I got a call from Bill Mcafee in Chinese
                    Affairs at the State Department (he had been Wedemeyer's aide). He asked, “Would
                    you be interested in a job in the State Department? There's a job opening up
                    because one of our boys is going over to USIS in Han-k'ou.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Sure.” So I came down for an interview. Fantastic. State was then in
                    what is now the Executive Office Building. I had my interviews. And then the
                    officer in charge said, “Incidentally, our president is meeting the Mexican
                    president across the street at Blair House. Let's go out on the balcony, have
                    tea and watch the parade and ceremony.”</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>I replied, “Okay, let's do it.” We did, and my overall reaction was, “Boy, this
                    is the job for me.”</p>
                <p>But the Congress knocked out the USIA post in Han-k'ou, so I had to wait an
                    additional year, and joined State in '48. By then State had moved to the former
                    War Department Building at 21st and C Streets, so I didn't have tea on the
                    balcony that frequently.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, I spent a pleasant year teaching at the University of Texas in
                    Austin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First, you were a civil servant, from '48 to '50, is that
                        right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: From '48 to '50 I was a Civil Servant and then became a Foreign Service
                    Officer (FSO) in 1950.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing? What were your responsibilities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, Bill Mcafee knew my military experience in China, and he wanted a
                    helper. He was political-military. And basically my job was to help him follow
                    the course of the civil war. These were turbulent times in China, of course, and
                    it wasn't going well for the Nationalists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Forty-eight was really kind of the end of the line.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Right up into '49, when they went over to Taiwan. And so we followed the
                    course of the military operations, and also I monitored the $125 million
                    military aid program we were giving to the Nationalist Chinese. Those two jobs
                    kept me pretty busy, and it was a fascinating period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the impression at the time? You know, so much has
                        been written about the China hands and all this, but as a practical measure,
                        I mean, here you are on the ground working on the East Asia...it was East
                        Asia at that time I guess?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes, it was the Far Eastern Bureau (FE) and the “China Desk” (CA).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling at the time about the Communists and
                        the Nationalists—who was going to win, what American interests were and all
                        that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>JENKINS: We were not all of one mind, but I think we were following it very
                    closely. China language officer Jack Service wasn't there, and Oliver Edmund
                    Clubb wasn't, but two others, Phil Sprouse and Tony Freeman, were. They were my
                    bosses. We saw various options. As these dispatches came in from the China
                    posts—from Oliver Edmund Clubb, Jack Service, Bob Service, Al Siebens and
                    others- -we began to see the Nationalist side disintegrating and contemplated
                    what could be done about it.</p>
                <p>For instance, on the military side, Chiang had taken away command of ten
                    divisions—American-equipped and trained in China during the World War II—from
                    Sun Li-jen, who was a VMI graduate but just too objective— and gave the troops
                    and command to Fu Tso-yi, who had been a warlord. Fu Tso-yi eventually defected,
                    with the 10 divisions, to the Communists.</p>
                <p>And then you began to see warlord cliques develop and split off. One was the
                    Guangxi Clique, led by Li Chi-shen and Li Tsung-jen, who was vice president to
                    Chiang Kai-shek at the time. And you got a feeling from the reporting that the
                    Guangxi Clique was trying to join hands with Fu Tso-yi and Governor Lung Y�n of
                    Yunnan to provide an alternative to Chiang.</p>
                <p>So these reports poured in from the so-called China Hands. But you also had, on
                    this side, the “China Lobby,” led by John Foster Dulles and other likeminded
                    political figures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Senator Knowland, Walter Judd, who was at that time a
                        congressman.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Right. And so you could see three alternatives, at least I could, and
                    you could see people thinking about them. Should there be a support of
                    alternative groupings the Guangxi Clique and other factions? “Look, the Chinese
                    Communists are obviously winning,” others would say, “why not establish contact
                    with them, establish diplomatic relations, and wean them away from the
                    world-wide monolithic Communist movement?” And then you had the viewpoint,
                    represented by the China Lobby, “Follow through with Chiang to the very end,
                    even though he had retired to Taiwan, and someday we'll return to the mainland,”
                    which became the slogan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you feeling any particular pressure on you? I mean,
                        was this really some people sitting down and weighing these things and
                        trying to figure out what do we do? Or was there pressure to “think
                        right”?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Not from the hierarchy. No, I think there was objectivity...from my
                    point of view, and remember, I was a relatively new junior officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, no, I understand. No, but this is important to get
                        this feeling.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>JENKINS: But in the broader political environment you did have the feeling of
                    pressure from the Judds and the Knowlands that we mustn't be “traitors,” and you
                    began to feel that Jack Service and others were not exactly welcome in this
                    environment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did you have the feeling that you were getting good
                        reporting out of China?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I felt we were getting excellent balanced reporting out of China, even
                    including that wonderful jewel from Tihwa, capital of way-out Xinjiang. The
                    consul had just isolated himself out there, and the dispatches came in only once
                    every six months. And it became apparent (because I read the dispatches first)
                    that what he might be writing were chapters of a book about the situation in
                    Xinjiang. The villain of the piece was a Russian named Alexis, who lived in the
                    area. Finally, as the civil war approached its end, the consul had to pull out,
                    with his deputy who was an OSS type, through Tibet into India.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you didn't have the feeling at the time, this '48 to
                        '50 time, that you were in a bureau almost besieged by the political right
                        in the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: As a junior officer focusing on the military I was perhaps less aware of
                    the siege. But I had a feeling that Oliver Edmund Clubb, the Services and
                    others, and maybe my two bosses, Phil Sprouse and Tony Freeman, were feeling
                    this pressure a lot more than I was. Of course we all know what happened to the
                    Services; and John Patton Davies was another. And Tony Freeman, who was one of
                    the best China language officers I've ever known, of course, left the Far East
                    and became ambassador to Mexico eventually. And Phil Sprouse did go out to
                    Cambodia eventually. But their careers with China or anything important in that
                    region was ended. And you could sort of feel that by 1950.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave the China desk and go to Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, both Phil and Tony, who had been encouraging me to go to China
                    language school, realized that it was all over in China, and that young officers
                    would not serve there for many years to come. So something came up with the High
                    Commission in Germany, (HICOG), and they said, “That looks like a good
                    opportunity; if you're interested, take it.” HICOG wanted to train a group of
                    young candidates waiting to be Foreign Service Officers (FSOs), to serve in
                    Germany as Kreis Resident Officers, which in essence was to be county
                    representative for the High Commission throughout the American Zone. So after
                    family consultation, I joined 26 other FSO candidates to attend the Foreign
                    Service Institute for three months of orientation and German language study, and
                    then off to Germany.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you left about when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: We left in the spring of 1950.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you weren't on the China desk at the time of the Korean
                        War.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: No, I was not. Not until I went to Taiwan later. I was in FSI, then
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went to Germany, you were a Kreis Officer, which,
                        as I understand, was really sort of a device to get the American military
                        occupation officers out of the military occupation duty, for eventual
                        turnover, and it was thought best to civilianize this (with a lot of
                        heart-rending, because there was some pretty good billets there for the
                        military officer). So when you arrived, what were you doing? How were you
                        received, you might say? How did you work with our military, because it was
                        still an occupation at that time, and then what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, we were trying to really appreciate what we were doing while we
                    were still in FSI. And I remember that at our graduation party there were two of
                    the language instructors, husband and wife, of Saxony lower nobility. They
                    asked, “Well, what are you going to do as a resident officer?”</p>
                <p>I replied, “Well, we're going to be liaison between the U.S. military and the
                    local government, but mainly we're going to be involved in what we call a
                    reorientation program. We'll have youth programs, women's programs, film
                    programs in the school and we'll have public forums throughout the Kreis
                    (county) to get people to participate.”And she said, “Oh, you mean you're going
                    to make them democrats?”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Yeah: oh, we're going to try.”</p>
                <p>And she laughed and pointed at me and said to the others, “This young man thinks
                    he's going to make democrats out of the Germans (chuckle, chuckle).”</p>
                <p>But we got over there and we started out. We made a real try. I would say, at
                    first, the American military incumbents, who had the jobs we were taking over,
                    were very suspicious of us; they thought we were going to take over. And so the
                    relationship was not too warm at first. But a goodly number were retained in
                    HICOG as civilians. They warmed up after many began to realize, “Well, I'm not
                    being eliminated, I'll stay.” And so we branched out with them into our
                    democratization program, and occasionally “goofed”.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>I remember I was an understudy in Mannheim, actually in nearby Weinheim, and I
                    was trying to get started with the local youth organization. There was a
                    Jungenring, youth circle, which was having a fest and sport competition. The
                    chairman of the Jungenring was a very handsome, ash-blonde boy, and I cottoned
                    up to him and said, “Is there anything I can do to help?”</p>
                <p>He looked at me a bit skeptically and said, “Well, you know, we need some prizes
                    for the kids who win these races. Do you have any chocolates, candies or such
                    things?”</p>
                <p>And I replied, “Oh, sure.” And I got some D-ration bars from our military and I
                    told my driver, “Let's go over and see Herr Strasser at the old Rathaus.”</p>
                <p>The driver asked, “You know where that is?”</p>
                <p>In response to my negative reply, he said, “Well, that's where the Communists and
                    trade unions are located.”</p>
                <p>Well, it turns out that Herr Strasser was a Communist. But he had been elected by
                    all groups. protestant, catholic to be chairman of the Jungenring. And so on
                    delivering the D-ration I made my first faux pas, but it wasn't too bad, for I
                    made friends with several other youth leaders.</p>
                <p>There are other anecdotes of that type, too. But gradually, when we moved in to
                    our regular counties, which for me was Schw�bisch Halle in Baden-W�rttemberg,
                    the reorientation program took shape. And we did have our forum programs; we did
                    have our ladies' program; we worked with the youth and had a school film
                    program. It seemed to be taking hold.</p>
                <p>Now, I don't mean that we “made democrats” out of the Germans necessarily; but if
                    you look at it in the context of the broader initiatives we were pursuing— for
                    instance, the new constitution of West Germany was very carefully devised with
                    our advice, and Americans helped them a lot in establishing a democratically
                    elected parliamentary system, a federal system that was truly federal, and a
                    party election system with a five- percent rule, meaning that a party had to
                    have at least five percent in the election to be represented in Parliament,
                    which prevented a lot of the splintering characteristic of the elections in
                    Italy and France. Against the backdrop of these broader developments, what we
                    were doing in the Kreise seemed to fit in. And so my impression was that,
                    although there were a lot of problems, we were seeing eye-to-eye with them and
                    they were making progress toward democratic institutions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you got yanked back there to your China side, didn't
                        you, at that point? I have you going to Taipei from '52 to '55.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>JENKINS: We actually arrived in January '53. I was quite, quite sure I was going
                    to continue to serve in Germany for another tour. And I was transferred to the
                    political section of the High Commission (HICOG) in Bonn in the summer of
                    '52.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah, well, then let's talk a little about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, it would have to be “a little.” Because HICOG had the authority to
                    transfer us, as junior Foreign Service officers, directly from a Kreis to Bonn,
                    then notify the Department of the reassignment. But the dear administrative
                    officer didn't do it by wire, but by surface pouch. And so I was doing my first
                    job of sorting out files in the political section, when all of a sudden a cable
                    came in stating that I was being transferred to Taipei. Well, John Patton
                    Davies, the old China Hand, who was then head of the political section, wrote a
                    beautiful cable trying to retain me in Bonn. But a fatuous cable came back which
                    said that the Department feels that young officers should have a variety of
                    experiences, and since Mr. Jenkins has already served in China, the Department
                    feels he ought to go back there. There were condolences. One of my friends was
                    sorting through his cables in the file room and said, “I'm awfully sorry to see
                    you go.”</p>
                <p>I replied, “Well, Pete, it has to be, I guess.”</p>
                <p>And then, looking at a cable, he said, “I'll be damned, I'm transferred to
                    Taiwan, too!” So we went to Taiwan on the same plane.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression, before we leave that, about how
                        the civilian American side was doing, both at...well, it wasn't even an
                        embassy, it was still High Commission, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: It was formally the High Commission because the “contractual agreements”
                    negotiated with the Federal Republic were not ratified until 1955 because of
                    French opposition. But we operated as an Embassy. Within the U.S. Zone the
                    civilian American side was doing well, but internationally there were problems—
                    East-West problems with the USSR, impact of the Korean War, stalemate over the
                    “European Defense Community”, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you went to Taipei. What were you doing
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, in Taipei, my initial job, after several months training in
                    Washington, was to be administrative officer for the embassy, which I did for
                    about six, seven months. And then I replaced the person who was the
                    political-military officer, again because of my background in political-military
                    work.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation when you were there? We're talking
                        about '53 to '55, in Taiwan. I mean, the Korean War was going full blast.
                        I'm sure the wounds from the civil war had not really healed at all. How did
                        you see the situation there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, as you say, it was a pretty turbulent time in the Far East. And of
                    course we were in Taiwan with our military assistance program, and we were also
                    in Korea. And by this time mainland China was also involved in the Korean War:
                    and this had its repercussions in Taiwan. There was much emphasis on “return to
                    the mainland,” parading, training, and maneuvers to emphasize that goal. But
                    there was also some internal upheaval and competition for authority on the
                    island.</p>
                <p>I remember going over with our navy during the evacuation of the Tachen Islands.
                    Chiang Ching-kuo, the older son of Chiang Kai-shek, was there and I got to know
                    him somewhat. And then I went to Quemoy, which is just opposite Fujian Province
                    on the mainland—very close, artillery distance—with Wild Bill Donovan and
                    Maxwell Taylor to look over the situation there in terms of its viability under
                    the Nationalists. There was considerable military tension at that time.</p>
                <p>Also, there was internal tension. Chiang Ching-kuo, the older son, was having a
                    struggle with Madame Chiang and her son, Chiang Wei-kuo, for a position of power
                    and influence on Chiang Kai-shek. And it had its impact on the diplomatic corps,
                    too. For example, when Madame Chiang organized a fashion show, supported by
                    Wei-kuo, and invited all the diplomats there, Ching-kuo surreptitiously got his
                    bully boys to disrupt the fashion show, turnover diplomats' vehicles, while
                    appealing to the public that the fashion show was a frivolous event at the time
                    of serious civil and Korean war with the Communists.</p>
                <p>Also, Sun Li-Jen, the VMI-educated general who trained the troops that finally
                    opened up the Burma Road during W.W.II, was put under house arrest in 1954. And
                    two of his generals were sent to Green Island, a detention re-education camp for
                    political prisoners. I remember going to Green Island with a U.S. Army colleague
                    and Chiang Ching-kuo, who controlled security for the Nationalist Government.
                    During the tour of the camp he pointed out that they were reforming the resident
                    political dissidents, and that ninety-five percent of them, after re-education
                    in the Three People's Principles, returned to Taiwan. Well, that was interesting
                    so my colleague and I asked, “Well, what happens to the other five percent?”</p>
                <p>“Oh, we don't hurt them. No, actually, we give them a boat, food supplies and a
                    radio, and send them back to the Chinese mainland. And after three or four days,
                    we start sending radio messages to them asking: “When are you going to report?'
                    And the Communists take care of them.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, my God.</hi>

                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, he was a very, very clever man. But he was also very clever in a
                    more positive sense: he cultivated the Taiwanese and supported their
                    involvement, developing close relation with them, and not relying exclusively on
                    the mainlanders resident on Taiwan.</p>
                <p>Involving the native Taiwanese brings me to the one real positive development
                    during this period. We Americans helped develop a Joint Commission for Rural
                    Reconstruction (JCRR), headed by Chiang Mon-lin, a former university president
                    on the mainland, an inspired, far-sighted person. In essence, JCRR emulated what
                    happened in Japan back at the time of the late 19th century Meiji Restoration,
                    during which land was taken from the feudal lords and dispensed to the
                    peasantry. Similarly, land was taken from the wealthy landowners in Taiwan and
                    given to the peasants, and the government reimbursed the landlords with
                    government bonds. They became the bankers and the industrialists, just like the
                    Mitsubishis and other feudal lords in Japan back during the Meiji Restoration.
                    This JCRR development laid the foundation for the fantastic economic development
                    that has occurred over the past few decades on Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Karl Rankin was the ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: He was our ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Karl Rankin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: My impression was, he was a nice, even handed person, and he was like
                    several other ambassadors with whom I have served, believing that you don't
                    muddy up the waters. I mean they emphasize that this is the policy—the way we're
                    going to do it. To illustrate, I recall one fascinating report prepared jointly
                    by officers of the Political Section. It was a despatch analyzing the
                    feasibility of a military “return to the mainland,” concluding that it was most
                    unlikely. It was drafted by FSO China-language experts and sent up to the
                    ambassador. He recognized a problem, with the “China Lobby” now pretty much in
                    control in the Department. He left the analysis intact but changed the
                    conclusions—this was his report. But the underlying message stood out when it
                    got back to the Department, because the analysis was still there. Ambassador
                    Rankin tried to be fair to his reporting officers and at the same time avoid
                    rocking the boat in Washington. All copies of the report were recalled from
                    distribution by the Department</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any feeling at the time, particularly when you
                        got into the political-military side, that this idea of returning to the
                        mainland just was a non-starter from the very beginning?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes, and I think that most of the political officers, economic officers
                    and most everyone in the embassy felt the same way; but “return to the mainland”
                    like many other slogans of autocratic leaders, seems to help hold things
                    together.</p>
                <p>I just read in The New York Times, day before yesterday, about Mr. Wu, an elderly
                    Kuomintang legislator, still taking the line, “We're going to return to the
                    mainland in a few years.”</p>
                <p>Such slogans tended to hold the mainlanders together in a disciplined fashion;
                    and they had their impressive military parades, and we trained them and gave
                    them equipment to maintain the unified posture. So, while I think the analysts
                    thought it was a non-starter, I also concluded that it had its politically
                    unifying purpose among the mainlanders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel under any sort of constraints, at least among
                        the Chinese, not to say, “Oh, come on, fellas, this isn't going to work.”? I
                        mean, was this something we talked about among ourselves, but there was no
                        point in displaying our thoughts to the Chinese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I'm trying to think if I ever had an opportunity. No, I don't think that
                    we were ever inclined to do that. We wanted our government to know what we felt
                    about the possibility. We had pretty close associations with some people like
                    General Sun Li-Jen and others we had known back during the war, and they didn't
                    seem to believe in the feasibility of a military return to the mainland. But you
                    didn't discuss such things with Chiang Ching-kuo or other inside members of the
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Chiang Kai-shek, Madame Chiang
                        and all, as far as their grasp of how to run the government? You know, one
                        always thinks of the tremendous corruption. You've talked about the device
                        of the cliquism. Was there a reform going on within their ranks at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, as I said, it's a very strange source of reform, but Chiang's
                    older son, Ching-kuo, who was, after all, educated in Moscow, took all of the
                    Communist techniques, developed them for the Kuomintang against the Communists.
                    Now that's one side of him. But, as I said, I think under his influence there
                    was a tendency, demonstrated by the JCRR land reform, to compensate the
                    Taiwanese with economic prosperity in exchange for maintaining Kuomintang
                    political and military control. That was my impression by the time I left. And
                    Ching-kuo was very good at it; that was his technique: Cultivate the Taiwanese
                    economically, maintain political and military control.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there during the sacking of the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>JENKINS: I left, fortunately, three months before that. But it was the same group
                    that was turning over the diplomats' cars at the fashion show, and I think it
                    was Ching-kuo who was a little bit behind that, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was over a...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: It involved an American sergeant who, as I recall, caught a “Peeping
                    Tom” outside his house and shot him with a .45. Wasn't that it, the way you
                    think it was started?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was something like that, yes. Well, then, you
                        seemed to have a sort of a split personality here. You left Taipei and back
                        again to Berlin. You were there from '55 to '57. What were you doing in
                        Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: With Berlin, I fought my way back to Germany. Initially I had been
                    reassigned to Hong Kong, and I said...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to get a little of the thought process to
                        understand the career. I mean, here you are, you're a junior officer, but
                        not that junior, and you're looking for a career field and all. With your
                        Far East Asian experience, you were trying really to get out from under
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, I sort of took what Phil Sprouse and Tony Freeman had said as
                    true. When I first went in and wanted to be in China, we had fourteen posts on
                    the mainland, and I could just see my career, three-fourths of it, circulating
                    in these posts in China, in Hong Kong and so forth. But it was quite obvious at
                    the end of the civil war that they were right and there were very few
                    opportunities to serve on the mainland. Al Jenkins, no relation, finally made it
                    back; but that was many years later.</p>
                <p>Well, is there an alternative? I thought Germany and Central Europe would be a
                    good alternative, and my first taste of it as Resident Officer bore this out. So
                    I decided to stick with that. I'd had this basic experience with the High
                    Commission and had learned the language.</p>
                <p>So they did send me to Berlin, which was wonderful. And I became a member of what
                    was called the Eastern Element of the U.S. Mission in Berlin. The Eastern
                    Element was concerned primarily with East Germany. So fundamentally what we did
                    was, we had liaison with the Soviets. We also traveled widely throughout East
                    Germany and spent a lot of time in East Berlin getting a feel for the
                    environment and so forth. But this again was the beginning of a pretty turbulent
                    period in Central Europe, the build-up to the 1956 Hungarian uprising.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. Well now, first, just a little organizational
                        thing. What was the Berlin mission's relation to our embassy? By that time
                        it was an embassy in Bonn, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes. The Contractual Agreements were formally ratified in 1955.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, actually the title of the chief of the U.S. Mission in Berlin was
                    that he was sort of the deputy to the U.S. military commander, who was part of
                    the tripartite control of the western allied sectors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tripartite—French, British...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: French, British, and American. Then you had the quadripartite, the
                    Soviets over there. And he was really, formally, to fit into the legal aspect, a
                    deputy to this commander. But he was also, obviously, the liaison with our
                    embassy in Bonn, the political-economic link. He had that function, plus liaison
                    between the U.S. military and the Berlin civilian population and government.
                    There was an economic section, political section, consular section and so forth,
                    but the Eastern Element had a special sort of liaison function and a reporting
                    function regarding developments in East Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it a problem in those days going into East Germany,
                        East Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: There was no problem whatsoever going into East Berlin. You drove, got
                    on the subway, or walked over from the Kurfuerstendam. And there were a lot of
                    things to do there. I mean, they had one of the best symphony orchestras. They
                    had a fantastic opera and comic opera. They had the wonderful theater, Bert
                    Brecht Theater, on the Schiftbauerdamm. And so we went to those a lot, plus
                    several East Europeans cultural and art shops, where you could buy cheaply
                    recordings, manuscripts, art and so forth. We spent a lot of time there; very
                    easy to go back and forth.</p>
                <p>Over time, something was developed between the Eastern Element and Soviet
                    representatives in East Berlin. We met with them socially from time to time and
                    there gradually evolved a deal: “Look, we'll give travel permits to each other,
                    tit for tat, so you all can travel any time you want to in western Germany. Just
                    let us know in advance. And then you let us travel in eastern Germany.”</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>And so there was quite a bit of travel. The Leipzig Fair was one of the big
                    attractions, but also we wanted to go to Dresden, to Chemnitz, which was
                    Karl-Marxstadt then. Through such travel we got an intimate feel for the
                    situation in the East.</p>
                <p>I think my strongest appreciation of the political and economic climate was
                    obtained on a return auto trip from Austria. It was October, and we purposely
                    stopped in Weimar on the way back to Berlin to have an opportunity to over-night
                    there. Well, we got there thinking we were going to stay in the Premier Hotel
                    Elefant; but it was hosting a conference; so they put us up with a private
                    family. We spent the night in a greenhouse, of all things, and it was right
                    chilly in October. After showing us our “accommodations,” the hostess said, “You
                    come up to us after you've had dinner; we are having some friends in.” So we
                    went up, and they were all listening to the radio: the uprising in Budapest had
                    started! And they were listening entranced, and that was one of the most
                    fascinating social evenings my wife Laura and I have ever spent abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about the October '56 uprising in
                        Hungary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: October '56 uprising. One minute our hosts would be joyous, and then
                    they would start crying, because they remembered their own failed June 17 (1953)
                    uprising in East Berlin.</p>
                <p>Q; This was in 1953.</p>
                <p>JENKINS: Fifty-three, right. And so it was happiness and sadness. They knew the
                    Hungarian uprising wasn't going to succeed. But then they went on talking about
                    their attitudes towards the situation in East Germany; and it was very
                    interesting. There was a dentist there, a druggist, and they were saying, “You
                    know, a lot of good things have happened in East Germany.” They praised
                    collective agriculture (none of them were farmers). They thought a lot had been
                    done in education, more people got a chance to be educated for meaningful jobs.
                    They thought that everybody had a job and at least had basic economic security.
                    But then they would turn bitter and say, “But it's those bastards, Ulbricht and
                    his ilk; we can't stand the leadership.” So, although they would accept things
                    that were going on, they turned their hatred against the leadership, which I
                    found rather interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, following through on the '56 uprising, I mean, this
                        was a pretty tense time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: It sure was.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was the consular officer in Frankfurt at the time, and I
                        remember we were sort of trying to figure out, well, if this thing really
                        blows up, how to get the American civilians out of there, which were 100,000
                        in Hesse, I think, or something like that. How did you all deal with the
                        Hungarian uprising and the situation at the time, once you got back, from
                        the Berlin perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, as you say, it was a tense situation, because, although under
                    Khrushchev there had been the Twentieth Party Congress and its criticism of
                    Stalin, the Soviet government under Khrushchev began to come apart. And you
                    didn't have just the Hungarian uprising, you had the Poznan uprising in Poland
                    as well in 1956. And that had to be put down, not by the Russians, but by the
                    Poles themselves. You also had a tremendous exodus of young East Germans to the
                    west, and this was a prelude to the Wall a few years later (1961). And so you
                    had a very unstable situation.</p>
                <p>But we not only had a pretty good, confident Mission and military, together with
                    the Brits and the French, but also we had a mayor, a very interesting guy named
                    Willy Brandt.</p>
                <p>And I remember that on Sunday, right after the Hungarian uprising, I had been
                    “culture-shopping” in eastern Berlin. Driving back, I noticed there was
                    something very, very strange going on. At the Brandenburger Tor and all along
                    the sector border there were armored vehicles with water cannons. The East
                    Berlin Volpos (Volkspolizei), were there with their Tommy guns. And coming down
                    the main road of West Berlin, then called the Seventeenth of June, were hordes
                    of students who intended to march right through the Brandenburger Tor. West
                    Berlin University students, of a very different stripe from what they became
                    some twenty years later. And they were going to go through the Brandenburger Tor
                    to protest what had been done to the Hungarians. Well, I was looking at this,
                    and then I saw a guy get up on a soapbox and stop them and talk to them. It was
                    Willy Brandt. Youthful West Berlin motorcyclists were going by and putting roses
                    in the gun barrels of the Volpos. And those assembled students were ready to go;
                    there were thousands of them. And Mayor Brandt got up on the soapbox and talked
                    them out of it. I gained great respect for Willy Brandt, the future West German
                    Bundeskanzler.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because had they gone there, there would have been a
                        slaughter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Oh, there would have really been a slaughter. It was a Sunday, and I
                    dashed back in to tell my boss, Dave Henry, and he said, “Write it up.” I did,
                    and he said, “That's great. Now we don't have any secretaries or anybody on
                    Sunday, so type it up and you can take it to be transmitted.”</p>
                <p>“But Dave, I can't type.”</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>He said, “You can't type? I don't see how you got as far as you have.” So he
                    typed it. But it was a pretty good report.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, what about your relations with the
                        Soviets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Soviet relations in those Berlin days were very, very tentative. We got
                    together merely to bargain about trips and so forth and so on, and talk about
                    things. And they would try to get us drunk with vodka. Sometimes we did drink a
                    little bit too much, and when we had them over, we'd try them out with bourbon
                    and so forth. The relationships basically were an exchange of permits to travel
                    and drunken parties, quite frankly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your relations with the U.S. military at the
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: The U.S. military at the time. We all shared “occupation” housing, you
                    know. We lived next door to various military families, and we were all in a
                    community, very close. We had social life together. On policy matters, we would
                    consult with them. We had no disagreements that I recall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not sure if he was there at the same time, probably
                        somewhat later, or maybe earlier, Arthur Day?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Pete Day. No, he wasn't there, but later I replaced him in the
                    Secretariat at the State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In an interview, he was saying that there were a lot of
                        incidents. Our troops would patrol over in East Berlin, and he reluctantly
                        found that they could trust the Soviet complaints more than they could
                        accept the U.S. military excuse or story. We're talking about sergeants, you
                        know, Jeep drivers getting in incidents. We'd call it today sort of
                        cowboy-like behavior. And this was a real bone of contention. Did you have
                        any of that problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Quite frankly I don't recall any of that at the time we were there.
                    Berlin sector problems were handled by another section of the Mission. I've
                    forgotten when Pete was there, but I know conflicts became a very real factor in
                    inter-zonal travel later on, including a shooting in Potsdam, as you might
                    recall. But at our time, although they were turbulent times internationally, the
                    main effort of our Eastern Element was zonal analysis: “You give us the right to
                    travel in your zone, and we'll give you permission to visit ours.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel, while you were in Berlin at that time,
                        about “the Soviet menace”? I mean, did you feel that this was a pistol that
                        was cocked that might go off at any time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Basically, I did not think this nearly as much as I did when I was a
                    Resident Officer (1950-52) when the Korean War started and we reinforced our
                    troops. In our little town of Schw�bisch Halle, the U.S. troop strength was
                    tripled. I saw it more as a beginning of turbulence in the Soviet bloc. Not
                    something that would necessarily mean an invasion of the West, but things like
                    putting down the Poznan uprising, the Hungarian uprising, stricter discipline in
                    eastern Germany and so forth. I saw it as a problem that Khrushchev was having,
                    to take what had been a 1956 opening of liberalization—Gomulka replacing Beirut
                    and the reactionaries in Poland, for example. The Soviets were having problems,
                    but I didn't see it as a threat to the West at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were relations with the embassy, by the way? Did you
                        find that you were reporting one world and they were reporting another, or
                        were you pretty much in synchronization?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I don't remember any contradictions. I just think the Eastern Element
                    was seeing things on the ground and reporting it, and I thought that the embassy
                    accepted that first-hand knowledge. I do remember one interesting anomaly. There
                    was some discussion at one of the staff meetings about Yugoslavia as an example
                    of change in the Communist bloc. And then I remember Bernard Gufler, the head of
                    the U.S. Mission, said, “Now, listen, I want everyone to understand there is no
                    difference between Communists. And I don't want anybody in this Mission to be
                    giving the impression that they believe there is any difference between
                    Communists.” So there were some people who had a pretty standard view of what
                    the problem was out there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here you were, reporting and all. Did you feel like the
                        CIA was out there fiddling with trying to create unrest? I mean, were they
                        sort of doing their thing and you were doing your thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, our thing, remember we weren't working with the economic or
                    political sections of the Berlin Mission. We were focusing on what was happening
                    over there. Yes, I saw a number of things; they did seem to be “fiddling”. There
                    was at this time a huge exodus of young East Germans. And of course there were
                    places all over West Berlin for interviewing the departees. Also, whenever there
                    were political events or parades in East Berlin, there were balloons that would
                    float over with messages from our side. We could see the effort, but I did not
                    feel at that time that they were doing anything excessive to exacerbate a
                    situation that was taking place anyway. Of course, Radio Free Europe (RFE) was
                    pretty well tuned into the situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Radio Free Europe. Well, then you left Berlin in 1957, and
                        I have you, my God, going back to Harvard again. You couldn't get out of
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I couldn't get out of there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, I took the advanced course in international law and relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like something you'd need like a hole in the
                        head.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, I've got to be very frank; what I was doing was very useful, and I
                    had a number of friends and colleagues who went, too. Actually, I was working on
                    my Ph.D. thesis. We had courses with Kissinger and Brzezinski, who were both
                    professors there at that time, and I would do papers for them, chapters on East
                    Germany that were supposed to complete the Ph.D. thesis. But I must confess that
                    when the 1957-58 year at Harvard was over I didn't quite have it finished; and I
                    never finished it. But that's what I was up to there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Probably there are more unfinished Ph.D. theses than...
                        Well, then you went to be a political officer at the Department, after a
                        year there, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I came back and went to the Executive Secretariat. That was '58.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Fifty-eight, '59, '60.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Pete Day was there then, and he and I worked together. They didn't have
                    a twenty- four-hour Operations Center in the Secretariat then. Initially I was
                    the apprentice early-morning top-secret summary editor under Pete. When he left,
                    I took over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was still during the shank-end of the Eisenhower
                        era.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes, and we did the early-morning top-secret summary for the Secretary,
                    with distribution to the White House, Defense and other key agencies. Then we
                    did the afternoon summary for the bureaus, and the monthly bulletin for
                    circulation to the posts abroad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the Departmental and inter-
                        departmental politics at all in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes, I did somewhat. I must confess, however, that basically, since I
                    remained editor for the whole two years of my assignment, and since I had to be
                    in there at 2:30 every morning, I was focusing more on what was happening in the
                    world than on the infighting. I think members of the Secretariat who worked
                    specifically with other departments and with bureaus of State, got a much better
                    feel for this than I did. But you could feel a little interaction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, after all, you were editing the document that's
                        going to end up as breakfast reading for the top people in the
                        government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Right, I had to watch my spelling.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I would think, though, that there would be all sorts
                        of pressures on you to get what people wanted to. I mean, you know, the
                        whole idea is to get the ear of the man or the woman in power. And I would
                        think that you would feel, well, we've got to get this item in or something
                        like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I must confess I didn't feel this. My most poignant memory was of the
                    first early morning I was editor. You sit up there alone in this quiet place.
                    And then these vacuum tube capsules come plopping down carrying embassy cables
                    which you sort out for summary items. Then your two writers, young talented
                    FSOs, come in and write them. After these capsules started plopping down that
                    first morning and I opened one up, I discovered that the king of Iraq had been
                    assassinated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would have been July 14, 1958.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: You got it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: And, boy, then they started falling from all over the Middle East, and
                    it was very, very exciting. But my two writers didn't show. And so I finally
                    called Nancy Rawls's apartment, and the other young male writer...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was later ambassador to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: A post in Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>And the young man, who was in the apartment lobby, said, “Well, Nancy isn't up
                    yet.”</p>
                <p>I replied, “Well, wake her up and come on in, we've got work to do.”</p>
                <p>So I was writing Iraq items with one hand and sorting additional stories with the
                    other. Then they arrived and we got it whipped into shape. But that was the big
                    news for the day. That was one of the main crisis situations I remember from
                    those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you then moved sort of a little farther to the east
                        and took Polish training, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes. During my tour in Berlin, I had driven a car to our Embassy at
                    Warsaw for our Poznan Fair pavilion. I met Dick Johnson there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Richard...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Richard E. Johnson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There are a lot of different Johnsons.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: He was one of three Johnsons at the Warsaw Embassy then. Richard E. was
                    with the political section. These were very interesting times in Poland,
                    because, as I say, not much earlier there had been a Poznan uprising, and things
                    were moving in Poland. Well, Dick and the visit generally interested me in
                    Poland, and so I applied for language training. And after nine months of
                    language training at FSI, we went to Poznan, Poland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Poznan, where you served from 1961 to '63.
                        What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, I went to Poznan as the principal officer of the consulate
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is a consulate.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: It's a consulate. It had been formed in Poznan, I think, for two
                    reasons. One was, it had been the center of the uprising that was put down in
                    1956, and it also is in the heart of the Polish western territories, which had
                    been formerly German. It was a very good place to get a feel for the environment
                    and the tendencies in that region.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of a staff did you have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: A modest staff, but a very good staff. I had an excellent secretary,
                    Jackie Mathy. And I had a wonderful vice consul, Sol Polansky, who later became
                    ambassador to Bulgaria. And Jerry Verner was the talented USIA vice consul. And
                    then, as for as local employees, it was small, modest. But the first year, we
                    didn't issue a single visa. I was surprised; I thought it would give us much
                    better contact. Finally, we did get permission to issue visas. So it was a small
                    local staff, too, of about three clerical, one being Pani Czartoryska, who was
                    the wife of Adam Czartoryski, scion of the old Polish nobility. She's still an
                    old friend. And then a driver and a janitor. And that was it. We had to get
                    another person once we started issuing visas to help us. Small, but a very good
                    staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you weren't issuing visas for most of the time. How'd
                        you operate? What were your sort of goals and what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I have to preface all this by saying that Americans are very popular
                    with the Poles— everybody has a cousin in Detroit or Chicago; so we did
                    cultivate a lot of friends. And we traveled a lot, made contacts with the yacht
                    club in Szczecin; and the editor of the newspaper there, who was a hunter and
                    invited us to go hunting; and down in Wroclaw (Breslau) was mayor Ostapczuk, and
                    a Politburo member, Wladislaw Matwin. We made very good connections with all
                    these people and many in cultural fields in Poznan as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was sort of a window of openness, wasn't it, this
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, it began to shut down a little later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes. Well, you see, the openness came in the late fifties, and you could
                    already feel it coming down, but there was still, especially in cultural and
                    other fields, much more liberalism than we had detected, say, in East Germany.
                    And, as I say, the Poles were so fond of Americans that... I'll give you one
                    example. Sol Polansky was driving down to Wroclaw in his new Volkswagen which
                    still had oval temporary German plates. It stopped running part way down to
                    Wroclaw and the Poles started coming out of the fields to observe. Sol lifted up
                    the back hood—but he wasn't a mechanic. And they were all looking at him but not
                    offering any help. They spoke to him in German. And Sol kept answering in
                    Polish. Finally one of them said, “You know, you're the first German I've ever
                    met who can speak Polish.”</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>And he said, “I'm not German, I'm American.”</p>
                <p>“You're an American! Well, come on in, my son is a mechanic, and have breakfast
                    with us.”</p>
                <p>This contrast, it was amazing.</p>
                <p>And so we had easy contacts. We had, of course, our Fourth of July party, we had
                    a Halloween party, we had a Valentine party, and we always had scores of guests.
                    It was terrific.</p>
                <p>And at the graduation in the universities...I never will forget the one in, I
                    guess it was '62. We went first to the agricultural university. I was
                    introduced, and they all got up and gave a standing ovation. Not for me
                    personally, but because I was the American consul. So at the next university
                    ceremony, they introduced the Soviet and American consuls simultaneously—there
                    was modest applause. At the third (Technical) university graduation, they didn't
                    mention that either one of us was there.</p>
                <p>And then, when the Eastman Orchestra from Rochester came to play at the symphony,
                    I invited the mayor to go with me. We sat down on the second row. Well into the
                    program the Eastman Orchestra started playing the “Stars and Stripes Forever.”
                    The Poles all got up and marched and paraded and danced up and down the aisles.
                    Very embarrassing for the mayor and I was a little embarrassed, but I enjoyed
                    it.</p>
                <p>But this was the atmosphere, explaining one's ability to associate and learn
                    things from the people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, tell me, I mean, you were there in '61. As I recall,
                        just about '61, we had this, at that time, rather bad incident at our
                        embassy, where a General Services officer had an affair with a Polish woman
                        who was connected to the Polish secret police and all that, and ended up in
                        jail.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I had almost forgotten about that, but I remember now. It was just
                    before our arrival in Poznan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I remember that because I was offered a job to go to
                        Poland to be General Services officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: You should have gone.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it was just after this happened, and I didn't feel
                        like replacing, doing... But how about the feeling about the Polish secret
                        police and all? Because you might have had these other relations, but there
                        was this other side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: It was always there. And if you were a balanced person, and I think we
                    were and our team was, it was habitual to appreciate that the police were
                    following you en route to Szczecin. You always knew that phones and rooms were
                    “bugged;” you always assumed this when you were talking on the phone or
                    conversing with anyone. And you behaved accordingly. But there were some
                    exceptions, you see, like the General Services officer. And, later, when I went
                    to Warsaw, there were several other cases that had occurred. But we assumed that
                    it would occur.</p>
                <p>I'll give you one example. A very good friend of mine was a Dr. Powiertowski, and
                    he told me, “You know, every time we're together I have to report to the police.
                    Now you know that, so if you don't want to associate with me, don't. But if you
                    know that, then you might know how to behave.” And we were both fishermen who
                    enjoyed going fishing together; so we continued association.</p>
                <p>We usually knew who they were. I remember we found out some of the key people in
                    the community were actually officers in the UB (Polish Security Service). After
                    learning this, we continued our association with them. Knowing who they were and
                    how they would behave was the important thing. But they were always there.</p>
                <p>It was your staff. For instance, Pan Josef was the consulate janitor. And one
                    time there was a break-in in the consulate. He had a dual feeling; I mean, he
                    really protected us a great deal. And he caught the intruder, who was turned
                    over to the police. Well, it turned out that this guy was an UB operative, who
                    was coming in to check and repair the nine mikes in the consulate. And we knew
                    Pan Josef was also UB. But he didn't know the one he caught was UB, one of his
                    own guys. And so the nine mikes were uncovered as a result. You just knew that
                    they (the UB) were there all the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, all of a sudden were dainty Polish women being
                        dangled in front of you or your staff, or something like this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes. It happened before I got there, but there were some families, who
                    we continued to associate with, who had young men as sons who were sort of
                    cottoning up to our secretary. But, before I got there, the consulate learned
                    who these people were, and so she was extremely careful and didn't associate
                    except when we were all together. But in Warsaw this happened quite a bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much contact with, say, Polish officials
                        around there? I mean, did you go talk to them, and did they talk about the
                        situation? Or was it pretty much a pro forma contact?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Locally, in Poznan itself, it was tough, because we had one of the
                    hardest-line First Secretaries in Poland, and his name was Jan Szydlak. And
                    there was no real communication with him. But if you got to any of the other
                    towns, gradually a pretty good relationship developed. Because it was one of the
                    jobs of those, let's say, in Szczecin, Wroclaw, or Jelenia G�ra, places like
                    that, to get us to accept the western territories as belonging to Poland. And so
                    they would take us on tours and show us the “wonderful things” the Poles had
                    done in this region. So you got quite close to a number of the Party and
                    government officials.</p>
                <p>For instance, in Wroclaw, the old Breslau, the mayor was Ostapczuk. He was an
                    extremely liberal guy, he wanted close relations, and he arranged a lot of
                    tours. And one time when I went down on a visit he said, “You know, someone
                    wants to talk to you. You know Matwin, the Party First Secretary?”</p>
                <p>And I replied, “Yes, he's also on the Politburo.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Yes, well, he wants to talk to you.”</p>
                <p>And so I said, “(gulp) Okay, let's go.”</p>
                <p>The car came, picked me up, and took me over to... Matwin, a fascinating person.
                    He had graduated from Charles University in Prague. He was one of the very
                    liberal element that had come in with Gomulka in '56. We talked for three hours.
                    He had a desk, and he didn't sit at the desk, it was standup desk. And we talked
                    about the situation in Poland and, you know, not once did he mention anything
                    about Marx or Lenin, but he constantly cited Spinoza, the philosopher. And he
                    was asking me how we liked Wroclaw and this beautiful western territory; but he
                    wasn't grilling me on anything that had to do with American politics or military
                    or anything like that. He was again promoting our interest in the western
                    territories.</p>
                <p>But as things began to crack down, after I left Poznan and became Polish desk
                    officer in the Department, both Owstapczuk and Matwin were removed by the
                    hard-liners, and the tightening-up process accelerated. Remember, 1961 was
                    Berlin Wall. Poznan is closer to Berlin than it is to Warsaw; and there were ink
                    marks all over the walls and broken windows of our consulate, which happened
                    right after the Berlin Wall went up. So things were beginning to tighten up
                    again while we were there.</p>
                <p>And then came the Cuban missile crisis, October '62. It happened, and of all
                    things, we had as our cultural guest Monroe Leaf, who wrote Ferdinand the Bull.
                    He was with us, he was our guest and staying with us, and we had a big program
                    at the library for him. But the missile crisis intervened, and only three people
                    showed up. So it was a pretty tense moment.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm interested in this, because I've had some interviews
                        with people who were in Moscow at the same time, where there were crowds,
                        and obviously the crowds were so-called demonstrating against the embassy,
                        but mainly they were concerned and wanted to know what the hell was
                        happening. You know, this was not a hostile crowd, these were very concerned
                        people. What were you getting in Poland at that time? Because it looked like
                        there might be a war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: That's right, it was tense. And we got reflections from Warsaw,
                    particularly, that they were very concerned there. But I didn't find that the
                    local population or even most officials in our consular district were
                    anti-American or anything like that. They were concerned. And I guess we were
                    all concerned.</p>
                <p>We were pretty isolated in Poznan and were living in a three-story consulate
                    building. My secretary had the top floor that looked out over the railroad. I
                    said, “Jackie, you watch and if you see any trains heading west, with a lot of
                    tanks and guns on them, we'll let the embassy know.” And I guess it was Carol
                    Brown then who was the vice consul, Sol had moved on. “Carol, why don't you take
                    a car and make a swing down to the south and out to the west, and if you see any
                    real action, we can report it. Meanwhile, Laura and I are going up to Szczecin
                    to the yacht club and tell our friends up there we'd like to take a little
                    cruise.”</p>
                <p>In Szczecin they said sure, come on. And we went up, and we went out in a sail
                    boat. Of course, they didn't take us anywhere near the harbor, but they
                    entertained us very nicely with all kinds of Polish ham and vodka. And then, of
                    all things, here we were on a sailing cruise and it started snowing. Here we
                    were, cruising around in the estuary in the snow, and didn't see a thing. But I
                    guess not seeing anything was reassuring. So we came back.</p>
                <p>And then the aftermath was, I think, very interesting. We had already put out an
                    invitation to our Halloween party. Usually, as I say, we had eighty or so people
                    there—only six showed up. Five of them we knew were UB, the secret police. One
                    was an innocent student, who as a result got into trouble, but not serious
                    trouble. I later asked him, “Which one do you think it was that turned you
                    in?”</p>
                <p>He said, “I think it was that one with the Napoleon hat.” Guests wore costumes to
                    the Halloween party</p>
                <p>We knew which one that was.</p>
                <p>So that was the first reaction: local citizens were afraid, but they weren't
                    against us.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>But the real showdown came a few days later...because I'd already accepted the
                    invitation to the November 7 reception of the Soviet consulate. Well, they
                    didn't think I was going to come, but Laura and I went. And the Soviet hosts
                    were very hesitant, but they had to let us in. So we went up into the reception
                    hall, with all the local leaders and cultural types there. And every time a Pole
                    came up to talk to us, one of the vice consuls would come and say, “Oh, I want
                    to introduce you to this visiting Soviet guest,” and we were isolated. Finally,
                    however, Danuta Satanowski, who was a leading actress in town, wouldn't take
                    this sort of thing, and she came over and started talking to us. She wouldn't go
                    away with them. And then she called her husband, who was the director of the
                    symphony orchestra, Satanowski, and he came over and talked to us. Then the
                    university presidents and others came. Pretty soon we were right back in the
                    middle of it.</p>
                <p>I'm using this event to illustrate that the Poles were concerned, but they were
                    still very friendly and they were positive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it was a difficult time. Did you get any requests
                        from Polish-Americans in the United States about Uncle So and So at this
                        time? I would think that you would be doing a lot of family services for
                        Polish- Americans.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, as I say, the first half of the tour in Poznan, we didn't issue
                    visas or do much regular consular work. We got into a little bit of that in the
                    last half of the tour. But, no, I sensed this much more, later, when I was on
                    the desk and also when I was in Warsaw. But in Poznan, in 1961-62, we didn't
                    have a feeling that we were running errands for Polish-Americans. But later,
                    while I was Polish Desk Officer, 1966 was the millennium of the Polish state and
                    the Polish church. And that was the main focus in the Polish-American community,
                    because it represented the unity of church and state. You had a lot more
                    Polish-American goings-on at that time than you did back in '61 to '63.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you came back to the Department in 1964, is that
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Sixty-three. Oh, then I had to go to the Naval War College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to the Naval War College for a year, and then you
                        were Polish desk officer, '64 to '66. What were the main things that you did
                        as the desk officer in this particular period of time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I think the two things that stand out most in my mind were: one, the
                    latter half, '66, was, as I say, the millennium of the Polish church and state.
                    And you had a lot of things going on with the Polish-American community in
                    trying to promote the importance of this occasion and how important the church
                    was in Poland, including the Rose Garden ceremonies and so forth.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rose Garden at the White House.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: At the White House, yes. And helping edit their speeches. I was rather
                    surprised, because the Polish- American speech writers were depicting Mary as
                    God in Poland. I mean, she was referred to as God. I'm a Methodist, and I said,
                    “Is that really true?” And so they edited it down a little bit—Mother of
                    God.</p>
                <p>But this was the dominant thing. And it was also the period when we sent a
                    congressional delegation to Poland that wanted to capitalize on the millennium
                    atmosphere and dedicate a children's hospital down in Krakow. I went over with
                    them as a guide, and observed that there was a great effort by the congressmen
                    to express the feeling of the sympathy on the part of American public for the
                    Polish people. The millennium was one of the dominant features of that
                    period.</p>
                <p>The second dominant feature was the problem that began with the crack-down of the
                    Soviets and the Americans on each other. The Soviets had put a lot of areas off
                    limits for American travel in the Soviet Union, and we retaliated. And then we
                    retaliated against the Poles, too, because they were compelled to follow the
                    Soviet example. Certain areas in the U.S. were placed “off limits.”. And so they
                    set Lublin, where the Catholic university is, off limits. And this started a
                    series of related problems, because our military attach�s would get into trouble
                    sometimes in these areas. And the Poles then started a series of PNG actions
                    against the attach�s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: PNG is to make them persona non grata.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes. And so they would PNG one of ours, meaning their expulsion from
                    Poland, and we'd PNG one of theirs. And this went on and on until they were down
                    to only two attach�s and we were down to four. There seemed to be no way to stop
                    it. Even though I thought we should put this aside and get on with something
                    else, it just kept happening. And the embassy at that time seemed to favor the
                    PNG, “Let's be tough and get rid of them.”</p>
                <p>So my two years were dominated mostly, I think, by the millennium, the problem of
                    the closed areas and the PNGing of attach�s. And I was sort of glad that I was
                    selected to be DCM in Warsaw to get out of that atmosphere, hoping it would not
                    be getting out of the frying pan into the fire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You served in Warsaw as deputy chief of mission, DCM, from
                        1966 to '70. How did you get the job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, John Gronouski was appointed ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A Democrat under Johnson.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: He was the Postmaster General, and I think Johnson for domestic
                    political reasons wanted to get somebody else into that job. They seemed to
                    conclude, “Gronouski has worked effectively with the Polish-American community.
                    There's going to be a vacancy in Warsaw, let's make him ambassador.” As Polish
                    Desk Officer, I had some liaison with him at the time, went over to his office
                    occasionally and so he asked the Department to appoint me as his Deputy (DCM).
                    But Bud Sherer's term was not up in Warsaw, and so it was six months later that
                    I actually went in. The sixties were my Polish years, from '61 to '70, and I was
                    very happy to do it. John Gronouski was a capable, intelligent person, and
                    things were very interesting in Poland at that time. So we hit it off and I
                    served as his DCM from July 1966 until late 1967, when he returned to reenter
                    politics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as a professional Foreign Service officer, one
                        always has a certain reservation about somebody, particularly coming from
                        the political world as Gronouski did, who is of ethnic stock from the
                        country where they are going. There's a tendency to try to return to the
                        homeland, to run for mayor and these things, to turn sort of over-ethnic or
                        something. How did Gronouski work, looking at it with a cold, clear
                        eye?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: He was a very intelligent man who had been a professor. And until he
                    entered politics he didn't fully appreciate that he was Polish—his mother was
                    Irish, and he had been raised as an Irish Catholic. And when Kennedy said he
                    needed someone to help, you know, round up the Polish-American community, he
                    thought of Gronouski. And Gronouski said, “I guess I am Polish.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he didn't really come from a Polish background.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, his father was of Polish heritage, but because of maternal
                    influence, that was not a factor at all with him. I think there was some lack of
                    experience in foreign matters; but he relied on his staff and on me pretty
                    strongly, and it worked out well. But it wasn't like my next ambassador, Walter
                    Stoessel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was a professional to the core.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes. But with Gronouski it worked out very well. And we experienced some
                    very interesting things, if you want to hear about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, absolutely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: This was a period, '66, that was beginning to become turbulent again.
                    First of all, it was the Polish millennium, and the church in Poland was
                    exerting itself. They took the Black Madonna icon from Czestochowa and paraded
                    this national symbol throughout Poland. It stirred up the population
                    fantastically. They brought the icon to Warsaw and there was complete
                    turbulence. The day I arrived in Warsaw authorities had confined the Black
                    Madonna to St. John's Cathedral. It could be put up in the cathedral, but no
                    parading it around the city. Well, there was a tremendous reaction against this,
                    and mobs surged up the main street, marching towards the Communist party
                    headquarters. Embassy First Secretary Herb Kaiser and I were following along to
                    see what was going on. Well, the crowd was disbursed before they got to party
                    headquarters, but that was the beginning of this turbulent period.</p>
                <p>Then there were several other things that occurred. The Vietnam War was on then,
                    and this put the Poles on a spot, because the Poles weren't anti-U.S.; because
                    we were giving them PL 480 assistance, cultural exchanges...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: PL 480 is grain and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes, grain sales with very long-term credit arrangements, with
                    provisions for use on Embassy expenses, exchanges, joint research, etc. And so
                    they didn't like to be put in this position of being politically boxed-in, with
                    America's fighting over in Vietnam and the possibility of Communist China's
                    joining in...</p>
                <p>So they tried to initiate a mediation in '66, which you might have heard of,
                    called “Operation Marigold.” Well, it had all started in Hanoi through the
                    initiative of a Pole, who was a member of the international commission (ICC),
                    named Lewandowski. He talked with Ambassador Lodge in Saigon and the Italian
                    ambassador in an effort to identify specific issues on which there could be
                    eventual agreement between Hanoi and the United States. Ten points were
                    identified and the effort to reach agreement was called Operation Marigold. The
                    initial step was to establish contact between Americans and the Vietnamese in
                    Warsaw.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>A cable came in from Washington asking our views on becoming involved. In fact,
                    the cable asked: “Mr. Ambassador, do you think your DCM is capable of taking on
                    this job?” Well, Gronouski wasn't there, so I was shown the cable, and I
                    thought, “Well, I hope he thinks so.” Gronouski came back to Warsaw the
                    following day and was shown the cable. He decided he also wanted very much to be
                    involved in something that could be a tremendous political victory, because he
                    felt it would facilitate a return to Washington to be involved with Johnson in
                    the political world. So he replied, “We'll both do it.”</p>
                <p>That winter of '66 up until Christmas Eve, we met frequently with Adam Rapacki,
                    the foreign minister, at night, without letting others know what was going on.
                    The frequent evening meetings and reports to the Department were an effort to
                    get an agreement on the ten points that Lewandowski had drafted, and thus put us
                    in direct contact with the Vietnamese. Sometimes I'd get a call right in the
                    middle of a social event, and I'd have to use an excuse—my son cut his hand, or
                    something—and leave; and off we would go to the Foreign Ministry.</p>
                <p>But we also had a military policy at that time, I think it was called Rolling
                    Thunder, the bombing campaign.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Against North Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: And one of the ten points of Marigold was a cessation of such bombing.
                    But apparently our administration didn't want to stop the military pressure.
                    Discussion with Rapacki narrowed down and narrowed down towards the end of
                    December to the point of at least leaving Hanoi and Haiphong out of the bombing.
                    But it was too late.</p>
                <p>And I can remember so well when Rapacki called us over on Christmas Eve which in
                    Poland is Wigilia. And he said, “You know, this (Christmas Eve) is the most
                    important day in Poland.” And this is going to be our last meeting. Why did you
                    bomb Hanoi?” In response to our assurance we would look into the situation, he
                    replied, “No, the Vietnamese will not have anything more to do with it.”</p>
                <p>Now this isn't to say that the end of Operation Marigold was our fault, but the
                    Poles were really trying to mediate out of their own self-interest, because they
                    wanted to maintain beneficial relations with us. But Lewandowski's and Rapacki's
                    efforts came to naught.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about dealing there in Warsaw with the Soviets?
                        How did we see the Soviets there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, we saw them, formally, very little. They had a compound that was a
                    fortress; hardly anybody could come in. The ambassador's name was Aristov, who
                    was a member of the CPSU Central Committee, and he was a rather personable
                    individual.</p>
                <p>I was charg�, between Ambassador Gronouski and Stoessel, for about seven or eight
                    months, because, as I say, Gronouski wanted to get back into the political
                    campaign in '67, '68, and Stoessel couldn't leave, because of the critical
                    East-West situation, he was Assistant Secretary for EUR, so I stayed on.</p>
                <p>But here's the first example of what happened. This was '67, just before the
                    six-day war in Israel, the Arab- Israeli War.</p>

                <p>JENKINS: There was a big party of the diplomatic corps. My wife and I were
                    dancing, and the Soviet Embassy Counselor and the DCM of the Egyptian Embassy
                    cut in and started dancing around with us in a circle. You ask yourself, what
                    the heck is this about? And they were chanting things like “it's going to be a
                    new world.” We didn't know it, but the attack on Israel had already begun. Of
                    course, it turned out very differently from what they thought it was going to
                    be. But this was my first of such contacts with the Soviets—”we're winning;
                    we're going to show you,” relapsed into frustration. All Israeli embassies in
                    Soviet Bloc countries were closed down.</p>
                <p>But one very interesting sidelight. There was a Polish Nationalist friend of
                    mine, whom I had known in the Polish embassy in Washington, who was in 1967
                    economic advisor to a high- level official in Warsaw. I won't name him, because
                    he's somewhere in the West now. But he said, “Come over to my boss's house,
                    we're having a little reception, and we're going to talk about the economic
                    situation here.” He was late for the event, but eventually arrived, breathless.
                    He said, “You know, Walt, the whole situation has changed.”</p>
                <p>I asked, “How is that?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Do you know, the day after the Israeli victory, seven of our embassies
                    abroad raised the Israeli flag along with the Polish flag. That gives us our
                    chance.”</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>So thus began the purge of Jewish elements throughout the government and party.
                    Most of the ministers had been eliminated earlier, but many of the vice
                    ministers, many of the key people were now kicked out. Most of them. Satanowski,
                    the symphony director whom I had known in Poznan, was Jewish, and he left to
                    became the director of the symphony orchestra in D�sseldorf, Germany. A lot of
                    them left, and they were replaced with Polish Nationalist types. This friend of
                    mine was very definitely a Polish Nationalist economist. And so the purge
                    intensified; and nearly all of the Jewish officials were eliminated.</p>
                <p>This was a very interesting development, because it began a new Nationalist
                    tendency. Interior Minister Moczar, who had been the Polish guerrilla leader
                    during World War II, led the Nationalist Poles and eventually in 1970 helped
                    eliminate Gomulka, in collusion with Edward Gierek. Gomulka had a Jewish wife,
                    and that's one thing they used against him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, that story about seven embassies raising the
                        Israeli flag sounds like a put-up thing, doesn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: It does.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It just doesn't sound very professional. It just looked
                        like this was a good excuse.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it doesn't sound like it really happened.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I'm not sure whether it actually occurred or not. You see, what happened
                    after World War II was that the Soviets did not really trust the Poles; so they
                    inserted many high-ranking Polish Jews into key positions. The original security
                    minister was a Polish Jew. The Soviets installed them, and the Nationalist Poles
                    were trying to get rid of them. The Israeli flag scenario could very well have
                    been a put-up job. But I do know that many residual Jewish officials were pretty
                    pro-Soviet and knew that they were being protected by the Soviets. And the
                    Soviet Union was not so anti-Israel in the early days. I mean, didn't this begin
                    it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it began about that time, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>JENKINS: I was charg� then, and I recall going down to the airport to see the
                    PNGed Israelis off. The whole diplomatic corps was there, because most were very
                    fond of the Israeli mission representatives. They were nice guys, and they were
                    the source of most of the useful information at that time, because most were of
                    Polish origin and spoke Polish perfectly. As they were leaving, with the Dutch
                    ambassador as guardian diplomat, going out to the plane, the first secretary,
                    was carrying the diplomatic pouch. And this UB security guard grabbed it away
                    from him and said, “You can't have that,” and pushed him toward the plane.</p>
                <p>Well, the Texan came out in me and I spontaneously exploded, “Let him alone, you
                    son of a bitch!”</p>
                <p>I was called in by the chief of protocol the next day. They were not citing me as
                    making the remark but rather blamed another Embassy officer, who belonged to
                    another agency. Well, I replied, “Did you see what happened out there?”</p>
                <p>“Doesn't make any difference, Mr. Jenkins, your political officer should not have
                    done that. It's not according to protocol.”</p>
                <p>Well, I said, “Just remember, this shouldn't have been done either.”</p>
                <p>But they were really rough with the Israelis at that time. It was too bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the security efforts against your mission while
                        you were DCM? Because this was really your responsibility.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, before my arrival the Embassy had uncovered the first microphone
                    behind a broken radiator in the DCM's office And then they uncovered overall
                    about ninety.</p>
                <p>Also, we had a bit of a problem initially with a security officer who had a
                    rather unusual “sting” technique for exposing suspected security problems, be
                    they sexual vulnerabilities, marine security problems, or other situations.
                    After several such incidents, he was replaced. There was no doubt, however, that
                    the UB made every effort to penetrate our security.</p>
                <p>At regular staff meetings I reminded our Embassy members about Polish
                    intelligence efforts to breach our security, including efforts to compromise or
                    entrap our personnel. I always reminded them to immediately report any such
                    incidents.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>Well, by gosh, one young officer did come in after one of these briefings and
                    reported, “You know, something strange happened to me. I was down at a
                    well-known restaurant in the old town. And when I came out, there were a couple
                    of young guys there who seemed a bit drunk, but they were very friendly and
                    jovial and invited me up to their house. And so I went with them. They served
                    some more drinks, sat me down, and then they disappeared. But then, all of a
                    sudden, bright lights came on and this rather attractive nude gal came out and
                    tried to cotton up to me. And I ran out, but this is what happened.”</p>
                <p>Well, I said, “Thank God you did come.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened? How did we operate? I mean, the young man
                        told about this, and then...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: It was reported. He finished his tour in Warsaw. Everything was all
                    right; we had talked about it, and he continued on to have a career in the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Walter Stoessel came. He was ambassador there from '68 to
                        '72, so you had him for the first half of his tour. How did he operate? Was
                        there a difference? I mean, how did he use you, and how did you see him
                        heading an embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: He was a wonderful guy. He was not a person who said, “I've got a lot of
                    views on this, and this should be done, and I think our policy should be so and
                    so.” He kept things on an even keel, and very, very professionally. He developed
                    very good relationships with other diplomats and Polish officials, because they
                    really recognized him as a competent professional.</p>
                <p>Initially, in speaking Polish he had a Russian accent that I used to tease him
                    about occasionally, but it ironed out.</p>
                <p>I think the first experience of how we worked together was a cable that came in
                    from Henry Kissinger in early '69 that said: “It's time to reopen our China
                    talks.” (They had been discontinued in the mid 60's due to problems in the Far
                    East, including Vietnam.). “I want you to make contact with the Chinese
                    ambassador to reopen these talks.” So we talked about it: How should we do it?
                    Ambassador Stoessel asked, “You speak a little Chinese, don't you?”</p>
                <p>I replied, “I've forgotten most of it, but I know a little. I know how to say hao
                    bu hao and so forth.” Then I added, “I have a good idea. You know, Mr.
                    Ambassador, the Yugoslavs are going to have a fashion show and party early next
                    week, and everybody's invited. I suggest we both go, and we'll sit at separate
                    tables. But when the Chinese ambassador leaves, at the cloak room, I'll go at
                    the same time and sort of bump into him, and 'Oh, excuse me,' and introduce
                    myself. And then I'll tell him, 'I want you to meet my ambassador.'”</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>“Do you think it'll work?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, we can try it.”</p>
                <p>And so we did: Fashion show, cloak room, and I introduced myself. And he was, you
                    know, being very Chinese and bowing hands clasped. I said, “I want you to meet
                    my ambassador.” So they were introduced. And then Walter Stoessel said (they
                    found a Chinese interpreter then, I wasn't good enough in Chinese) that he hoped
                    we could meet again sometime soon.</p>
                <p>“Hao, hao, hao,” (OK), said the Chinese Ambassador.</p>
                <p>So we invited them over to our embassy. We didn't put it in the old place, one of
                    the palaces in a park across the way, because we found out that it was pretty
                    well tapped by the Poles. And they showed up at the embassy the following week
                    in one of the biggest black limousines I've ever seen. Anything to be a little
                    bigger than the Russian Zils. They entered and I met them. We had the
                    interpreters and specialists down from Stockholm, who were the China-talks
                    specialists. I had it all arranged with the Marine guards, you know, send us up
                    to the fourth floor to meet with the ambassador in his office. The Marine guard
                    accidentally pushed the wrong elevator button and sent us down to the basement.
                    I think they thought I was kidnapping them at first. But that was rectified, and
                    we went up and had our first meeting. And that was the reopening of the talks
                    with China.</p>
                <p>Well, of course, Kissinger was already thinking and had talked a lot...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was then the head of the NSC, National Security
                        Council.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes, that's right. And he probably was already thinking about a Nixon
                    visit to China, and the preparation was underway, you know, in his own mind. He
                    had been talking with a lot of people, including Fairbanks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was John Fairbanks, at Harvard.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Who had mentioned in a number of talks with Kissinger (of course, they
                    were both at Harvard) that this would be a good opportunity to reopen things
                    with China.</p>
                <p>So that's how I remember the reopening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other major problems that you had to deal
                        with while you were in Warsaw?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, I remember another interesting thing while I was charg� (1967-68)
                    in between Ambassadors. There was the Prague Spring.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, '68.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: In the spring of '68. Oh, there was excitement in Poland. And all along
                    the border you could take boat rides down the Dunajec River bordering on
                    Czechoslovakia, and it was obvious that the Poles were just so envious. And,
                    among other things, there was the reaction this Prague Spring had on the other
                    East European countries.</p>
                <p>One specific instance I remember was the dinner party given by Romanian
                    Ambassador Petrescu for departing Mexican Ambassador Ju�rez, who was a
                    grandnephew of Benito Ju�rez. And he had invited the Russian Ambassador Aristov
                    and his wife, Laura and myself, and Argentine Ambassador and Mrs. Tavrel. So we
                    went. And towards the end of the dinner, the Romanian ambassador was perspiring,
                    but he had instructions, so he recited a toast to Mexican Ambassador Juarez,
                    saying, “You know, Mr. Ambassador, your country and my country share the same
                    experience. We're both adjacent to great powers, and we both share a fear and
                    the pressures of these great powers.” Well, Mrs. Aristov began to twitch and
                    excused herself from the table. Then Petrescu went on to say, “So I say farewell
                    to you. Welcome back to your home in Mexico. I hope everything will be
                    okay.”</p>
                <p>Well, the Mexican ambassador replied, “You're absolutely right, Mr. Ambassador,
                    we both live next to huge superpowers. But if you gave me a hundred dollars for
                    every American soldier on my border, and I gave you one dollar for every Soviet
                    soldier on your border, you'd make a lot more money than I would.”</p>
                <p>Ambassador Aristov left the table.</p>
                <p>Well, after dinner, Juarez invited us over to his residence along with the
                    Argentineans. We went down to the lower level social room and over to the bar.
                    Up behind the bar was a pistol in a holster. I said, “Who did that belong
                    to?”</p>
                <p>“That's Pancho Villa's.”</p>
                <p>And then he pulled out a machete and slapped it down on the bar several times,
                    offering us a drink. “Now I want to tell you what I really think about the
                    United States.”</p>
                <p>So I got Pancho Villa's pistol and put it down by the machete. I said, “Go
                    ahead.”</p>
                <p>He said, “You all shouldn't be fooling around in Eastern Europe. You should be
                    back home taking care of the problems there.”</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>But this was another Russian experience. They were undergoing an awful lot by
                    1968.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, what was your estimate when you were there— we're
                        talking about the '66 to '70 period—of the value to the Soviets of the
                        Polish forces in the Warsaw Pact?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I think they had no great illusions about the loyalty of Polish forces.
                    The Soviets only had two divisions stationed in Poland, but those were for the
                    security of the main transportation lines through Warsaw and Poznan and Wroclaw
                    over to East Germany, where they had twenty divisions. So the importance of
                    Poland, which had always been the “parade ground of Europe” throughout history,
                    was as communication link to their real basic position, anchor in Europe, which
                    was in East Germany. So I think this was their principal feeling about the
                    importance of Poland as part of the Warsaw Pact. I suppose Jaruzelski, who was
                    the commander then and had been trained in the USSR during the war, was the
                    securest guy they could think of, but they had no illusions about the
                    dependability of the Poles.</p>
                <p>That's one reason they're not getting out of Poland now as fast, because of their
                    troops still in East Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other events that we haven't covered during
                        this Warsaw period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I think that's basically it. The things I remember the most were, as I
                    say, the Arab-Israeli War, the Prague Spring, and the reopening of the China
                    talks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there, or were you by any chance on leave or
                        something, during the suppression of Czechoslovakia?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Oh, yes, that's another. I almost forgot that one. No, I was still
                    charg�.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Polish forces went in, didn't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, I was sitting there in the embassy, and Herb Kaiser, the first
                    secretary, and his family were going on a trip north to the Masurian Lakes. And
                    when they got to a little town about forty miles out of Warsaw, they were
                    stopped by the UB, the security police, and told to go home, back to Warsaw.
                    Well, during ten years, I knew we were stopped frequently by the security, but
                    we were never told to go back. And I said, “Herb, you stay right there. And I'm
                    going in to the Foreign Ministry right away and protest.”</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>So I went in. They received me. I remember it was Dobrosielski who had the
                    American desk then. And I said, “You know, Herb Kaiser, my first secretary, is
                    out in Plonsk, and he's been told to come back to Warsaw, by the police.</p>
                <p>And he said, “Oh, that can't be true.”</p>
                <p>So, with me there, he got on the phone and called the Ministry of Interior and
                    said, “You know, I have the American charg� here, and he says his first
                    secretary was told to come back to Warsaw. And I'm just about to tell him
                    that...oh, you mean, he is supposed to come back? Oh,” he hummed, “yeah, he's
                    supposed to come back.”</p>
                <p>Well, this was the first indication that the Soviet troops were coming in through
                    eastern Poland to go down to the Czech border. So I told Dobrosielski, whom I'd
                    known quite well, “Well, you're going down to the Tatra Mountains for a month's
                    vacation. I want you to please be very careful—you might be run over by a Soviet
                    tank.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Oh, no, Mr. Jenkins, no.”</p>
                <p>He came back in September. I met him at a reception, and I said, “What did I tell
                    you?” The invasion had already taken place.</p>
                <p>He said, “Mr. Jenkins, it was worse than that. It was a Polish tank.”</p>
                <p>And so the Polish forces did go in.</p>
                <p>But the Polish reaction was very interesting. We had a petroleum project in Plock
                    and a Central Committee member, who was head of their petroleum industry, was
                    there. And the armies crossed the Czech border. He called the American engineer
                    in and asked, “Hey, I have here the New York Herald Tribune and I have the
                    Trybuna Ludu.” (Their Party paper.) “Trybuna Ludu says 'invitation.' The Herald
                    Tribune says 'invasion.' Now which is it?”</p>
                <p>And the American engineer hemmed and hawed a little bit, “It looks pretty much
                    like an invasion to me.”</p>
                <p>“By gosh, I think you're right. Because, especially if you're invited in as a
                    guest, you don't move the furniture around.”</p>
                <p>But this was a typical Polish reaction, you know. And Dobrosielski was sorry
                    about it as was this Central Committee member that we were involved with; but
                    they did go in.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any reactions on our side? I mean, did you make
                        any protest or anything such as that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: About the invasion?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About the invasion.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I had very close liaison with several ambassadors, particularly the
                    British ambassador, and we exchanged information a lot. But I got the definite
                    feeling, I must confess, that we didn't want an invasion then, during Vietnam,
                    and we didn't really want to think there was going to be an invasion. Even some
                    of our attach�s were late in saying that this was really going to be an
                    invasion, because we got the definite impression from Washington, and the
                    British ambassador did, too, that this was a busy time and we didn't want to be
                    involved. I mean, Vietnam was still very big, and we don't want to get into a
                    mess here. So actually it wasn't until the last minute that we really thought
                    that they were going to invade. So we didn't go in protesting or anything like
                    that beforehand, of course. And even afterwards, let's not rough-up the waters.
                    I mean, we've got enough to do out in Vietnam, and just let it go.</p>

                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: I left Warsaw in the summer of 1970, right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And came back to the Office of Scientific Affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, in SCI, the Office of Scientific and Technological Affairs, I was
                    mostly involved in European agreements, joint programs, particularly Eastern
                    Europe, but also the NATO science committee.</p>
                <p>We went to Yugoslavia to renegotiate the PL 480 agreement, which was used to
                    finance joint scientific research. There was only six million dollars' worth of
                    local currency left in the pot. And Norman Neureiter, who was with the
                    President's Science Advisor's Office, and I negotiated an agreement whereby they
                    would match our six million, making a local currency equivalent of twelve
                    million dollars to be used for scientific and technological cooperation in
                    Yugoslavia. Such joint use meant that they wouldn't have to pay it back in
                    dollars.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>I did the same thing in Poland, and then went with our delegation to Moscow in
                    the spring of '72 (snowed almost every day for six weeks), negotiating the U.S.-
                    Soviet cultural exchange agreement, my part of which was science and
                    technology.</p>
                <p>And we were after one thing in particular. They had a pretty advanced electrical
                    energy project on what is called magneto hydrodynamics, MHD. They had put a lot
                    of money into it. And it was one of the things, along with fusion, that we were
                    looking into as a future source of energy. And we wanted to work out an
                    agreement which assured our full access to the results of their research. They
                    were adamant, and it is what held up the whole agreement for six weeks, my
                    little section of the accord</p>
                <p>Finally, they caved. And I felt so proud of myself. I mean, here we'd negotiated
                    MHD and got something to our advantage. And we flew back home.</p>
                <p>That same weekend, I got a call from my old friend Norman Neureiter, at the White
                    House Science Advisor's Office. He said, “Walt, I have just come back from
                    Korea. I got a telephone call and the White House wants me back now. We've got
                    to negotiate a new science agreement with the Soviet Union.”</p>
                <p>“But, Norm, I just finished doing that.”</p>
                <p>“Yeah, I know, but I was told to come back, and you've got to come over to make
                    plans, and we're going to talk with them.”</p>
                <p>So we met with the Soviet Embassy science counselor in the State Department. And
                    I was sticking to the same things, including MHD, I wanted to get in the Moscow
                    agreement. And the counselor said, “Can't do it.” And finally he said, “I am
                    going back to tell my ambassador that you are disobeying the agreement between
                    your Secretary and him.”</p>
                <p>Well, this was the first we ever knew that Kissinger had made an agreement with
                    the Soviet ambassador. It turned out that there was to be a series of agreements
                    on space, science, technology, environment, and other things— for different
                    people to sign during President Nixon's upcoming summit meeting. The Secretary
                    of State would sign one, the President would sign another, and so and so would
                    sign the next one. So we had to renegotiate separate agreements on these various
                    fields, to be taken and signed at the upcoming summit trip to Moscow. So we
                    learned, through the back door, that we were supposed to negotiate new
                    agreements. Which we did. These became our still-valid science and technology
                    agreement with the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must have pretty well taken up most of your
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>JENKINS: It took a lot of time. But then, the last year, I went to Geneva for the
                    CSCE, the Conference on Security and Cooperation in Europe, where I was the
                    deputy and alternate head of the U.S. delegation, responsible substantively for
                    science and technology and environment. So I had ten months in Geneva,
                    negotiating those...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about that negotiation? At that time did
                        it seem like sort of a secondary thing while Kissinger was working on other
                        arms control things?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, we did have pretty close relations with the boys over in the arms
                    control negotiation, including Paul Nitze. And, yes, I had a feeling
                    definitely...not that I personally felt it was secondary, because I was working
                    closely with the cultural group, and I was trying to weave into our science and
                    technology all of the things about open contacts and sharing of information that
                    they had in the cultural. But I got a feeling that, back home again with
                    Secretary Kissinger, this was not a primary interest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, well, I've gotten this in some other interviews, too,
                        that later this turned out to be a far more important thing than at the
                        beginning he had planned it to be, or really anybody else had. I mean, it
                        became a primary thing. But at that time it was given a rather soft pedal, I
                        guess.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Oh, very much so. And I remember we'd have periodic meetings with the
                    Russians, separately. And the way we learned what the flavor was in all of these
                    things was not from our instructions from the Department, but from the
                    Russians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: George Vest, who was later in Helsinki, was saying that he
                        was finding out actually through the East Germans, who were getting it from
                        the Soviets who were coming around, and, you know, it was a very difficult
                        period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Oh, sure. And he was my first boss. But it was very much that way. The
                    French didn't think it was terribly important. I think some of the others did,
                    and certainly the Swedes and the Swiss and other “neutrals” thought it was
                    terribly important. Because they were coming in along with the East Germans.</p>
                <p>I finished the science and technology and environment portions which were
                    initialed, and left to become consul general in Stuttgart. But later I found out
                    that my initialed agreements in those fields had been changed in a compromise
                    with the Soviets to get agreement on the entire CSCE package.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the Office of Scientific Affairs from 1970
                        to...?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>JENKINS: From 1970 to '74.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you were consul general in Stuttgart from when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: From '74 to '78 I was consul general in Stuttgart, in what I consider is
                    one of the nicest consular districts there is. It included Heidelberg, Lake
                    Constance, Baden-Baden and the Black Forest. Furthermore, it's where all of our
                    major military commands were located. The European Command, EUCOM, was just
                    outside Stuttgart; the Seventh Corps was in Boblingen, near Stuttgart; the
                    Seventh Army was headquartered in Heidelberg. And so we had a very close
                    relationship with the military.</p>
                <p>The way I would like to start out with Stuttgart is to hark back to my Resident
                    Officer days in Schw�ebisch Hall, which isn't too far from Stuttgart. When
                    people asked me then did I think that democracy was really going to work in
                    Germany, I tended to be rather positive by the end of my Schwabisch Hall tour. I
                    felt that: (1) if national security was assured, (2) viable democratic
                    institutions were developed, and (3) a reasonable prosperity developed, Germany
                    might make it, in a generation or two, and really become democratic, maybe not
                    exactly the way we are.</p>
                <p>And my tour in Stuttgart, although maybe it's too localized, sort of convinced me
                    that I was right. We did have this American security presence working together
                    with the German effort. We had one of the most prosperous regions you can
                    imagine, with Daimler-Benz, Porsche, Robert Bosch, IBM, and all the machine tool
                    and electronic companies located in that region. It was a pretty booming place.
                    And also the political institutions seemed to be working. You know, you had
                    three parties, but basically the Socialists (SPD), the CDU and the FDP. You
                    didn't have a lot of little splinter parties as in Italy and France at that
                    time; it was working well. The federal relationship was working very well
                    between Bonn, Baden- W�rttemberg and the others states. So I sort of felt that,
                    gee whiz, maybe I was right. But this has only been two generations between
                    Schwabisch Hall and the present; let's see what happens from now on.</p>
                <p>Americans developed close relations with the Germans. We had a lot of friends,
                    particularly in “the upper crust.” They seemed to cultivate the commanders of
                    our forces and our consul general.</p>
                <p>However, all wasn't a bed of roses. At that time, one of the outstanding
                    attention getters in Germany was the Bader-Meinhof Gang, which later became the
                    Red Army Faction. Now these young terrorists, strangely enough, mostly came from
                    around the Baden-W�rttemberg area. Sons and daughters of Calvinistic elements
                    who were very puritanical and who “knew what was right.” They were nearly all
                    well educated. And they had turned to terrorism as a way of expressing their
                    frustration and point of view.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>So, they came and were operating mostly in our consular district. Most of them,
                    when they were caught, were put in jail in the Stuttgart area too, in Stamheim.
                    So we had quite an intimate contact with the Bader-Meinhof environment.</p>
                <p>Of course, they did wound U.S. General Fritz Klosson, the commander of the
                    Seventh Army in Heidelberg, in his car on his way to work. And our own security
                    was very, very tight. But actually I began to see developing an approach to even
                    difficult situations like this that reinforced my feeling that, given a
                    continuation of good conditions, democracy was developing well in Germany.</p>
                <p>At first, the courts had a frustrating time with the Bader-Meinhof. They didn't
                    know which way to go. They didn't want to be too tough, like the Nazis had been,
                    and they didn't want to be too wishy-washy. And yet quite often they were
                    wishy-washy, you know, insufficient evidence, etc. But, finally, in this
                    two-year period when they were the most active, the courts developed a very
                    well-balanced, fair, not oppressive way of dealing with this type of crime. They
                    were very uncertain and unsure of themselves at the outset, but much more
                    confident and just at the end.</p>
                <p>A second thing that impressed me was that the press and the media had a very
                    different way of dealing with the Bader-Meinhof than, say, our press would.
                    Without censorship, but doing it on their own, when Schlier, the national head
                    of the German equivalent of our Chamber of Commerce, was kidnapped and killed,
                    it was put on page three. The Gang rarely gained the advantage of being front
                    page, which is what they really wanted to be. And this was the initiative of the
                    people in the press and television themselves.</p>
                <p>Another thing that I saw developing in Germany that interested me, taking another
                    one of the three economic prosperity elements, was that, whereas you had free
                    enterprise, you had a much closer relationship between government and industry,
                    and between industry and labor than we're used to having here in the U.S.</p>
                <p>I'll never forget, I was sitting down with fellow Rotarian, Prof. Dr. Joachim
                    Zahn, then the director of Daimler-Benz, when he got a phone call from a
                    colleague up in the Ruhr. And he came back to the conference room absolutely
                    furious. He said, “You know what they've agreed to up there in Bonn, and this
                    industrial leader friend of mine agreed to it, is Mitbestimmung!” That means
                    “co-determination”—trade unions would be taken onto the executive boards of the
                    industries and they would work together. Well, Zahn was against this at
                    Daimler-Benz, but it became the norm and they all got used to it.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>Another was when there was going to be a big negotiation, say, between the steel
                    workers and the industry. I'd have lunch with the head of the steel workers'
                    union. He'd say, “Well, I know these are difficult times, we're just coming out
                    of the '74-75 recession, but we're going to ask for an eight percent raise.
                    They're going to tell us they can't do more than two percent. But we're going to
                    compromise on five percent.” The next week, I had lunch with the local head of
                    the industry for steel. He said, “We have it pretty tough, you know, that guy's
                    a hard-nosed so and so, but we're going to say, 'In the wake of this recession
                    nothing can be done—two percent.' And they're going to ask for eight. And we're
                    going to compromise on five.” And so, you know, it was all sort of a sense of
                    what was going to happen. They knew each other well.</p>
                <p>Again with Zahn and Daimler-Benz, during the recession he said, “What on earth is
                    going on in America? Your General Motors has laid off 20,000 workers. That's
                    terrible. We never lay off workers. We put them on Kurzarbeit.” (That means half
                    pay.) “And the government picks up the other half, and that tides us through a
                    recession. I can't understand why you'd....”</p>
                <p>So what I'm saying is, it isn't the old corporate state, but there's a much
                    closer relationship and cooperative relationship between government, industry,
                    and trade unions than we're familiar with in the States.</p>
                <p>Those were my principal impressions of Stuttgart— outside of a wonderful four
                    years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, looking back on it, if a young man or a young woman
                        came to you and said they were thinking of going into the Foreign Service—I
                        mean, obviously it's changed a lot today from when you came in, but how
                        would you reply?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: My strong inclination is to reply that a future in the Foreign Service
                    could be great. In other words, I base that premise on the fact that the
                    predominant military and intelligence emphasis is going down in significance;
                    and now is the chance for us to be out in the world economically, culturally and
                    informationally; so the career could be great. That's my first inclination.</p>
                <p>But then I watch things, and I watch the Gulf, and I watch...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about the war against Iraq in the Persian
                        Gulf.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>JENKINS: Yes. And I'm not so sure that what I just said is bound to be true. I'd
                    also see, every time I went into a State Department office recently (I was with
                    CDC the declassification area for quite a while in the department after
                    retirement), I'd go in to consult with young officers, frequently the desk
                    officer, glued to word processor and computer, and to be told by the secretary
                    that he was busy right then, completely absorbed by this stuff on the screen. Of
                    course, I remember, way back then, first the legal-sized dispatches, then the
                    airgrams, and then the cables. But I wonder; I'm not sure. In this world of fast
                    communications, when Secretary of State Jim Baker gets so and so on the phone
                    and talks directly, or the president does, it might be a different Foreign
                    Service—glued to the word processor?</p>
                <p>I think there would be many great things for a young person to do in the
                    economic, cultural, informational, and reporting fields. Because I am strongly
                    convinced that the guys in the consulates in Iran knew more about what was going
                    on at the time of the Shah and Khomeini than they did in the military mission in
                    the embassy.</p>
                <p>I know very well that when I was in Poznan, we knew more about what was going on,
                    and the mood of the people during the Cuban missile crisis than they did in
                    Warsaw.</p>
                <p>So I think there are great opportunities—if the system and the bureaucracy
                    doesn't throw them out the window or through the computer screen. That's my
                    view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I want to thank you very much. This has been
                        delightful.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>JENKINS: Well, I've enjoyed it. I always enjoy rambling on about my view of
                    things.</p>
