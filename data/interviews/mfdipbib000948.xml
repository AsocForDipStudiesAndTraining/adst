                <p>DOROTHY PRINCE</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Joan Bartlett</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 10, 1991</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is an interview with Dorothy Prince at her house in
                        Tamworth, New Hampshire on April 10, 1991. We've just finished a wonderful
                        lunch and are beginning to talk about a lot of things and we want to put it
                        down on tape before we lose it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Can you start off by telling us a little bit about your childhood and your
                    growing up?</p>
                <p>PRINCE: I grew up in Manchester, New Hampshire. My father was a mill worker, and
                    my mother a secretary in a small business. We were very poor. I was always keen
                    to get out and see the great world, and I got to college through scholarships
                    and work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to college in Maine, didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: I went to Bates College in Maine. I went into the principal's office in
                    my high school one day, and said, “Mr. Morrison, I'd like to go to college. Do
                    you know anyplace that would give me a scholarship?” He was a Bates man, and I
                    was the valedictorian. (I always did everything that was possible to do because
                    I somehow had this urge to get all of the world in that I possibly could.) So he
                    was instrumental in my getting scholarships to Bates, where I also did very
                    well, and joined everything in sight, except the debating team. I was invited to
                    join the team but my guardian angel said, “Dorothy, you already hold forth at
                    great length. If this quality in you is nurtured by debating, it will be
                    impossible to live with you.” So I said, “No, thank you.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were your family very supportive that you go off, or did
                        they want you to stay at home?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: My mother and I were best friends all our lives, and she was happy that I
                    could go. And my father, poor man, was pleased that somebody in his family could
                    go to college; it was something he could feel good about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And after college you went to Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>PRINCE: Yes. After college I had several job opportunities. This was in 1938, and
                    there weren't all that many jobs around. The ones I had lined up were in
                    executive-training and in publishing houses, which didn't pay much to start.
                    Unbeknownst to me, my mother had written to the Congressman [Arthur Byron Jenks]
                    from our First District, for whom she'd worked when he was a businessman in
                    Manchester, to ask his help in finding me a job. Out of the blue came an offer
                    to work as a secretary in Mr. Jenks's office, at a salary higher than any of the
                    others. I had college loans to repay and wanted to help at home, so I went to
                    Washington and there I worked until I married: for a couple of Congressmen; for
                    The Foreign Commerce Weekly; for the Selective Service System during the early
                    days of its formation and operation. Then I decided I wanted to go into the
                    Foreign Service and was preparing to go as a Foreign Service Clerk when I was
                    asked if I would take time out. They were then setting up the arrangements for
                    the oral examination of candidates who'd passed the written exam for FSO's —
                    which had been given for the first time since the U.S. entered World War II. I
                    was asked to serve in that small unit, and it was really interesting — there
                    were just about six of us, working under a bright and very likeable young
                    officer, so we were able to contribute our ideas as things were set up, not just
                    do routine work. Part way along that course I said to myself, “I'd like to take
                    this exam myself.” So I enrolled in a history course at American University to
                    fill in a gap in my background, and I planned to stay in Washington for another
                    year and take the written exam when next it was given. I never let Edward forget
                    that I'd paid a $15.00 deposit on that history course, which I couldn't get
                    back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he actually being interviewed when you met him? You
                        saw him there answering questions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: I didn't sit in on the exam. I did the before-and-after bit. It was in
                    Chicago. There were so many candidates to be examined that after a time they
                    split into two boards: one to go to Chicago and St. Louis and the other to the
                    Southwest, to take people from those areas, as well as a board continuing in
                    Washington. It was very funny. I was a motherly type, and it was clear that a
                    lot of these fellows were nervous; so I would try to make them feel at ease when
                    they came in, offering the morning paper or light conversation. Edward came in
                    very jauntily. I thought, well, this guy doesn't need any of my attentions; I
                    didn't pay any further special heed to him at all. A couple of the other fellows
                    did show some response and before I left had taken me out. But when Edward came
                    to Washington and we met on the street, there was a little spark in his eye and
                    he noticed me then! Forty days later we were married.</p>
                <p>And a rare thing happened. Remember Mrs. Shipley, the long-time head of the
                    Passport Section? Well, Edward already had his assignment to Budapest and his
                    passport, at the time we decided to marry. Eric Wendelin, my supervisor at the
                    time, sweet-talked Mrs. Shipley into issuing a passport in my married name
                    before I was married; it was to be held at the New York office until we turned
                    up with the marriage certificate to claim it. This enabled me to go with Edward
                    to his post.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think we should censor that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: I think she's probably — God rest her soul — beyond any disciplinary
                    action for this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were you married?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: We were married in Manchester, New Hampshire, in October 1946. I came up
                    here to Tamworth to meet Edward's parents, his father was a retired Episcopal
                    priest from Illinois. They were wonderful people, a real bonus in my marriage to
                    Edward.</p>
                <p>After a honeymoon in New York, we boarded the SS Washington for Le Havre. A
                    passenger ship originally, she had been re-fitted for troop transport during the
                    war and, in November 1946, had not yet been reconverted for passenger service.
                    When we were in New York Edward had lunched with an old Navy friend (he had been
                    a Navy flyer in the war); he was bemoaning the fact that as newlyweds he would
                    be bunking in with five other men and I with five other women. Edward's friend
                    said, “Why don't you call U.S. Lines? They do have four cabins, and they might
                    have a cancellation. What do you have to lose?” So Edward, a brand-new,
                    wet-behind-the-ears Foreign Service officer, called U.S. Lines and said, “My
                    wife and I will be traveling to Le Havre on the SS Washington. We are going to
                    assignment in Hungary, and I wanted to ask that, if you should have a
                    cancellation in any of the cabin space, you consider us.” The savvy person at
                    the other end of the line said, “What grade Foreign Service officer?” Edward
                    drew himself up to his full five- feet-nine and said with dignity, “I am a
                    Foreign Service officer.” Well, it was the pre-spook period, but people were
                    going on sort of informal intelligence missions in the Russian-occupied areas;
                    and perhaps the guy got the impression that Edward was one of these special
                    intelligence people. Well, we sailed, and after supper stayed up on deck until
                    we'd passed the Statue of Liberty, and then retired to our respective six-person
                    cabins. Then there was a knock on the door; the purser was there and said, “Mrs.
                    Prince, will you come with me?” He escorted me to the upper deck, opened the
                    door of a cabin — and there was Edward! Somehow Edward had conveyed the idea we
                    were quite important. I sat at the Captain's right all the way across the
                    Atlantic, and he invited us to drinks in his cabin. There were all sorts of
                    important people aboard who didn't receive these favors! After landing at Le
                    Havre we went to Paris, where we had a couple of days to wait before proceeding
                    to Budapest.</p>
                <p>I still recall with emotion an experience in Paris. We'd become friendly at the
                    Captain's table with a young French woman, a social worker, and with an American
                    officer going to London as Naval Attach�. The parents of our French friend
                    invited us and the Naval Attach� to dinner at their apartment — at a time when
                    food was scarce and rationed!</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>(And we subsequently learned that the French are slow to invite guests into their
                    homes.) Yvonne's father said to us, “Twice in my lifetime the United States has
                    saved our country, and we are grateful.” Then we went by train to Vienna. And
                    aside from getting lost in the Vienna railway station, and looking for Edward
                    through carloads of Russian soldiers (I finally found him), we got to
                    Budapest.</p>
                <p>The first person I was introduced to at the legation was the Public Affairs and
                    Cultural Officer. I said, “You're Lew Revey. We were at Bates College
                    together.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, wonderful, an old friend.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Out of that connection came one of my more delightful adventures in the
                    Service. At that time, so soon after the war, things were still so under
                    organized that professorial exchange had not yet been reestablished. The
                    university approached Lew about a course on American literature they wanted to
                    offer; it wasn't possible to get a professor from the United States. So Lew said
                    to me, “Could you give some lectures on American literature?” (I'd been an
                    English major in college.) I said, “If you can get me some books from the
                    library, sure.”Q: In English, I hope.</p>
                <p>PRINCE: I was received by the faculty before my first lecture. There I was, a
                    youngish woman, not very big, and I wore definitely non-professorial clothes. We
                    took sherry together, and then they escorted me with dignity into the lecture
                    hall — which was sort of like an amphitheater, with raised tiers of seats. The
                    lovely courtesy of the European students! They all rise whenever the professor
                    comes in. So here was this young woman, with the perky hat with a red tassel on
                    it, walking down, all the students standing at attention! I lectured at the
                    regular university and also at the technical university.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And these students all spoke English?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Yes, they were college students and they had enough English so they could
                    understand it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Budapest like at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Budapest had suffered a great deal of damage because there was a sort of
                    siege, when the Russians were pushing back the Germans, who were holding out on
                    the west side of the river (the Danube). Of all the seven bridges, only one was
                    still intact at that time. The Coronation Church had suffered a good deal of
                    damage. That was where the Austro-Hungarian emperor would come to be crowned in
                    Hungary, as he had been in Vienna.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>The people had a tremendous vitality. You could see it in the women particularly.
                    They might have a very cheap dress that they'd made up themselves, but they wore
                    it with a 'swish', and they carried themselves with an air. You had this feeling
                    in the air, this is a very vital place. Cultural life was reviving at a good
                    pace, especially the opera — they translated the librettos into Hungarian. Quite
                    a sensation, to hear an Italian opera sung in Hungarian.</p>
                <p>The house we got to live in had been a hunting lodge — no crystal chandeliers.
                    But we loved it. It was in an area called the Huvosvolgy, which means “the cool
                    valley”, in the outskirts of the city. At the time it was built it probably was
                    countryside, but the city had grown out to include it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that in fairly good shape? Did the legation own
                        places?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: I guess the legation may have owned the Minister's residence. But no, we
                    had to find our own houses, and mainly through word of mouth — it's remarkable
                    how in a country under occupation, or under an authoritarian government, news of
                    all kind manages to get about in that way. The man who had this house was going
                    to go to the United States. He'd been invited to take a guest professorship at
                    Harvard. He was a professor of psychology. He wanted to let his house to
                    Americans so he could be paid in American currency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds charming.</hi>

                <p>PRINCE: It was just great. It was heated with wood in those wonderful tile stoves
                    like they have in Russia. And it was the only place where we ever had a cook,
                    and a maid. I gave two dinner parties a week. I was free as a bird. I was
                    fortunate to be able to take piano lessons with a man who taught the master
                    class at the conservatory, a pupil of Dohnanyi, who was a pupil of Liszt. In all
                    of the upheavals of the immediate postwar years, many things were possible that
                    would not have been possible in normal times. It was like living in an Eric
                    Ambler novel. Russian soldiers were round about, many of them young fellows.
                    When they got drunk they were quite unpredictable. When they were not drunk they
                    were very decent young chaps. I remember we were driving home one night, and
                    there were often roadblocks because people were trying to escape, and we were
                    stopped by a couple of Russian soldiers. We had just got our new Chevrolet. One
                    of the soldiers came over and made to open the front door, and I snatched it out
                    of his hand, and said, “Get out of here!” and put the lock down. Edward stepped
                    on the gas and said, “Put your head down.” I said, “Why?” He said, “He's got a
                    gun.” I hadn't noticed. Occasionally you would have this kind of experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>I think the most politically exciting thing that we were involved in personally
                    was at the time that Rakosi, the head of the Communist Party, staged his coup.
                    He was Vice Premier and he did it very cleverly. Premier Nagy, the
                    democratically elected head of government, leader of the Smallholders Party (a
                    moderate, peasant party), was away on holiday in Austria; and Rakosi sent word
                    that if he didn't come back, they would bring his family to the border. If he
                    did come back, they would not guarantee what would happen to them. So, he
                    accepted the deal, and Rakosi stepped into the role of Premier. Rakosi gave a
                    farewell luncheon for our Minister, Mr. Schoenfeld, at a local club. While we
                    were at that luncheon we knew that the leader of one of the major opposition
                    parties was being conducted down through our back garden to a back road where he
                    was going to be picked up and smuggled out of the country. And as we sat there
                    listening to compliments being paid, and much bowing being done on both sides
                    between Rakosi and the Minister, we knew what was happening at home. It went off
                    well. He did get away.</p>
                <p>All his life, to revert to my music teacher, he was a concert pianist, and he got
                    out to go on tour in Europe for an unlimited period. There was a plan for his
                    family to get out to join him, and by an unforeseen complication at the last
                    moment this failed, and it was too late for him to return. It was years later
                    before his family did in fact get out and joined him in the U.S. All through the
                    years, up until his death, we kept in touch. He ended up at the University of
                    California where he taught, and he also gave concerts, and conducted. I had a
                    reunion with his wife in 1981 — after 33 years! It was three years after Erno's
                    untimely death, and a year after Edward's (also untimely!). I have a Christmas
                    letter from her every year, and an open invitation to her home in Santa Barbara.
                    She had worked with Kodaly in Budapest, and teaches the Kodaly method at various
                    universities, in addition to having a number of private pupils. A wonderful,
                    brave and warm-hearted woman! I think friendships made in such difficult times
                    as those of post-war Budapest have a special staying power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went after Budapest to Montreal. That must have been
                        sort of a let down.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: It was. Minister Schoenfeld was uneasy because it was the time of the
                    Berlin airlift, and the tension was very high. He was concerned that there might
                    actually be some mishap that would result in conflict between us and the
                    Russians — if they, for instance, shot down one of our planes. So he asked the
                    Department to do something about the wives with young children especially, and
                    perhaps to expedite the transfer of any officers whose normal tour of duty was
                    about completed. We had been there just two years, and in December of '48 we
                    were transferred to Montreal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have children by then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>PRINCE: We had an eight-month-old baby girl, and a year-old dog that we called
                    Boldog, which is Hungarian for “happy”. So we set off by car to Le Havre, to
                    board ship for Christmas in New Hampshire before proceeding to Montreal.</p>
                <p>We had an adventure en route. We stopped in Germany at a restaurant in the
                    American zone. It was run by the Army. So, of course, we took the baby in, and
                    Edward took his briefcase, which had our passports, steamship tickets, and all
                    our other valuable papers. When we came out of the restaurant, Edward put his
                    briefcase on top of the car while he put the baby in her basket, and you know
                    what happened. We got a couple of miles down the road, and he said, “Where's my
                    briefcase?” So I got out and walked back along the ditch to look for it, and
                    Edward drove back. We got back to the restaurant, no sign of it. So we called
                    the suitable authorities, and roadblocks were set up to check the papers of
                    travelers, because a lot of people, of course, were wanting to get out to the
                    west. Edward then said sadly to one of the waitresses, “If a message should come
                    through for Edward Prince, we will be at such and such hotel in Munich.” She
                    said, “Prince? There was a message for a Mr. Prince.” And she had the telephone
                    number. So Edward called the number, and it turned out that the people who had
                    come out after us had seen the briefcase fall off, had picked it up and tried in
                    vain to catch up with us. The man was the CARE representative in the area, and
                    he said, “I'm at Rosenhelm, which is just off your route a few miles. I'll meet
                    you at the fountain in the center of the town.” So we went to Rosenhelm and met
                    the CARE man. Edward had a bottle of Hungarian wine in the car, so we uncorked
                    it, and sat around the rim of the fountain toasting each other, and thanking God
                    for the restoration of our valuable papers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have had some moments of big panic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: I don't know. The Lord sort of took over, I guess. Like many other
                    people, I think, my immediate reaction in a crisis is one of icy calm that lasts
                    for a certain period before I go to pieces.</p>
                <p>Montreal was a difficult post because household help was not any more available
                    than in the States. We arrived with a baby of eight months, and two more of our
                    children were born there. We had five children in seven years, so you can see
                    how they came along. We were there from '48 to '51.</p>
                <p>Montreal was one of the two busiest consular posts in the world at that time
                    (Mexico City was the other), because so many war-displaced people were seeking
                    entry into the U.S. It was a place that, at a different stage in our career, we
                    could have enjoyed more. But with the natural reserve of the French and Anglo
                    communities, the stress of work, and the family situation, we didn't find it
                    very easy.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you managed the household, you did everything.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: I remember one of Edward's efficiency reports said, “The Princes don't do
                    effective representation entertainment, but in view of the family situation this
                    is understandable.” It was in Montreal, early on, that I learned never to drink
                    a martini. (I had never had a cocktail until I was out of college.) At the end
                    of a long day taking care of three babies, to get dressed up, leave the babies
                    with a sitter, take the train into town, and go to an official cocktail party.
                    Well, a martini was served. I took one, and pretty soon, with great dignity, I
                    walked upstairs and lay down on the hostess's bed, where Edward came and
                    collected me when it was time to go home. I said, “This mixture is lethal.” And
                    I have never drunk a martini since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the cold, all those mittens and snowsuits. I mean, you
                        couldn't even get out, could you, without it being a major production, with
                        three children.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Yes, that's true. However, we made friendships with two couples that have
                    lasted all through the years. One, an American couple in business, full-time
                    residents there. The other a Canadian-American couple, also in business, whom we
                    met because the wife was the daughter of a clerical friend of Edward's father.
                    (I had a letter just recently from one of them.) We weren't able to take much
                    advantage of the cultural and intellectual life there, of course. We went then
                    to New Zealand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Straight from Montreal to New Zealand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Yes, and speaking of snowsuits, that was quite a production, because we
                    were going from one climate to another. We left in August; and I carried in my
                    hand luggage the winter things we would need for arriving in the middle of the
                    New Zealand winter; to be sure it's not anything like a New England winter, but
                    it is cold. We had a Pullman accommodation (pre-jet!) on the plane from San
                    Francisco, where for an hour, we lost one of our children in the airport! What
                    happened was that he'd rolled off the cot in the nursery and, still asleep,
                    rolled over again under the cot. So when we went to get our Jonathan, he wasn't
                    there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you panicked?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>PRINCE: Of course. It was midnight, and I was going around to all the offices
                    asking, “Have you seen a little two-year-old blonde boy?” Eventually we went
                    back to the nursery and found him sleeping peacefully under the bed! In the
                    Pullman accommodation, Edward and the two little boys, Jonathan and Tony, had
                    one, and Noelle, our three-year-old daughter, and I shared the other. She was so
                    hyped up that she didn't sleep the whole 36 hours, and, of course, neither did
                    I. When we changed planes at Fiji, to go on to Auckland, I got out the snow
                    suits and put them on the kids. At last we arrived at Wellington. We were the
                    last ones off the plane, by the time we'd gathered up the diaper bags, and the
                    food, and the kids, put the harness on number two, and the little one on
                    Edward's shoulder. A nice couple came forward as we left the plane and said,
                    “Are you the Princes?” And we said, “Who else?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You think your reputation preceded you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: I don't know. Anyway, this nice couple, the Whartons, were so kind. They
                    knew how wearied we would all be. So they had found a baby sitter. Our little
                    ones were so tired that after we had fed them at the hotel we put them
                    immediately to bed and they were out like a light. Happily, they seemed to have
                    no sense of strangeness in this unfamiliar place. Then the Whartons took us out
                    to their house for a relaxing evening. We thanked God again for the quality of
                    the people in the Foreign Service. Next morning we made our first acquaintance
                    with the British custom of morning-tea. A brisk knock on the door awakened us;
                    we groggily inquired, “What?” and a cheerful voice said, “Morning tea!” We said
                    something rude like, “Go away,” and went back to sleep.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it like in Wellington? Some people might say it
                        was dull, a little bit. It's also very beautiful, I hear.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: I never found it dull. In Montreal I hadn't been able to undertake any of
                    the usual things Foreign Service wives take on, but in New Zealand, for some
                    reason, I was invited to be on the National Board of the YWCA. It wasn't a very
                    irksome duty, but it brought me in contact with the people. We made friends with
                    some extremely interesting people. I had a contact through a friend who, during
                    the war, had been there cataloguing the National Library, and she gave me the
                    name of a particular friend of hers through whom then we formed a circle of
                    close friends: three of whom, interestingly enough, were psychiatrists, and
                    psycholoanalyst, whom we didn't need to consult professionally(!) but whose
                    wisdom, friendship and support, was something wonderful.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>About six months after our arrival I became pregnant again. Again, we discovered
                    that household help was not easy to come by. Our house had a small furnished
                    flat attached to the garage, at the far end of the garden: a bedroom,
                    kitchenette, and sitting-room. We advertized, offering the flat free to a
                    couple, of whom the wife would be expected to take part-time employment with us,
                    helping with the children and the work of the house. After some hair-raising
                    experiences with immigrating couples, we ended up with a wonderful Dutch couple.
                    At that time New Zealand was encouraging immigration, especially from Holland,
                    because the Dutch spoke flawless English and had the quality of industriousness
                    New Zealand wanted for their work force. A young man came to our door one day;
                    he said his fiancee was flying over in the London-to-New Zealand air race, that
                    they were to be married and, rental quarters being very hard to find, he was
                    responding to our advertizement. I said, “Why don't you wait until your fiancee
                    arrives and find out whether this would suit her?” So in due course he turned up
                    with this gorgeous girl. (She looked like a brunette Ingrid Bergman.) I invited
                    them in, we had coffee, and I told them I needed a half day's help with the
                    children and the housework five days a week, and baby-sitting in the evenings
                    when required.</p>
                <p>This young woman came of a well-off business family and had been accustomed to a
                    very comfortable life. I said, “I know I'd be happy to have you in my house, but
                    are you quite sure that you'd be willing to wash my floors?” And she said, “I
                    will have to wash my own, I do not mind to wash yours.” They were married from
                    our house, and their only attendants were our little Noelle (not quite 5) and
                    Jonny (3-1/2). We have not seen each other since we left New Zealand in 1955.
                    Subsequently, because of ill health of their parents, they returned to Holland,
                    and Wim went into business there. We have kept in touch, and I have a standing
                    invitation to visit them — and stay 'as long as I can.'</p>

                <p>PRINCE: One of our most cherished friendships was with Manu and Kaa Bennett. Manu
                    was an Anglican priest, whose father, Bishop Bennett, had translated the Bible
                    into the Maori language. They came and stayed with our children when Edward took
                    me to hospital for the birth of our little Mary, our fourth child, who died at
                    birth. And Manu took Edward to special Maori events at Rotorua and introduced
                    him to people influential in the Maori community. Manu himself subsequently
                    became Maori Bishop of New Zealand, and he and Kaa visited us here in Tamworth
                    in 1978 en route to the Lambeth Conference in England. And Manu preached at
                    Edward's little Episcopal church here in Tamworth! I visited them in 1987 in New
                    Zealand. When we left New Zealand Kaa had given me a grass skirt that was part
                    of her dowry (it's hanging upstairs in this house); and when I visited their
                    home I saw in a special niche the silver Crucifixion group we had sent them,
                    which we'd inherited from Edward's father. (It was hand-carried to them by the
                    New Zealand Ambassador to Washington, an old friend from our Wellington days —
                    who was concerned about insuring it until I reminded him that we knew he
                    wouldn't steal it, and that if his plane went down over the Pacific we'd be
                    grieving over him, not the little statues.)</p>
                <p>During our time in New Zealand, Hillary climbed Mount Everest — great was the
                    rejoicing there, in which we joined. And Princess Elizabeth and Prince Philip
                    visited the country, in the interval between her father's death and her
                    coronation. Our children waved British flags along with their chums. Edward and
                    I went to the royal garden party; and I was able to wave to her as I came out of
                    the butcher shop in our suburb. So casual was the security that she was driving
                    in an open car without a battalion of guards as she passed along our narrow main
                    street en route to more northerly parts! Dull, yet?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you loved all your postings. You always made the
                        best of things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: I think for women, as we mentioned earlier, relationships are the
                    important things, and we made friendships with kindred spirits. And among the
                    kindred spirits in New Zealand... I went to a morning coffee early days there,
                    and was introduced to women from the diplomatic group, and from the British High
                    Commissioner's office. Subsequently we went to a dinner party, and I saw a
                    familiar face among the ladies present, I went over to speak to this lady. I
                    didn't quite know what to say to her; I might not have been as talkative at that
                    age. So I said a foolish thing. Looking around the room I saw a man with a
                    rather elfin cast of countenance, and I said, “Who's that funny little man over
                    there?” And she said, “Oh, that's my husband.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you became fast friends.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: We became fast friends. Nicky and Edward used to play golf together all
                    the time. They were Belfast people, who had gone to Trinity College in Dublin,
                    and they were in the British Commonwealth Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they were in the British High Commission.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Yes. And subsequently, when they were in London and we were in Dublin, we
                    had a holiday in Donegal together. Nicky subsequently became a “Sir”, and he was
                    a High Commissioner in some of the Commonwealth countries. I stayed with them in
                    1986 in London, and I have a recent letter from them. For me, I guess, the
                    greatest gift the Foreign Service gave was friendships that lasted decades.
                    Decades without seeing each other even.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must be a good corresponder.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Once a year, usually. But I think with people with whom you have an
                    empathy, you sort of pick up where you left off, and it just goes again. The sad
                    event of our New Zealand time was the death of our little Mary at birth. I went
                    back to New Zealand in '87 and arranged with the man in charge of the cemetery
                    to put the grave in order; he sent me photographs of the grave, and every
                    Christmas we exchange greetings. I arranged through New Zealand friends to give
                    him a check every Christmas in appreciation for his looking after it all the
                    time. So I don't feel it's abandoned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It must have been terribly hard, but by then you had many
                        friends there to support you through that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Yes. I guess it's easier to accept the loss of a child before you have
                    come to know him or her. I think the older a child gets, the more you have in
                    memories. But I can still see that little face. Fortunately, I wasn't doped up
                    during labor so I was able to say, “If there's any question that this child will
                    live, I want her baptized.'' So the nurse in the maternity home flew up to the
                    church, snatched the priest off the altar, and brought him down, and Mary was
                    baptized.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>From New Zealand we were fortunate to have one of our occasional boat trips. From
                    Christchurch we went by boat to Philadelphia through the Panama Canal, on a
                    British freighter which plied between London and the Far East, and carried many
                    missionary families. So it was set up for children. There was fencing along the
                    rails, and there were gates for companionways so that you had to reach over to
                    unlatch them. So the children could run freely. There were just two families on
                    board — a young New Zealand couple coming to take up a Nilman fellowship in
                    journalism at Harvard. They had one child, and we had our three and I was
                    pregnant again. That was the whole passenger list so, of course, we all sat with
                    the captain. Our Tony had his third birthday aboard and the captain gave him a
                    birthday party. The cook made a great cake, the ship's whistle blew three times,
                    and there were balloons. And to top it off, Tony's balloon slipped his hand and
                    off it went. But a few minutes later, a sailor came down from the upper deck,
                    and said, “I saw this just floating by, and I reached out and got it.” So Tony
                    got his balloon back!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those are important memories, aren't they? Just little
                        things like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Yes. I can just see it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this ship went to Philadelphia. Where were you on your
                        way to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: We had home leave in New Hampshire, and thence to Helsinki, Finland.
                    Again we went by boat, to Bremerhaven, then to Copenhagen; and by small boat
                    (the “ferry,” as it was called) up the Baltic Sea to Helsinki.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were pregnant all this time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Yes, I was pregnant. In fact, when we arrived in Helsinki I was eight
                    months pregnant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You don't get seasick, I gather?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: No. When we were crossing the Atlantic it was approaching the time of the
                    winter solstice; and Edward and I were the only two people on board, I believe,
                    who weren't seasick.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What a constitution.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>PRINCE: It was one of those seas where you put your hands down to hold the dishes
                    on the table when the ship was pitching, and we got through it. But it was an
                    extremely tiring time, because one of the children was sick on board, and
                    another was sick in Copenhagen. So I arrived very tired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your husband helpful with the children?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Oh, sure. I think in the Foreign Service husbands were particularly
                    helpful if you didn't have full-time servants and nannies. If you had servants
                    that was one thing. But as I said, I cooked all the dinners for official
                    entertainment after we left Budapest in 1948. Sometimes for as many as 32
                    people. I prepared food for cocktail parties anywhere from 175 to, well, spread
                    over a five hour period once we invited 300, but I think only 200 came. I cooked
                    for ten days beforehand because we didn't have a cook.</p>
                <p>Our Philip was born in Helsinki, under the care of a wonderful doctor who saw me
                    initially at 7:00 at night; he was a professor at medical school, and had his
                    private practice, but when he heard we had just arrived and I was just a month
                    from delivery, he saw me then. He spent an hour and a half with me and he said,
                    “Now is there anything else you want to know, because I can stay here as long as
                    you want me to.” And when Philip was delivered he was at my side in 15 minutes,
                    and never left me. He told me afterwards, “You were so run down when I saw you I
                    wasn't sure that you would survive this.” It was wonderful. He made me stay in
                    the hospital for three weeks to get a good rest while Edward was going crazy, of
                    course, at home with the three kids.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he find anyone to help?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Well, you know, the Lord does wonderful things. Edward put an
                    advertisement in the paper, and a Finnish woman turned up who had experience
                    with emotionally-disturbed children. She had a special training and she was home
                    after having done this work in Israel for some years. The terms of the
                    advertisement, I guess, must have spoken to her generous heart, because she
                    answered it. She told me afterwards, “When I saw that poor man, and all those
                    little kids...” So she came and was there after I came home from the hospital.
                    We were living in a temporary flat that the embassy owned. The three older kids
                    were all sick, they were all in one room. There was a bad flu going around and
                    the doctor said, “You must take great care that the baby doesn't get in contact
                    with this strain.” So the three were in one room, the baby in the second
                    bedroom, and Edward and I were sleeping on a couch in the living room. And then
                    Edward got sick too. Oh, surely, haven't you encountered things like this?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I don't remember it was ever that bad.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>PRINCE: Miss Ella was simply wonderful. But then a great blow fell. An uncle of
                    hers, who was a widower, had a stroke and there was no one to care for him. So,
                    much sooner than she had anticipated, she had to leave me. Well, it was a blow
                    particularly to our number-two son, who had been traumatized by being torn up
                    from New Zealand when he was almost three, but he didn't understand why. That
                    was the only place he'd ever known; and he had come to trust at last again this
                    woman, and then she left him. So, that's one of the things the Foreign Service
                    does to kids.</p>
                <p>Through various contacts we got a house on the shores of the Gulf of Finland. The
                    best party we ever gave, in my opinion, was a Midsummer Eve party, down on the
                    shore. It's traditional in the North countries, dating from pre-Christian times.
                    A bonfire by the water is an essential part of it. We could see the fires all
                    around the bay, as we sat along the shore, singing. The Finnish guests would
                    sing some of their songs, alternating with others of us singing the songs of our
                    respective countries. (The last guests left at 5:00 a.m.! It has the longest
                    daylight of the year; the sun dips below the horizon for only about half an
                    hour, around midnight, then it's back and the birds start singing again.)
                    Although we didn't have a cook or maid there, we were very fortunate to have the
                    help of a splendid girl, trained in child care, to live in and care for the baby
                    and for the other children when we went out.</p>
                <p>In Finland our principal friendships were formed through two English-language
                    conversation groups; we met with each one once a week. We had loads of fun and
                    they included some very interesting people, including among others the sister of
                    the president; a wonderful woman scientist who was also an artist; a man who was
                    head of the health services in Finland (which certainly could be a model for
                    us); and a man who was sort of a great entrepreneur in the theatrical field. It
                    was a very diverse group; we formed wonderful friendships, and we did things
                    together. We would go to literary festivals in the country, and that kind of
                    thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a very full and wonderful life in Helsinki.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Yes, it was very rewarding, and the Finns are the staunchest of friends.
                    After that Edward had a year of a special course in economics at MIT
                    [Massachusetts Institute of Technology]. While we were there we had a visit from
                    Toini, the scientist/artist, who'd come to Cambridge for a conference. While she
                    was with us Edward was reading in the evenings to the children from the Moomin
                    stories (a well-known Finnish series for children). I'd mentioned to Toini I
                    hadn't a tea cozy, and she said to me, “Do you have a scrap bag?” So from the
                    scraps she made me a tea cozy, decorated with figures she made of the characters
                    in the Moomin stories — you see, she even had the little string of pearls for
                    Moomin Maiden. We never saw each other again after 1956, but we corresponded
                    until her death in 1983.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you live there at MIT? Was it a whole year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: That was a whole academic year. We lived in Norwood, which was an easy
                    train commute to Cambridge. I would take Edward down to the station every
                    morning and meet him in the evening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was life for you there? Could you get out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: We had four little ones, so we didn't have any social life. But we were
                    contented.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't feel isolated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: No. We were busy. We went about in the town; the two older children,
                    Noelle and Jonny, went to the elementary school, and the children had friends
                    down the road. It was near New Hampshire; and a few Massachusetts friends came
                    to visit us, including Edward's sister, whose husband taught at Mt. Holyoke. We
                    had a big rambling house with fields of daffodils back of it, where the kids had
                    a wonderful place to play.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, wonderful that you could find such a place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: It belonged to a rich family next door, who were friends of a friend of
                    Edward's parents. They had bought this small estate when the owner died because
                    they didn't want it to be sold for development, and they were willing to let it
                    to us on the say-so of Mother and Dad Prince's friend. We came on friendly terms
                    with them and a son of theirs, through whom we later made friends in other
                    places.</p>
                <p>From there we went on to Washington, where Edward served mostly on Australian-New
                    Zealand affairs. Those three years were reasonably uneventful professionally. We
                    did a modest amount of entertaining, but not so much was expected of one in that
                    area in Washington except of quite senior people. We did make some congenial
                    acquaintance with Australian Embassy folk and found some old New Zealand friends
                    in their Washington embassy. The children settled into school and neighborhood
                    friendships, and Edward and I were glad to renew contact with some old friends
                    from pre-marital days. We didn't have much opportunity to take advantage of
                    cultural activities — I remember we bought one concert series ticket and took
                    turns going to the performances (I had the joy of hearing the incomparable Glenn
                    Gould at one of them). We took the kids to some museums — I guess their favorite
                    trips were to the Smithsonian to see the dinosaurs.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you join in on the decisions on where your assignments
                        were? Or mostly did the assignments come as a surprise?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: The only time we had any input that I am aware of was when we went to
                    Ankara, later on. At that time we were in the Northern Europe - British
                    Commonwealth division of the Department. (I don't know whether the Department is
                    now organized into the same geographical divisions.) Our assignments after
                    Budapest — to Montreal, New Zealand, and Helsinki — placed us in that area, so
                    it was understandable that our next assignment was to Dublin.</p>
                <p>Since I was a child there were two places I wanted to go. One was Ireland; I came
                    of Irish stock and loved Irish poetry and songs. The other place I wanted to go
                    was Vienna, where I expected to find Beethoven and Mozart walking around; I
                    thought of it as the city of music. It seemed a dream come true, to have been in
                    Vienna during our Budapest days and now to be going to Ireland. I shall never
                    forget my first sight of Ireland. I didn't go to bed that night, because we were
                    going to come into Cobh, the port of Cork, about midnight. For a wonder there
                    was a moon — it wasn't raining! And there in the moonlight I saw the hills of
                    Ireland for the first time. I felt this atavistic surge all through me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you really felt at home there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: It's still the home of my heart. After a time my mind became attuned to
                    the Irish way of thinking (quite different from the Anglo-Saxon), and I began
                    taking on the Irish way of speech. (I guess this happens for many of us when
                    we've lived in a country for a while.) After a stay in a family hotel we were
                    fortunate to find a large and handsome house on Ailesbury Road, the 'embassy
                    row' of Dublin. It was owned by the newspaper, the Cork Examiner, whose
                    representative had used it for a time, then it was let out to a diplomatic
                    family, who was transferring. Though furnished, it was so large that we could
                    tuck our modest effects into the nooks and crannies. It had six levels; and I
                    used to go up the stairs two at a time because it was so big and there was so
                    much work I hadn't time to go up one at a time. It was very difficult until our
                    kindly neighbor, the Spanish ambassadress, sent a wonderful Spanish girl,
                    Carmela, to live with us. After a time she went back to Spain to get married,
                    and I was back to cleaning ladies again. Then I had word that she and her
                    husband, Floris, would like to return to Ireland if they could find a place
                    together. So Edward and I did a quick budget calculation and figured out the
                    maximum we could offer them: it suited, and they both came — and that made all
                    the difference in our lives. She didn't do the cooking for our official dinner
                    parties, but she helped me; and she could do the family cooking and take care of
                    the children. And she and Floris together could handle the major cleaning. And
                    the Spanish ambassadress, dear lady (she was sort of a surrogate mother to me)
                    sent her butler over to teach Floris how to serve at parties. Edward was
                    political officer, and made very effective political contacts, which we could
                    now follow up with entertaining.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>And that was where we met Tibor Paul again. Have I told you about meeting the
                    conductor we had known in Budapest?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: He had been conductor of the Radio Budapest Symphony in Hungary, and we
                    were acquainted with him, though not intimately. We heard that he was the
                    conductor of the Irish National Symphony. He was in the phone book, so I rang
                    him up. I said, “Do you remember us from Budapest?” “Mrs. Prince! Everywhere
                    I've gone I've inquired do they know where the Princes are! You must come
                    tonight. I have a place for you in my box. I will hold the concert until you
                    arrive.”</p>
                <p>So in short notice we got a baby sitter and rushed there; someone was waiting at
                    the door; “Come quick! It's time for the concert to start.” And we were whisked
                    up to the conductor's box. It turned out the family had got out of Hungary, and
                    Tibor was full-time music director for Australian National Radio Symphony, but
                    also permanent conductor in Dublin. He had a flat in Dublin, but the family was
                    in Sydney, since the two boys were at school. The natural thing was that we
                    became sort of his musical host and hostess and gave after-concert parties. How
                    exciting it was to meet these great musical artists — like Paul Badura-Skoda,
                    Hephzibah Menuhin, Rosalyn Tureck, Julius Katchen, among others. The artists
                    always had a big bowl of my home-made soup before joining the guests, since
                    musicians eat very lightly, if at all, before a performance. And we went to
                    Julius Katchen's birthday party. We became the 'artistic and musical Americans'
                    because, for some years before, the previous Ambassador and most of his staff
                    were not particularly interested in artistic and intellectual activities; they
                    were more involved with that very important aspect of Irish life, horses and
                    racing, and the social life connected with it. So when Dublin's artistic
                    community found some American Embassy people who really shared their interests,
                    we had access to all these distinguished people and wonderful events that
                    ordinarily would have been available only to higher-ranking people in the
                    embassy.</p>
                <p>A great friendship I developed in Ireland was with Mary Lavin, the writer, whom
                    we got to know because of a Norwood connection. The people who owned the house
                    we lived in in Norwood had a farm in County Meath, in Ireland; it was managed
                    for them by Tom Lavin, Mary's father. So the Norwood folk, when they knew we
                    were going to Dublin, gave us her address and said, “You must be in touch with
                    Mary.”</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>So when we got to Dublin I sent a note telling her I'd like to call on her, and I
                    got back Mary's reply. (You know how genius's handwriting is indecipherable.) It
                    appeared to be an invitation to a 'liver and cheese party'! I said to Edward,
                    “What's a liver and cheese party?” We discovered it was wine and cheese. Mary
                    had been widowed at age 39. “It was one of those bloody Irish funerals where you
                    stand around the grave in the rain. And William got pneumonia.” She had three
                    girls, one of whom was the same age as our Noelle (twelve or thirteen). So the
                    girls became friends, and I became great friends with Mary. We used to go down
                    to the country, where she had a farm beside Bective Abbey, in County Meath. It
                    was a wonderful friendship. And through her we got to know people like Frank
                    O'Connor and other authors and poets and actors. Mary used to phone me up and
                    say, “I've got this story all written except for the opening sentence, and the
                    opening sentence is critical.” So she would try different ones out on me, until
                    one seemed right.</p>
                <p>I think my most beloved friends in Ireland were Terry and Nancy O'Rafferty. Terry
                    was Permanent Secretary of Education under several Presidents and Prime
                    Ministers. He was also a distinguished scholar and active internationally, in
                    the Council of Europe and such — but the most modest of men, and filled with a
                    matchless Christian charity. Their home was always my base on subsequent visits
                    to Ireland. I remember he used to say when I came, “You are at home, Dorothy.” I
                    used to go back to Ireland every two years after we were transferred — when on
                    home leave or transfer — to keep in touch with the dear place and friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were your children in the public schools there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Yes. Though really it's not a public-school system in our sense. All the
                    schools were run by the various denominations — mainly Catholic, of course, but
                    there were others. (The mayor of Dublin in our time was Jewish.) Noelle went to
                    the Sacred Heart nuns, the female Jesuits, you could say, in the Catholic
                    Church, the intellectuals. Jonny and Tony went to Blackrock, with the Holy Ghost
                    Fathers. And little Phil went to Montessori school, with the nuns — a wonderful
                    schooling. They had great friends and a happy life.</p>
                <p>Edward was able to be very effective there. A political ambassador was appointed
                    whom the DCM had the great misfortune to put a foot wrong with, and the
                    ambassador sent him home. So there he was, a green political ambassador, without
                    a DCM, and he liked Edward and Edward was able to guide him tactfully in an
                    acceptable way. The ambassador wanted Edward to be DCM, but the Department had a
                    man who needed a final post before retirement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was your husband disappointed?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>PRINCE: Naturally he was disappointed. He was quite junior to be a DCM, of
                    course, but he had established wonderful relationships with Irish officialdom
                    and was much respected in Dublin. In any case, he had the satisfaction of being
                    able to hold the embassy staff together when they were quite demoralized by the
                    sudden eviction of the DCM; he undertook their reassurance and pulled them back
                    together again. And the ambassador continued to rely on him a good deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: He was a political officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Head of a section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: I think he constituted the section. It was not a very big staff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In addition to doing a lot of musical and artistic
                        entertaining...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: We did some volunteer work for hospitals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The embassy wives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Embassy wives.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a group of embassy wives?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Yes. The new DCM's wife asked me to look into possibilities for a wives'
                    group activity, and I turned up the hospital opportunity. The wives' group was
                    not a very big operation, however, and mostly we were left to 'do our own
                    thing.'Because there wasn't any Cultural Affairs Officer in Dublin at that time,
                    we did that aspect of entertaining, as you mentioned. But Edward had developed
                    some really wonderful contacts among Irish government and media people, so much
                    of our entertaining was politically-oriented, too.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>(What was fun, after the majority of officialdom had gone, we might gather around
                    the piano for a sing-along, or kick off our shoes and put some dance music on
                    the record player. We did that in other posts as well.) It was such a congenial
                    post, and Edward had established such splendid contacts, he was prepared to ask
                    for an extension of our posting there. However, there was a personnel change in
                    the staff about that time that made Edward's working conditions very
                    disagreeable. So we decided it was best to let the system take its course and be
                    prepared for transfer when the appropriate time came.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That must have been sad.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Yes, it was. We were fortunate, however, to have few such experiences in
                    the course of our career; others have had quite a few, and I guess no one
                    escapes them entirely. So, anyway, we got an assignment to someplace like the
                    Ivory Coast. But by that time Philip, our seven-year-old, had developed a severe
                    case of psoriasis (an inheritable chronic skin disease, a 'gift' from my
                    father's family). The embassy physician said it needed specialist attention, and
                    the dermatologist who saw it said it was the most severe case he had ever seen
                    in a child.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened with your son?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>PRINCE: The dermatologist had worked in Africa, and he said, “This child cannot
                    go to that climate.” So Edward flew to Washington with the dermatologist's
                    report, endorsed by the embassy physician, and the Department said, “Okay. We'll
                    wipe that assignment off. Where do you want to go?” (This was the only time we
                    had a choice in our assignments, which you asked about earlier.) We'd long had
                    an interest in Athens; and when we were in New Zealand a previous superior had
                    requested Edward for an assignment there, where he was DCM; but we'd already
                    been assigned to Helsinki, where they needed to fill a vacancy, and Edward
                    didn't think it fair, when things had gone so far, to ask for a cancellation of
                    that assignment, so we went to Helsinki then. At this point, however, Edward was
                    still thinking about that Middle East area. It turned out there was a vacancy in
                    the economic section in Ankara. So he phoned me up from Washington and said,
                    “What about Ankara?” and I said, “It's okay with me.” And so it turned out. It
                    happened I had to have an operation just as it was time to pack up, so we got
                    the packing done, and then I had the operation but the doctor said, “You've got
                    to wait three weeks before you travel.” So Edward and the children went ahead;
                    they went by boat to Istanbul and thence by train to Ankara. I subsequently flew
                    to join them in Ankara, receiving the red-carpet treatment, since Pan Am's
                    Dublin representative was a poker partner of Edward's. Philip was immediately
                    put into the American Air Force hospital, where the psoriasis was expertly
                    treated and cleared up, much to the pride and satisfaction of the Army
                    dermatologist.Then to find a house. As I mentioned, the only place that we had
                    an embassy-owned house was in New Zealand. In other places we found our own, and
                    we would get it by word of mouth very often. We were in a temporary flat for a
                    while, and then we got a house. At that time, Philip went to an American school
                    for military dependents, which was available to all Americans. He'd just turned
                    eight. He came home from school after a few days and said, “Mom, we already
                    finished in Ireland what they'll still be doing at the end of our book here;
                    it's so boring.” Friends at the embassy said, “Why don't you think about sending
                    him either to the French, or the German schools?” Both were there under the
                    sponsorship of their respective governments, and several embassy kids went
                    there. We investigated, and the German school said, “He's already ahead of his
                    age group; we will take him but we won't grade him for the first year, and we
                    will find you one of the teachers to tutor him. He can attend the classes, have
                    the tutoring, and then by the end of the year he should be able to get into the
                    substance of it.” I didn't know a word of German, neither did Edward. But
                    Edward, being the sort of person he was, had a fat German dictionary. I trotted
                    down to the book store and got a pocket dictionary for Phil. I said, “I'll tell
                    you what, Phil; give it a try 'til Christmas and then if you find it's just too
                    much, you can go back to the American school; but you're bored there now, so why
                    not give it a try.” Night after night he would bring home his homework, and we'd
                    be looking up things in the dictionary. But they were wonderful at the school,
                    and it was just a five-minute walk from our house. It was on the German embassy
                    grounds; they had playing fields. It was just great. And down the road from us
                    was the German Political Counselor whose youngest son became Phil's best friend,
                    and for whose wedding Phil was best man three years ago, right here in New
                    Hampshire; a German-American couple, they had one wedding here.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really. You are steadfast with your friendships.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Anyway, at Christmas time, after Phil had struggled through, and there
                    were some tears, I still held the promise for him that he could do what he
                    wanted. After the school's Christmas party in the German embassy, where they had
                    a tall tree in the great hall, lots of chocolate bars for everybody, a gift for
                    everybody, singing, and general jollity, Phil came home and said, “Gee Mom, this
                    is the best school I ever saw.” So from that time onward, until he entered
                    college, Phil went to German schools, in German language, for all except one
                    year. He continued in Tehran, and subsequently in Potomac, outside
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>We lived in three countries of the Finno-Ugric language group: Hungary, Finland,
                    and Turkey. And while there was only one word that they all had in common that I
                    could identify (the word for “water,” su) they were structured similarly with
                    suffixes added onto the root word — agglutinative, I believe such languages are
                    called.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that right? Because you always think of Hungarian as
                        like nothing else at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: They all had a common origin, I think, in the wilds of Central Asia. I
                    studied the Turkish language. I loved it. It was so easy to construct because it
                    was so regular. For three years I went to classes, and eventually was able to
                    conduct non-technical conversations. The Turkish people, I just love. Next to
                    Dublin... well, it's hard to choose favorites, but I think Turkey was the second
                    favorite. The character of the people is so fine. They're so staunch, they're
                    the truest of friends. I had ten Turkish lady friends. It fell to me to organize
                    English-Conversation groups for 200 Turkish ladies, and to recruit American
                    women to lead them. I myself had a group of ten, who came to my house for three
                    years every Wednesday morning — except during summer holidays. Not only did they
                    make real progress in speaking English but we became the warmest of friends. We
                    did such fun things.</p>
                <p>I'll always have the mental picture of one particular event. I had an evening
                    dress I'd got in London, a sheer chiffon with a silk slip of the same style; it
                    had a skirt (double!) yea wide, and it was too long. I couldn't get anyone in
                    Dublin to shorten it. “Mrs. Prince, I'd have to charge you ten pounds to do
                    that.” “I'm sorry, I just haven't the time.” And so on. I thought, “What am I
                    going to do with this thing?” So I said to my ladies, “Do you know a seamstress
                    who would shorten this for me?” The next week two of the women came early, and
                    they said, “Put on that dress and stand up on the dining room table.” They
                    pinned up the hem and that of the underskirt. Then the rest of the ladies came,
                    with needles and thread. They said, “Let's put two card tables together.” Then
                    we spread out the skirt and all of us sat around and took a section — and we
                    hemmed that dress!</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>We used to go to the bazaar, and to interesting places in the old quarter of
                    Ankara. As my departure day approached they said, “We're going to have a party.”
                    On the day they arrived with all sorts of delicacies. We lit up the grill, made
                    shish kabob, and sat around and ate and talked until late afternoon. We all felt
                    so sad. I just loved them so much. I left Ankara before the rest of the family,
                    going ahead to spend my usual two or three weeks in Ireland before joining the
                    others on home leave. My plane was due to leave at 7:30 a.m., and the airport
                    was 18 miles from the city. Five minutes after Edward and I arrived at the
                    airport, up drove a minibus with my ten Turkish lady friends, to bid me farewell
                    and give me one final gift. They said, “You must come back and spend two weeks
                    with Mebrure, two weeks with Sevinc, two weeks with Ayfer, two with Durdane, and
                    so on with the whole group. I really feel I'll love them as long as I live, and
                    they will love me. I've tried a few times to be in touch with them, but street
                    addresses are no good, and I didn't know their post office box numbers; I tried
                    ringing one or another of them when I was on a plane that touched down at Ankara
                    airport. But no success. And the only friend who was there in my time had left
                    by the time I sent her a letter to deliver. So I just hold them in my heart.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sure. They know that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: My organizational talents were really used to the full in Ankara. I had a
                    call from the president of the American Women's Club one morning saying, “Could
                    you possibly take charge of our fair this year?” They had a fair every year
                    which raised money for local charitable projects. Somebody else was going to do
                    it and got transferred, or sick, or something. So, anyway, this project ended up
                    involving 200 people — I got something for everybody — a folk dance group,
                    music, food, raffles, games, everything. We even had on hand a couple of medical
                    corpsmen and an ambulance in case anybody was taken ill. I spent six weeks
                    getting it together; and without the help of a wonderful woman, whose husband
                    was with AID and who had been in public relations, I just couldn't have managed
                    it. We conferred on the phone every morning during those six weeks, and we made
                    $4,000.Also, occasionally the ambassador's wife got me to organize teas for
                    Turkish government ladies, and that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you like doing all that kind of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: The ambassador's wife's things?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>PRINCE: Fortunately, that was the only place where I had to do much of that. You
                    know you always have to turn up at the cocktail parties; but that was really the
                    only place I had to do much of the extras. And as it happened, the wife for whom
                    I mostly did it, I liked very much indeed. But, if I'd had to do a lot of it, I
                    would have hated it. I like to do things with the people of the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But also, I was wondering since you were yourself about to
                        become a Foreign Service Officer, did you ever have moments of thinking, “I
                        wish it was I that was doing the substantive stuff.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Yes, but fleetingly, because we had contacts with people of considerable
                    intellectual quality, and I was never relegated to the corner to talk about
                    babies and cookery with the women. I had the stimulation of being accepted in
                    political and cultural conversations and contacts. I think if I hadn't had some
                    of the opportunities that I had to do satisfying work, from a personal,
                    emotional, and intellectual standpoint, that I would have been dissatisfied.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But what interests me is that you say you had the
                        opportunities; but everyone has the opportunities yet some people don't grab
                        them as well as I think you did. I wonder why that was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Well, I think it was because I needed to use my own creativity. I had an
                    active head, and I needed to use it; and there were things to be done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You threw yourself into it, and had a wonderful time! Did
                        you ever feel anything about that 1972 Directive. At one point the wives
                        were part of the team, and written up on the husband's efficiency report, as
                        you mentioned in Montreal; and then in 1972 it was decided to not mention
                        them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: I remember that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were back in Washington by then, weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>PRINCE: Yes, we were back in the States. Although I think it must be clear to you
                    that I'm a strong-minded woman, I felt it was a great mistake. I think that the
                    Foreign Service used to get two for the price of one, and the women did things
                    that the men couldn't do. The women were instrumental often in creating the
                    bonds of familiarity through the friendships with the wives that then would
                    bring the husbands together. And I think that a man who was at post without his
                    wife, didn't begin to get the same depth of contact. I suppose it was considered
                    by the nascent femininist revolution that it was important to distinguish
                    between the two, but I think the Foreign Service lost. I don't know whether you
                    had the experience of the before-and-after yourself. Did you?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, we did.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Did you have any sense of that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I did in a way. In retrospect anyway, I agree with you
                        that it was a wrong thing to do. But at the time I think you're swept up in
                        it, and we thought, “Oh, yes. We should maybe be paid, or be recognized, or
                        something.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Yes. You know, it would say on the efficiency report, his wife is a great
                    asset. Well, that was okay because you knew what you were doing, and you saw the
                    benefits. You knew what it was giving you. If I'd been 30 years younger and had
                    come in at a time when the women's movement was swinging, I might have been all
                    for separate recognition. You know, all great social movements at their
                    beginnings, swing to the far extreme; and then they gradually come to a
                    reasonable mid-point. But, I think, as a team, as in our day, we were more
                    effective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't have the feeling ever that you resented being
                        the “wife of?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Oh, I was never taken that way. I was always me. I was always as
                    talkative, and jumping in all over, as you see me. Our ambassadors were all
                    pretty nice men. And I was spared much contact with difficult wives, and there
                    were only a couple of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dragon ladies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Yes, as I said, there were a couple of those. If we had been more senior
                    at one of those posts, I might have “got hit.” The DCM's wife at one post, a
                    lovely lady, really had kind of a bad time. The ambassador's wife was very
                    demanding, and made life difficult for her. If I had had experience like that,
                    my view might be different.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the other hand, it might not have happened to you. You
                        might have been able to cut it off at the beginning.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: The ambassador's position, I think, is like an absolute monarchy; oddly
                    enough, I think it tends to affect the wives more than the ambassadors. One
                    ambassador's wife drank nothing but champagne and was so insensitive as not only
                    to expect junior staff to have it on hand when she came to their houses, but to
                    request it at cocktail parties given by people of the host country, putting them
                    to great embarrassment if they couldn't provide it, because they had a tradition
                    of hospitality which was a matter of honor. Another ambassador's wife held
                    regular wives' meetings; I was newly arrived and close to time of having a baby;
                    I told the secretary who phoned me that I had a doctor's appointment that
                    morning and she said, “Shall I tell Mrs. so-and-so you're unable to cancel?” So
                    I canceled, having been warned of the lady's temperament.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you rode through those things with a great deal of
                        grace.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Actually I had very, very little of it. Some people really did have hard
                    times. We've rather got away from Ankara, haven't we? Let's see, what else
                    happened there? Well, we traveled a lot; whenever the children had a school
                    vacation we took a trip — the country is so beautiful and diverse, there are
                    marvelous archeological sites, and the people were always so warm and welcoming.
                    And I was involved in church things, women's organizations, singing in choir,
                    etc. Altogether, I loved Turkey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think your religion has been very important for
                        you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Oh, yes, it has. How do you know that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It shines out from you. That also must be a great help as
                        you move around. I mean, it must be hard for people who don't have that
                        sense that you do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Life is difficult anyway, perhaps a bit more so in the Foreign Service. I
                    think it must be harder for people who don't have some concept of a spiritual
                    meaning to it. And some religious practice, not necessarily orthodox, is an
                    important support, I believe.</p>

                <p>PRINCE: It's interesting you should mention that, because the most important
                    decision I guess I ever had to face hinged upon my discovering how important
                    that was, after I'd thought it through in my adulthood. Our children all had a
                    church-related upbringing, and it left them with a sense of the importance of a
                    spiritual life. In adulthood they found their own paths — Buddhism, born-again
                    Christianity, committed Socialism. I respect the integrity of their choices and
                    pray that the Lord will lead them to their destined ends.</p>
                <p>From Ankara we went to Tehran. Iran was a wonderful experience, but it was the
                    one place where I think most of us at the embassy felt, and regretted, that it
                    was very difficult to make more than surface friendships, because of the
                    character of Iranian life: the demands of the Iranian family were such that
                    there really wasn't time for Iranians to spend with foreigners to the extent
                    that real friendships could develop. (Some missionaries who'd been there for 20
                    or more years had formed friendships, but mainly with Persian Christians.) I
                    took courses for a couple of years at university there. There was a center for
                    Middle Eastern and Islamic studies, conducted by a brilliant professor (who
                    spoke better English than me); he taught at Harvard, at Oxford, as well as in
                    Persia and many other countries. A devout man as well as a great scholar, he
                    wanted to explain Islam and the history and culture of the Middle East to
                    interested and respectful foreigners. It was a great privilege to study under
                    him.</p>
                <p>Though an amateur, I played the organ and led a small choir at the
                    English-speaking Catholic chapel attended by a large part of the foreign
                    Catholic residents in Tehran as well as the few Iranian Catholics. One Christmas
                    it was a lot of fun for our choir to do a program of songs from all the
                    nationalities represented in the congregation. Our pastor was an American priest
                    who had served as a missionary abroad since 1929. He regretted when the liturgy
                    was changed to be said in the vernacular; he said his Brooklyn accent became
                    evident when he spoke English — but I reminded him he spoke Latin with a
                    Brooklyn accent also!</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>One of the most rewarding experiences I was ever involved in was the attempt to
                    establish a YWCA in Tehran — at the request of the Government. (In retrospect
                    I'm inclined to believe they wanted a YWCA hostel, as a tourist amenity, and
                    hadn't considered it would involve program.) The President of Damavand College
                    for women asked me if I'd like to help in the effort. (This was an American
                    woman educator; the college, established by Presbyterian missioners, had
                    subsequently been given over to Persian administration, but they still usually
                    filled its presidency with a professional from abroad. Many women in
                    professional life in Iran had attended Damavand, including Empress Farah.) I
                    should mention that foreign missioners were welcome as teachers, doctors, etc.,
                    but not allowed actively to proselytize. Their converts I think were attracted
                    by their good works. I had wonderful opportunities to work and become friends
                    with Persian Christian women (Presbyterian, Anglican, Orthodox, Chaldean) as
                    well as German, French, British and other foreign Christian women resident in
                    Iran. The woman who'd been head of women's activities for the Presbyterian
                    Mission for 23 years and I mostly wrote the constitution, got it accepted by the
                    International headquarters in Switzerland, persuaded the U.S. YWCA to fund an
                    executive secretary for three years — all set up then to be what the government
                    had asked for. But what they hadn't counted on was that, of course, there's more
                    than a hostel. There's a program. And a provision was that, as associates,
                    Moslem young women could take advantage of the programs. They didn't have to be
                    Christians. And secondly, there was the provision that if the association
                    dissolved, its assets would revert to the international YWCA.</p>
                <p>Well, this constitution shuttled back and forth among offices in the Iranian
                    government seeking official approval. I think it's generally true in the Middle
                    East (where they used to chop your head off if you made a wrong official
                    decision) that in any tricky situation, nobody wanted to be the one to put the
                    okay on it. Eventually the executive secretary arrived from New York, all ready
                    to get going, and the constitution was still floating around. We finally
                    recognized that nobody was going to sign it because it could be controversial.
                    They hadn't realized it was going to be anything more than an amenity that would
                    be an asset to the tourist business. After some months of waiting around, the
                    executive secretary returned to New York, and we dismantled the operation — and
                    dissolved ourselves as officers and board. But the experience had provided me
                    some wonderful associations with Christian women of various churches and
                    nationalities. I didn't begrudge the time and effort I'd expended. I did deeply
                    regret that it came to naught.</p>
                <p>The missioners had done splendid work in Iran, building hospitals and schools.
                    The northern and northeastern areas of the country were mostly served by the
                    Presbyterians, with a few Evangelical enclaves. From Tehran south to Isfahan and
                    thereabout was Anglican territory. The German Lutherans also were active there.
                    Gradually they involved and in some cases eventually turned over the
                    administration of their facilities to Iranian auspices.</p>

                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>PRINCE: Noelle was at Manhattanville College, where she graduated in 1969. Jonny
                    had gone to Mount Hermon prep school, in Massachusetts, and then on to Antioch
                    College. Tony graduated from Community School, in Tehran (established by the
                    Presbyterian mission group but by that time under Persian administration); the
                    teachers were mostly British or American, and instruction was in English. He
                    went then to Lake Forest College, in Illinois. So by 1968 only Phil was still
                    with us in Tehran; he was able to go into German secondary school there — just a
                    five-minute bike ride from home. He had a very happy time there, with a
                    congenial school atmosphere and lots of friends who lived nearby. I remember, at
                    a parent-teacher meeting at the school there, asking his home-room teacher how
                    Phil was doing, and he replied, “Like a fish in water!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the other children went to school in mostly American
                        schools, or international in English?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Except for Phil they all went to school in English, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And, over all, some of your children, would you say,
                        enjoyed the Foreign Service growing up — your daughter more than your sons,
                        perhaps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: Yes, because she was in English-speaking countries, or with an
                    English-speaking community until she entered college. She went to the American
                    School in Ankara and formed some long-lasting friendships there. For her I would
                    say it was pretty comfortable. For Philip, in the German school, I can say the
                    same. For Tony, the uprootings were more traumatic. He had a couple of good
                    friends in Ankara, with whom he made back-packing bus trips around the country.
                    They had some great experiences with the local Turkish people. They were allowed
                    to use the room at a mosque which was kept for travelers, and they spread their
                    sleeping bags there. They bought freshly-caught fish from fishermen and cooked
                    them on a fire on the beach. At an Army post they were taken in and fed and
                    given sleeping quarters by the soldiers; Tony took some photos of some of these
                    young fellows and sent them to them. He hated leaving Ankara. Tehran is a huge
                    city, and students lived at such distances from each other that it was difficult
                    to get together frequently and form intimate relationships.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they close to each other, your children?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: You mean, were they intimate with each other?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Intimate, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>PRINCE: While we were all together, I guess they were, though each had his or her
                    own circles of friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Are they now? Do they keep in touch closely?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: One is in California, one in North Carolina, one in Virginia, and one
                    (Phil) completing graduate school in Massachusetts — after which he will take a
                    job in Japan. Jonny works for the State, in Sacramento; Tony, a Socialist, has
                    an industrial job in North Carolina; Noelle, the wife of a professor at
                    Hampden-Sydney College, in Virginia, has her master's degree in dance, and
                    teaches, performs, and choreographs — while not neglecting a four-year old son;
                    and Philip will be a landscape architect. But they do all maintain a feeling of
                    loyalty to each other, yes, they do. When Noelle was married, Jonny came from
                    California to give her away. When Jonny was married, in California, Phil
                    couldn't come, from Georgia, but flowers from him arrived on the wedding
                    morning. And when Edward died, all, of course, came — Jonny from California,
                    Tony from Texas, Phil from Georgia, Noelle from Ohio. They all gathered here,
                    and Jonny spoke at Edward's funeral. (Someone said to me afterwards, “That was
                    the only joyful funeral I ever attended.” And, although I didn't feel very
                    joyful, leaving the service with tears running down my face, I joined in singing
                    a happy hymn of praise that was Edward's favorite. It was a celebration of his
                    life, I guess.) Two years later, when I was selling the house, I wanted us all
                    to have one last Christmas together, in the home Edward and I had made; so all
                    of them came, along with Jonny's wife and Noelle's husband. So they do have a
                    feeling of loyalty and family feeling, but they don't see each other much, and I
                    don't see much of them either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long ago did he die?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PRINCE: He died in 1980, after just six and a half years of retirement. His last
                    assignment, following Iran, had been in the Department, where he was in the
                    section on Refugee Affairs. He had an occasional field trip, like to the Sudan,
                    but mostly was in Washington, from 1970 to 1973. By that time he had decided to
                    retire. Because of his five years of service as a Navy flyer in World War II he
                    was able to take early retirement. He was eager to build his own house and be
                    part of a community; all the children were in this country and his widowed
                    elderly mother needed care. Since his death it's too lonely a situation for me
                    here, despite involvement in community activities. Our choice of location wasn't
                    thought out for the long run, when one of us would be alone. Attending events
                    and visiting friends involves a lot of driving and time, and weather sometimes
                    frustrates plans. I'd advise retiring couples to choose a larger town, where
                    people live closer together. I miss seeing my little California granddaughters
                    and Virginia grandson very often. But I guess a lot of people have widely
                    scattered families.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>Looking back, though, on our Foreign Service years, I am grateful we were able to
                    spend our working lives in such worthwhile work, in which I served with Edward
                    as part of a 'team'. And for the privilege of living with people of other
                    countries and cultures as a neighbor, not a tourist. But especially for the
                    strong, deep friendships we made, which endure to this day, despite the
                    separation of time and distance.</p>
