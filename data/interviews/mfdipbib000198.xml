                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could give me a little about your
                        background. Where did you come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Well, I was born here in Washington, DC</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good God!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: A native Washingtonian. I went to public school here. My father at that
                    time was working for the Brookings Institute as an economist. Then things
                    transpired and we moved to Columbus, Ohio, where he taught at Ohio State
                    University. Lived there for quite a number of years, then went to Baltimore.</p>
                <p>During the Depression, things were pretty rough. My father had lost his job at
                    Ohio State, and we were trying to handle things in ways that kept body and soul
                    together. I graduated from high school in Baltimore, and then went back to Ohio
                    State for my freshman year in university, and then came back to Washington to go
                    to George Washington University.</p>
                <p>I went to high school at Baltimore City College, which was a public school, 3,500
                    boys, all white, but it was a school that cut across all sorts of boundaries. It
                    was, then, an excellent school.</p>
                <p>My mother took me to a talk my Sumner Wells, who was then deputy secretary of
                    state, and he was a Baltimorean. And that got me interested in the Foreign
                    Service, in part. Also I was interested in the Spanish Civil War that was then
                    being fought.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was late '30s.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>CHASE: My father and mother argued about which one of them got me interested in
                    the Foreign Service. My mother went back to Sumner Wells, and my father talked
                    about my interest and concern in the early '20s for the starving Romanians. That
                    may be “starving Armenians,” but as I've always told the story, it was the
                    “starving Romanians.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you finish college, or did the unpleasantness in
                        Europe interrupt this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: No, I graduated in 1942 from George Washington University in a school of
                    Foreign Service. I was working at the time down at the Naval Ordnance Laboratory
                    in the Mine Countermeasures Unit. Had a Nobel Prize fellow, John Bardine, as my
                    boss. Then as I graduated, I wanted to leave where I was doing just clerical
                    work, and got a job in the War Shipping Administration as a junior economist. I
                    lost my draft deferment and ended up in the Coast Guard. I ended up in a part of
                    the Coast Guard called the Off-Shore Picket Patrol, and we were out there
                    looking for submarines—but we were using sailboats.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good gosh!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: And we were sailing along off New York Harbor a hundred miles or so,
                    getting out into the Gulf Stream, with sound gear. And we would be posted out
                    there listening for suspicious motors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the sailboat because of the lack of engine noise, or
                        just because they didn't have enough of the other kind of boats?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: We didn't have any boats that would go out there and stay. We had
                    motorboats that could churn up a lot of water, but they couldn't stay more than
                    a few hours. We could stay for two weeks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ah, I got you. So you did that for...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: For three years. It was great in the summertime, and in wintertime it was
                    a little bit uncomfortable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you continue your interest in sailing, or did this
                        take care of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: I was out sailing just a few weeks ago on a 50-foot Hinkley. And I've
                    sailed, in the Foreign Service, in Hamburg, Germany; Basra, Iraq; and the
                    Philippines.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The war was over in '45. What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: I was in the Coast Guard and was getting rather bored. They told me,
                    because of my bad eyesight, I was going to be put ashore, to do just shore-type
                    work. And that wasn't going to be any fun. This was in November '44 and they
                    were cutting back on all sorts of things. Then the Battle of the Bulge came off
                    and a few other things. But they told me that if I would get a job that would
                    have me go overseas, particularly in a combat zone, I would be given a discharge
                    from the Coast Guard.</p>
                <p>So I came down to Washington. My father was then working in the government. I had
                    a friend who had joined the Diplomatic Couriers, and I thought well, maybe he
                    could get me into the Courier Service. My father talked to some people, and he
                    was told that the State Department was hiring vice consuls auxiliary.</p>
                <p>The personnel office for the State Department was then in the Walker-Johnson
                    Building on New York Avenue. The office for hiring the vice consuls auxiliary
                    was on the Second Floor, and the office for the Diplomatic Couriers was on the
                    Fifth Floor, so I got to the Second Floor and didn't get any further.</p>
                <p>It was some months later before I finally did get out. I was interviewed, I
                    think, in November, and just before Christmas I got an official invitation to
                    join the vice consuls auxiliary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were they looking for? Did you have any idea, when
                        they were interviewing you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Join the Foreign Service. Some people were being sent out for doing all
                    sorts of things. See, they hadn't had a Foreign Service examination. There
                    hadn't been any recruitment to the professional service since 1941.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we're talking about early '45, is this right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Yes, it was early '45 when I reported for work here. The day of
                    Roosevelt's funeral. They marched along and everybody was let out, so my first
                    day of work I had half a day holiday. That was, I think, a Friday. We did, then,
                    work on Saturdays, and it was either a Friday or Saturday that I went to
                    work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any particular training before you were sent
                        out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>CHASE: I went to see a fellow by the name of Walton Ferris. He was the one who
                    interviewed me. When I got out of the Coast Guard, I was still in my sailor
                    suit. He asked to see my discharge papers. I don't know if you know, but sailor
                    suits don't have very many pockets. Well, I had to struggle around getting my
                    wallet out, and in the course of putting things back together, my wallet fell on
                    the floor and things rolled out, including the lucky coin that I had been
                    carrying. I was told by Ferris to go up and get some civilian clothes and then
                    come back to see him. So I asked the secretary there if she'd be so kind to look
                    underneath the radiator for my lucky coin. She did. I went back then, about four
                    or five days after I was in the State Department. I was then in a civilian suit,
                    and I went in to see the secretary and she had my coin. Well, I was a bachelor,
                    and this was an attractive, interesting girl, and I was just back in Washington
                    and didn't know anybody, no women. So I was flipping my coin, talking to this
                    girl, and all of a sudden Walton Ferris came back into the room. He looked at
                    me: “How would you like to go to Basra?”</p>
                <p>“Where's Basra?”</p>
                <p>“It's in Iraq.”</p>
                <p>I was a little embarrassed to say I couldn't even think where Iraq was. I did
                    know where Iran was. And I also knew that a Millsbaugh Commission had gone
                    there, to see the war that had broken out. Not necessarily that my lucky coin
                    was involved, but at least that had kept me dawdling in his office. I think
                    Ferris had just come back from a meeting where they had learned that another
                    vice consul auxiliary, who had been in training for eight, ten months to go to
                    Basra, had gone off on his final leave before departing, and they had received a
                    telegram that day saying that he was joining the ministry instead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there you were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: They said, “Oh, if you're going to Basra...” I then was told to go to FSI,
                    which was in the basement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: FSI being the Foreign Service Institute.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: And go into training. They had a class there, and I went down to join this
                    class. It was a month's course, and I got, I think, two weeks or less. About the
                    only thing I got was a trip to New York City, where we were taken aboard some
                    freighters that were going around the world carrying cargo, to see what the
                    Coast Guard did, signing off papers. So then about four weeks after I got in the
                    State Department, I went up to La Guardia Airport and took a plane going to
                    Basra, Iraq.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did one go to Basra? The war was just over, in Europe,
                        wasn't it?.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: The war was just over, in Europe; still in Japan. We flew out to Basra on
                    an old DC-5, I think it was. It was an uncomfortable, four-motored plane, flying
                    down to Bermuda for dinner. Then we flew all night and got to the Azores in the
                    morning, and the next evening we arrived at Casablanca. Stayed in Casablanca for
                    a couple of days till they could get another plane to fly me on to Cairo. I
                    stayed in Cairo for about ten days before my number came up for a flight on to
                    Abadan, where we had a big air base. People then were moving military equipment
                    and personnel from Europe out to the Far East. So Cairo was a very busy hub, and
                    Abadan was a big air base.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you sort of melded into the system when you hit
                        Iraq? Abadan was actually in Iran, but then how about with Iraq?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: The border didn't exist in those days. We had military troops all over.
                    We'd just get in a car and drive across to Iran or Iraq. So a fellow from the
                    consulate drove down, which is about a two-hour drive over a desert road, and he
                    picked me up at the airport. I could telephone him from the airport and say,
                    “I'm here.” So they car came down, and I arrived. This was in the first of June,
                    and it was damn hot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I spent two and a half years in Dhahran; the
                        summers—it was warm. What type of work were you doing in our consulate in
                        Basra, and how did you fit within the consulate there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: It was an intriguing sort of experience. The principal officer, Les
                    Sutton, was a very bright but a brittle personality. The fellow that I was sort
                    of replacing, Les Stratton, was another character. And Sutton and Stratton had
                    had periods of bitter feuding, in which they didn't talk to one another except
                    on official business. There was a young woman there by the name of Betty Morley,
                    who comes from Orleans, Vermont, and she had arrived about two months before I
                    had. There was supposed to be a third officer coming out, but nobody knew: Was I
                    the third officer and somebody else to replace Stratton or not? I don't
                    know.</p>
                <p>In any case, when I arrived Sutton was so glad to see that Stratton was
                    departing, and I was completely new and anxious to do anything. Sutton was about
                    thirty, I was twenty-five, a generation apart but we got along together very,
                    very well. I like and admired Les Sutton very much.</p>
                <p>The work I was doing, I did strict consular work of visas, shipping and seamen,
                    some administrative work. My title was to do economic work.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>The post was an interesting post, and in some respects I think it was a marvelous
                    place to have as my first experience. We went off to Kuwait when they opened up
                    the oil wells. We were down there.</p>
                <p>Our consular district, which had included Dhahran, where you were, had shrunk, so
                    that we covered southern Iraq, Abadan, Khorramshahr, and Kuwait. And you say,
                    well, how could we go into these other political jurisdictions? We did! And we
                    signed off as United States consuls. I was the vice consul, n�he consul.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about dealing with the Iranians and Iraqis? Was this a
                        time when, you might say, things were almost brushed aside, because of the
                        war and because of our presence there, or were there problems in dealing
                        with the local authorities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: At that time the prestige of the United States was so great that anyone
                    moving about with the officials colors of the United States government was given
                    a tremendously warm welcome. Everybody tried to be helpful. They also continued
                    to do those things that they had always been doing. The Iraqis and Iranians were
                    basically compatible. There was a certain degree of friction. There was concern
                    about the amount of goods that we brought in from the air base.</p>
                <p>The customs officer, a guy by the name of Ringrow, an elderly British man who was
                    chief of customs for Iraq (the whole country), did a very nice job of allowing
                    us to do our thing. He had confidence that we weren't doing anything illegal,
                    yet there was concern about what the Iraqis and Iranians were doing, in the
                    sense of trade. Because sugar was rationed, gasoline was rationed, Scotch was
                    rationed. The people were living very close. They didn't have very much in the
                    way of clothing. All of the Iraqis and the British officials were wearing suits
                    and dresses that predated the war. The port authority was the main thing. Basra
                    Port was a big port, it handled all the imports. They also controlled the whole
                    Shatt al-Arab, so that anything going to Abadan had to have a certain amount of
                    clearance with the Iraqis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much of a problem with American crews
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Yes, we did have a problem with American crews. The American ship captains
                    would come in and want to file a note of protest.</p>
                <p>“What do you mean a note of protest?”</p>
                <p>“A protest!”</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>— “Having experienced rough and boisterous weather and fearing damage to ship
                    and/or cargo, I hereforth enter this note of protest.” —</p>
                <p>You know, that official...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, there's a bit of jargon which helps you if there are
                        any damaged goods, for insurance matters.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: And then there are crew list visas that had to be stamped. Also a number
                    of disciplinary problems coming up. One crewman, coming off the boat in Basra,
                    met a prostitute and wanted to give her a little present, so he went back to his
                    boat and got a portable radio. And the Iraqi customs officer said, “What are you
                    doing? You can't bring that into the country. You don't have clearance. If you
                    want to pay customs on it, fine.”</p>
                <p>Well, this sailor got irritated with the customs official carrying out his duty,
                    and so he picked up the radio and banged it over the customs official's
                    head.</p>
                <p>Well, the sailor was a big, strapping guy and the customs officer was fairly
                    small, and his head was damaged. Well, the sailor was arrested, and so constant
                    telephone calls: “We want a consul! We want to get out of here!”</p>
                <p>We went up and represented him at the hearing. And the sailor was treated so
                    gently, I thought it was criminal that this fellow was allowed to get away with
                    it.</p>
                <p>We had, also, among the sailors themselves, they'd run into battles. I was called
                    off several times to go down to Khorramshahr to settle disputes where the crew
                    refused to sail with the captain any longer. They said he was a danger to his
                    ship.</p>
                <p>We had some very colorful captains. Some captains would come back, every few
                    months they were back there, ran a perfect ship, they were a delight to know,
                    and never had a bit of trouble. They all got the sailors from the same pool, and
                    why one captain had constant trouble and the other one didn't, I think it's
                    management skills.</p>
                <p>But going back to Iraqi, Iranian dealings. Yes, there was a degree of tension,
                    because of Iraq being a government where all high officials were Sunni. The
                    fellahin, the laboring class, was predominantly Shiite. And the Shiite had an
                    emotional tie over to Iran, and there were quite a number of Iranian citizens
                    there. We also had a bunch of Armenians, about 10,000 Armenians. And the
                    Russians came down and were trying to attract these people to emigrate back to
                    their homeland in Armenia.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The war was over rather shortly thereafter. At one point
                        this was the major port for aid to the Soviet Union, and then all of a
                        sudden it was cut off practically in midstream. Did this affect you? Was
                        there a change in attitude towards the Soviet Union among you and the rest
                        there or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: The Soviet ambassador made a couple of trips to Basra. He was staying, the
                    first time, at the Basra Airport Hotel, and I went out there with Lester Sutton
                    to call on him. We also met a number of the higher Iraqi officials.</p>
                <p>I was very interested, watching the ambassador pouring whiskey for us all. The
                    Iraqi official indicated: No, no, he was Muslim, he couldn't drink.</p>
                <p>But then the Soviet said, “Well, here, just to make us all feel comfortable, I'll
                    put this glass in front of you.” And the glass was emptied.</p>
                <p>The Soviet then put some more in, he was giving us all a little bit, and the
                    Iraqi protested—a little feebly.</p>
                <p>And then about the third time the Soviet's hand went to the bottle, the Iraqi's
                    hand went to his glass to hold it out.</p>
                <p>I was interested in that bit of liquid diplomacy.</p>
                <p>What the Soviet was coming down there for I don't know. He didn't really tell us,
                    other than just wanting to see the country. There were the Armenians out there,
                    and I think he was looking the ground over altogether.</p>
                <p>And then, oh, about a year later, I went over to Ahv z in Iran, which was the
                    provincial capital. They have a Soviet consulate general there, and I went in
                    and called on them, and called on the British and the French. They were all
                    extremely hospitable to us, but by that time the shades of the Cold War were
                    beginning, that we were suspicious of them.</p>
                <p>But I might say that the Soviets were the most lavish in treating Bob Shot and
                    myself. We were both vice consuls, and we also got the letter treatment. And I
                    was wondering, after we toasted each other and ate and drank and talked about
                    all sorts of things, as we were getting ready to go, they began asking us
                    questions about how many British troops were there in the Basra area? And the
                    bridge down there, could that carry a tank?</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>Well, then, on the international diplomacy. Iran and the British were having
                    troubles over the AIOC, Anglo-Iranian Oil Company. This was long before
                    Mossadegh, but some of the same sorts of tensions. The British, to the horror of
                    the United States, brought in several divisions of troops. They hadn't told
                    Washington anything. They had brought them all into southern Iraq, and we got
                    involved in trying to find out how many British were there. They told us, in
                    Basra, well, Washington has been briefed. We then heard from George Allen, who
                    was our ambassador in Iran at the time, that the United States didn't know what
                    was happening. So we began scouring around trying to find out just exactly who
                    was there and what were the plans.</p>
                <p>And lo and behold, we met a young American, who was in the Indian Army. He had
                    come out to the Middle East in 1939 with the old ambulance corps and had run all
                    over the Middle East in the ambulance corps. When the United States got into the
                    war, he had joined the Indian Army as a military police officer. In the course
                    of things, he came into the consulate to say hello to us, and he began reeling
                    off to us all the military units that were there and what was their equipment.
                    He had it all at his fingertips.</p>
                <p>So we were the ones who were able to get the message into Washington, telling
                    them what was there, what was planned, whether there were any more coming.</p>
                <p>In Iraq and in Iran and these other things, our responsibilities were trying to
                    help promote the economy of Iraq, and also trying to find ways we could get a
                    better hold on the economy with respect to the British. Prior to 1946, the
                    British were the only ones allowed to have an ambassador in Baghdad.</p>
                <p>We could not have any representation in Kuwait. And we were trying to find ways
                    to know what was going on in Kuwait and what was happening with the oil
                    development. They were doing lots of oil exploration, some of this being done by
                    American groups. And we were trying to channel this into the State
                    Department.</p>
                <p>We were trying to find out about domestic peace and quiet in Iran and Iraq. Every
                    once in a while, people of little tribes were going out and shooting up somebody
                    else.</p>
                <p>But my own personal career, then I went to Montreal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get there, you raised something about attitude.
                        Here the war is over, the United States now is exerting itself, really for
                        the first time, particularly in an area such as the Persian Gulf. Although
                        the oil companies might have been there, this had been a British preserve
                        practically. Did you have the feeling, and maybe the others in the
                        consulate, that the United States should have a piece of the action, and
                        that you were in some form of competition, in a way, with the British?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>CHASE: Yes, very definitely we were in competition with the British, but we
                    regarded the British as friends. I personally, at least, didn't want to see the
                    British humbled. I thought myself that a strong Britain is very important for
                    the United States.</p>
                <p>And in the Middle East, we were concerned about dates. Maybe this is not very
                    dynamic now, but it was extremely important that we were importing from Iraq
                    most of the dates that came to the United States. And we were interested in
                    getting Zyr dates and al-Awe dates of a certain quality, a certain degree of
                    sugar content, and purity. The British government was anxious to feed the
                    British Isles, and they were short as hell of food. So we were struggling with
                    how can we get out what we need for the United States in the date market and the
                    British not wanting to lose food.</p>
                <p>We were also distressed that the date industry wasn't really doing anything other
                    than letting the date trees grow. They weren't really pressing forward with
                    improvements of the date, protecting the date from infestation. And we felt that
                    the British were also lackadaisical in promoting the economy of Iraq.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that the British were being too
                        colonial and that they were sitting too hard on the Iraqis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Yes and no. The British were colonial. And there were some of these people
                    out there who were just insufferably colonial.</p>
                <p>The British Club would not let an Iraqi come into the British Club. There was an
                    English woman doctor in town who was married to an Iraqi doctor. The British
                    woman was invited to come into the British Club, but she could not bring her
                    husband to a dance, to a dinner. Also, though, no Americans, at first, were
                    allowed in the British Club except as guests, with several days prior
                    notification. Finally, then, we were invited to come in an join the British Club
                    on an associate status. We then could go to their parties and eat their food.
                    But the British were very colonial, and there was a great deal of argument over
                    protocol.</p>
                <p>The British themselves weren't all that way, there were many of them who were
                    just anxious to move ahead. But the British generally had a very good deal
                    there. They were living so much better than they would be living if they were
                    back in England. They felt the Iraqis were profiting by their reign, but that
                    they were getting a good many of the goodies.</p>
                <p>Iraqi culture was sharply stratified between the very wealthy and the very, very
                    poor. We were somewhat in the tension there, when we would have some of the
                    Iraqis who were against the British coming in and seeking to get American help
                    and American support in one way or another.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we deal with these?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: We didn't give them anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We didn't have any secret agenda of trying to...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: We were trying to promote a more happy sort of democracy. But I can
                    recall, when I went down to Kuwait one time and was talking to one of the
                    leading potentates down there, explaining to him the benefits of democracy and
                    how a democracy worked. He was a very kind intellectual, who was not wanting to
                    displease me but also wanting to say: “Well, look, over here, for so many
                    hundreds of thousands of years we've done things a little bit differently. You
                    have inequities and things that go wrong in your country with your democracy. We
                    may have some of ours, but the poor people are protected, because the wealthy
                    people have family and other ties to them. And we maintain communication.” And
                    he was, to a large extent, right.</p>
                <p>Yes, I think the British were colonial, but not of the Indian type. There was a
                    great deal of social intercourse between the Iraqis and Brits. Some of the
                    British were constantly trying to degrade, demean the Iraqis and point out their
                    faults. And enjoyed very much retreating to the British Club. But yet there were
                    lots of the others who were extremely realistic of the way things were going and
                    anxious to have the Iraqis, the Iranians, and Kuwaitis all develop.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, moving on to your own personal career. Where did you
                        go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: I then went to Montreal. I arrived up there in February, 1948. It was very
                    much a visa mill. That was not for me a happy experience, maybe since I'd come
                    from Iraq, where I'd been the senior officer. When I left, I had been the
                    principal officer. Going to Montreal, they said they had all the work, but they
                    didn't have a desk for me that I could call my desk. It was just confusion.</p>
                <p>And I never quite understood, all the time I was in Montreal, what in the hell
                    were the 7-C documents. Why do they call it 7-C? The idea that there was a law,
                    the Immigration Act of 1924, that detailed how these things would be done and
                    the various regulations that would implement it, I never got any sort of
                    training in that sort of thing. I was just told to look for a birth certificate
                    and see whether or not there was any financial support. It was day in and day
                    out, sitting at one desk or another desk, never knowing quite what was
                    happening.</p>
                <p>And then we were supposed to answer correspondence, people who inquire in: Well,
                    why haven't I gotten my visa yet? I didn't really understand what I was doing.
                    And it seemed that every day things were being done differently.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>They were all very nice to me. I was the only bachelor on the staff. I got to
                    know some of the other officers socially and had a good time—and met my first
                    wife. She came into the office to get a student visa, to go down to Radcliffe to
                    get in what eventually came out as the Harvard Business School. She came in and
                    qualified for a visa. And after the visa was in her hand, I said something about
                    would she accept a dinner invitation if I'd call up sometime. She didn't answer,
                    but she didn't leave. We chatted along about other things, and finally I asked
                    the question a second time. She acknowledged yes, if I'd call up, if she were
                    free, she'd go out to dinner with me.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I notice that you moved rather quickly to Hamburg.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: When I got to Montreal, I just didn't feel I was getting any place. I
                    didn't enjoy it. Somebody came back from Washington and said they were looking
                    for people to go to Germany in the refugee program, to issue visas to refugees.
                    So I called up a fellow in personnel, who I knew was involved in this, and said
                    that I'd be glad to volunteer for the program. And so about three days later a
                    telegram came up, transferring me to Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Hamburg from 1949 to '51. What was the
                        situation in Hamburg?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: I was transferred from Montreal to Stuttgart. I can't tell you why, but
                    anyway I was sent in charge of the refugee visa program. And I was told to do
                    certain things, from Washington, before I left, and from the consul general for
                    refugee work in Frankfurt. The consul general in Stuttgart didn't want me to
                    take instructions from anybody but himself. So we did not get along together.
                    Certainly two bosses is always difficult. Then I called up a fellow I knew in
                    Frankfurt, Jim Suttleff, who was an aide to the consul general on refugee
                    matters, and I said, “Look, things aren't going too well here. Is there anyplace
                    else I could be assigned in Germany?” And he said he'd look into it. And then I
                    was told that the consul general from Hamburg, Edward Gross, needed somebody to
                    help with the visa section up there and would I be interested in that. I said,
                    “Swell. Going up to the British Zone would be interesting.” And they said,
                    “Well, they need somebody up there because all the officers are bachelors.”
                    Gross was a bachelor. And they said, “The inspectors have come through and they
                    said that the office just has to have some married people there, because no one
                    can get to know the local community. So, Will Chase, you're married.” I had
                    gotten married just before I left Montreal—the same lady I gave the visa to. She
                    didn't get to complete her program at MIT. So we were then transferred up to
                    Hamburg and I was in charge of the visa section.[FIRST OF SIDE B MISSING]</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...the opportunity for Germans to emigrate. Prior to that,
                        of course, there was a wartime restriction.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>CHASE: After the war ended, the Germans, I'm sorry I can't recall exactly, but
                    German citizens were not eligible for visas to emigrate to the United States.
                    Maybe if they were parents of minor children, but not normal Germans. So just
                    before I got to Germany, they had determined that yes, they were going to open
                    it up. And there was a big hullabaloo whereby on a certain date the consulates
                    in Germany would accept visa applications. Everybody wanted them, and they had
                    to be sent in there, practically time-dated. We got thousands and thousands of
                    letters, in every one of the offices, for visas, and each one of these was
                    bundled up by the date it had arrived. And when I got to Hamburg, they hadn't
                    even carded, they didn't know who all these people were. We knew that on a
                    certain date we had so many people waiting there. So it was a matter of going
                    through and carding them, knowing who they were, alphabetizing them, and getting
                    up waiting list numbers.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the situation in Hamburg?
                        We're talking about the 1949-51 period. How was Hamburg in those days, and
                        what were our contacts with the Germans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: This was still occupied Germany. Max Brauer had become mayor. He was a
                    German who had lived there, had been chased out by Hitler, gone to the United
                    States and became a labor leader over here. Then he returned to Germany as a US
                    citizen, and the people in Hamburg asked him to stay on to become their mayor.
                    Actually, since Hamburg was an independent state, it was like he had become
                    governor of the state. So he renounced his US citizenship, became a German
                    again, and was immediately elected mayor. But then the British high commissioner
                    sat on top of him, and he controlled, to a large extent, what was going on.</p>
                <p>The streets of Hamburg still showed many of the remains of war. Broken buildings.
                    Some buildings had been cleaned up, some were just in rubble.</p>
                <p>As Americans, we went to the British high commissioner to get housing. They
                    provided us all with housing.</p>
                <p>While we were there, the influence of the occupying powers decreased. We went
                    from the British being the, I can't recall the proper term for it: We were the
                    authority, to where then we got the high commissioner. The Germans were
                    beginning to manage their own internal affairs, but we were kind of riding
                    shotgun to see that they didn't do something they shouldn't do. And that
                    continued on for about three years, I think, before the Germans became
                    independent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else that happened there that you think
                        we should cover before we move on to what must have been quite an
                        interesting assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>CHASE: Hamburg was an interesting assignment. I was head of the visa section,
                    then I became deputy land observer for the United States. The consul general was
                    the land observer. It meant that I worked with the British authorities and how
                    they were doing things.</p>
                <p>In the idea of how our immigration laws were being applied, I became much more
                    concerned with what I thought were the inequities of the old system. Many of
                    these are still on the books today. That is, if a person was a Communist, they
                    were forever and ever forbidden to come to the United States.</p>
                <p>We had a case of a very imminent German woman. She'd been a judge, as I recall,
                    and she applied for a visa to come to the United States. Well, in the course of
                    events, through the British and American intelligence services, we identified
                    that back in 1932-33 she had spoken at some Communist Party meetings in
                    opposition to Hitler.</p>
                <p>We had a son of a bitch of a guy who was a security officer for the consulate,
                    and he said, “Oh, she's a Communist.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Well, look, she denied she was a member of the Communist Party. She
                    admits having attended these meetings, but she was against Hitler. She was
                    working with anybody who would be against Hitler. She was not a member of the
                    Communist Party. She never voted Communist. But the Communists were the only
                    ones who were active, and so she associated with them.”</p>
                <p>I protested that she should get the visa, because since 1945 she'd only done good
                    things insofar as promoting the development of a good Germany. We got
                    representations from Max Brauer's office that she was well thought of. She had
                    never had anything dealing with Communists since 1932. And yet in 1949 we denied
                    her a visa and labeled her a Communist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, boy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: And this bothered the hell out of me. As we now know, we were constantly
                    bringing in Nazis. And yet we were being so strict on these people who had done
                    what they thought they could do to oppose Hitler, oppose fascism. There was a
                    lot of sloppiness about how information was passed about and people being
                    condemned.</p>
                <p>We denied a visa to a young woman who had been convicted of having an abortion.
                    But there had never been a court trial that she admitted that she had the
                    abortion. And she was the wife of an American citizen. She was either a wife or
                    she was engaged to a soldier. She was an awfully nice young girl, who had come
                    though the war. These things bothered the hell out of me.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>And I didn't like the favoritism we gave in the visa process to some of these
                    people who had played footsies with the Nazis. This bothered the hell out of
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think you're capturing a period. I went through that
                        some years later in the mid-'50s when I was in Frankfurt with the refugee
                        relief program. Anything that had any smell of Communist affiliation, as far
                        as our visa business, was absolutely verboten. But we got very, very
                        legalistic and said well, you haven't proved this or that, if somebody was
                        involved with the Nazis. I mean, we had a lot of concentration camp guards
                        who came through, and we couldn't deny them a visa unless we proved they
                        were pushing somebody into the oven. And most of these said, “Well, I was in
                        the SS, but I was a tailor.” The SS certainly had a lot of tailors. And I'm
                        sure you ran across this, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: The majority of Germans who had been in the armed forces never fought on
                    the Western Front, they all fought on the Eastern Front.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were these guys who were keeping us from getting to
                        Berlin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>You mentioned your security officer. One of the things I found disturbing, I
                    don't know if you did, but the almost Neanderthal types who seemed to drift into
                    the security business, and who were trying to settle matters that needed an
                    extreme political sophistication to understand what was going on in Europe
                    during the '30s and Forties. And yet we had men who seemed to have come right
                    off the police beat in Boston or something. Did you find this?</p>
                <p>CHASE: Yes, the people who were interested in pursuing this sort of thing were
                    almost invariably not particularly well-educated. They weren't, I think,
                    sophisticated. Not that I was necessarily sophisticated, but at least I was
                    aware of a variety of currents, and that you can't look at a person one way and
                    determine forever and ever what they're going to be in the future. There was
                    this overwhelming number of security people, all sorts of checks being made, and
                    the records weren't being well-handled. We also never told a person what the
                    allegation against them was. We could maybe hint around about it, and if the
                    person was smart, they would know how to approach it. But at the beginning, they
                    didn't really know what to say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, moving to a different subject, but almost the
                        equivalent to the one that was going on in Basra. You were deputy land
                        observer and you were watching the British as they were beginning to
                        relinquish hold. What was your impression, as an American at that time, of
                        the British occupation in that part of Germany? How did they feel about the
                        Germans? I mean, was there a difference between how the Americans felt and
                        the Germans felt, would you say, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>CHASE: Yes, there was a difference. To an extent, the British were suffering
                    terrible things in England. They had an economy that was in shambles, and they
                    were hoping to get things out of Germany to make their own economy function. On
                    the other hand, the Americans were pouring all sorts of things in to build up
                    the economy of Germany so that they could be a strong ally against the Soviet
                    menace. The British were being pushed around by us, and the Germans were already
                    acquiring considerable strength. They were blocking the British efforts to do
                    the things that the British wanted done. The British weren't for much
                    development of Germany because they were seeing the Germans as being
                    competitors. We were all for development of Germany. We had the resources and
                    the British didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Germany in 1951, and then what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Oh, I might mention, going clear back. I told you when I came into the
                    Foreign Service I was appointed as a vice consul auxiliary. When I was in Basra,
                    they offered written examinations—the first time for written examinations for
                    FSOs. I said that I wanted to take the examination. The exam was to be given on
                    a certain date in Basra—the same date throughout the whole world. Well, I waited
                    for the examination papers to arrive, and waited for them to arrive, and waited
                    for them to arrive, and they weren't there. We finally sent a telegram: Where
                    are the exams? And they cabled back: The exams had been mailed at a certain time
                    and hoped that they'd get there. Well, the day before the exam had to be taken,
                    a sea-mail bag arrived, and it contained on the bottom a big, brown envelope
                    which was the examination. So the next morning I took the exam. And Lester
                    Sutton sent in a telegram to say that I'd taken the examination, and that he had
                    monitored it, and that the papers would be sent back. Well, then we got a reply,
                    and apparently they were mixed up. There were lots and lots of people at posts
                    all over the world who never got the exams. They were all sent out by sea-mail
                    and mine got there. The department then was concerned about: Was there some
                    hanky-panky? Well, we had to tell the name of the ship that it came on and the
                    name of the bag, and that it had gotten to Basra, legally, the day before the
                    exam had to be administered. So I got my exam, and I passed—barely.</p>
                <p>Then, some months later, they had an oral examination panel that came to Europe
                    to administer the oral exam. I had to hitchhike my way up to Paris to take the
                    examination. Well, I was lucky in this, in a sense. When I got into the board,
                    they knew I had hitchhiked up, and apparently this pleased the board very much.
                    The clerk of the board told me later on: “Oh, you passed before you ever got
                    into the room.”</p>

                <p>CHASE: Yes, I was appointed under the Rogers Act. I think it was two weeks before
                    the Foreign Service Act of 1946 came in.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Rogers Act was the early one of 1924.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: So then my next post after Hamburg was Haifa, Israel. I had been
                    transferred to Port Said to be principal officer there. I wrote a letter to the
                    fellow in Port Said and said that I was going to replace him. And apparently
                    this guy took the position that he didn't want to leave Port Said, and he
                    protested and screamed. So, since he refused to leave, the Department then
                    decided to find me another place to go and they offered me Haifa, and I said
                    yes.</p>
                <p>I was principal officer there. It handled the immigrant visa work for all of
                    Israel. It's a port city, again. I had a staff of about four or five officers
                    and about eighteen trained locals.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation, from your point of view,
                        during this period, '51 to '55?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Israel became an independent country in '48, and it was in the throes of
                    trying to find its way in the world when I arrived in '51. There were large
                    numbers of immigrants coming from Eastern Europe and from Europe in general. The
                    country had very little in the way of resources. They were still trying to find
                    their way around in how to organize themselves.</p>
                <p>The Mapai Party was then the party. It is now the Labor Party of Peres, but it
                    was a little bit different mix. Mapai, and its main economic instrument,
                    Histadrut, ruled all things happening in Israel. There was this emotional zeal
                    of: We're building a Jewish State.</p>
                <p>There was a good bit of feeling against the Arabs. The Arabs had been dealt with
                    pretty miserably. Sometimes you could say security was a legitimate excuse, but
                    lots of it was just mendacious.</p>
                <p>I was back in Israel, in 1980, I think it was, the last time, and meeting my old
                    friends, so many of them, who had all been supporters of Mapai in the old days,
                    have now become right-wingers, supporting Likud, Begin, Shamir, and that crowd.
                    And there is a much tighter animosity toward the Arabs. The Israelis in general,
                    over this continuum, I think have done wonderful things in developing a
                    country—in every way other than learning how to get along with their Arab
                    neighbors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, at the time, did you do any reporting, or was
                        this pretty much left to the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: No, we did a lot of reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about on the Arab-Israeli relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>CHASE: I was the main officer for reporting on Arab affairs in Israel. I would go
                    up to the Arab communities and talk with them about their problems, trying to
                    find out what was happening.</p>
                <p>I recall, in the course of events, I wrote a report which in essence was
                    criticizing the Greek Orthodox Church. Almost immediately, the Greek consul
                    general from Jerusalem called me up and said, Oh, would I have lunch with him?
                    He obviously had learned what I had said in my report, and he was down there to
                    try and protect his flock, in showing me how much they all cooperated and worked
                    together and were doing constructive things.</p>
                <p>The Jewish Israelis were sometimes concerned about my seeing as many Arabs as I
                    saw. They were distrustful of the Arabs and kind of wondering what was I
                    doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Things, of course, have changed so much, but at that time,
                        as far as American relations with Israel were concerned, were you getting
                        any sort of feedback from the embassy or from the desk or something, saying:
                        Cool it, don't get too involved with reporting on the Arabs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: No, I was being encouraged to do it. I mean, this was in my job
                    description. This was one of the reasons I was down there. I was petroleum
                    reporting officer for all of Israel, and I was to maintain contact with the Arab
                    community and report on how they were feeling. I also reported on what was going
                    on in Haifa. The desk officer at the time said that, as for learning what the
                    atmosphere was on the streets of Israel, he found my letters more informative
                    than the embassy's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Monnett B. Davis. He was a South American ambassador. He died in Israel
                    December 26, 1953. After his death, Francis Russell was charg� for about a year
                    or a year and half, and then the next ambassador was Lawson, who came out of
                    Greece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were sort of bounced around and had no particular
                        designation. Did you have any feel for what was the embassy attitude and the
                        Foreign Service attitude, within the desk, the embassy, and your post,
                        towards Israel at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Oh, I went down to the embassy staff meetings. At least once a month I was
                    down in Tel Aviv, meeting the ambassador, the charg�, the DCM, and the other
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you describe it as saying that we were looking upon
                        developments in Israel enthusiastically, or objectively, or somewhat
                        removed, or how, within that context?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: At that time, we were not nearly as committed to Israel as we are today.
                    We were on the way to. Everyone knew that there would have been no Israel except
                    for the United States' support in 1948, and that Israel was looking to us for
                    financial and economic support.</p>
                <p>Just as I was arriving, I think it was, our first real AID mission was
                    established. I can't remember the name of the fellow, but he came in with
                    something like $30 billion to be spent over three years. It was one of these
                    first large grants of money to help the Israeli economic infrastructure.</p>
                <p>I think there were a number of things that were going along in relation to Israel
                    that I, as consul in Haifa, was not privy to. But I was very much privy to the
                    thrust of our program that Israel shall succeed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any reflections, either through
                        communications or contacts with the Foreign Service establishment that was
                        in the Arab posts around there, about developments there, saying what the
                        hell, I mean, you know, this isn't going to be very good for us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Yes, I talked to Beirut frequently. I went over to Amman. I had met Roy
                    Atherton in Stuttgart, and then he arrived in Damascus about that time and I saw
                    him over there.</p>
                <p>There was quite a lot of tension in the Foreign Service per se, as to whether the
                    United States was being too deeply committed to the Israeli side. Were we
                    conscious of what it was costing us among the Arabs?</p>
                <p>I would respond to that sort of argument along the lines that whether Israel
                    should or should not have been created was no longer the question. Israel was
                    there, and the thing that we had to do was try to make Israel as successful as
                    we could, to provide safety, a home for the Jewish population. But we also to
                    had to promote Israel's interests among the Arab States, to develop a modus
                    vivendi. And so, in my reporting on the Arabs, it was: What are the things that
                    Israel is doing vis-�-vis the Arabs that are unnecessarily causing animosities
                    and disputes and problems, that in the long run, which I think until today, are
                    hampering Israel's real security and safety.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, how about dealing with Israeli authorities? Did
                        you find this quite different from, say, dealing with what was developing in
                        Germany or in Iraq or something? I mean, how did you find the people you
                        dealt with in Haifa?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>CHASE: There are lots of differences in each one of these countries of how they
                    view problems and what is their method of operation. But as for me, as an
                    American Foreign Service officer, I constantly worked on the principle of trying
                    to be sympathetic to their problems, and saying I want to be able to tell
                    Washington as accurately as possible how they see things and what are they
                    trying to do. You use different words, you use a little different manner when
                    working one group or the other, but the Israelis were very cordial to me, very
                    open.</p>
                <p>I might go back to Basra, Iraq, one incident that I found very amusing, on final
                    reflection. As economic officer, I was supposed to be reporting on these
                    companies that were doing business, and filling out WTDRs, World Trade Directory
                    reports.</p>
                <p>I was asked to get the report on one company, and so I went around and talked to
                    a banker, and said, “What will you tell me about this company?” I got back a
                    little, sterile sort of bank statement.</p>
                <p>I asked around, and I drove up and saw where their offices were. I knew the
                    fellow socially, and I met him. A week or so after I got the request, I finally
                    got to the point where I thought, well, I'll just have to go and talk to this
                    guy. I didn't really know what to say, and I talked to Lester Sutton to find out
                    what I should do. I didn't get much guidance.</p>
                <p>Finally, I got into the man's office, and he had to leave. So I was kind of
                    looking around over his desk: Where are the letters from? And what are the
                    stamps? I thought, “How is this going to happen?”</p>
                <p>So I sat around the office, and the fellow came back, and we chatted about
                    various things. I must have gotten some message over to him, because finally he
                    suddenly discovered that I wanted to know what his company was doing. And I had
                    not told him that at all.</p>
                <p>Once he realized that I was interested in his company, my gosh, books came off
                    the desk, off the shelves, everything. He was showing me this contract, that
                    contract. And I then finally discovered that there's nothing that a businessman
                    wants to do more than talk about his own business.</p>
                <p>And this sort of thing, of how does one get information, I learned from this one
                    incident that frequently you have to tell the person: Look, I'm in there to talk
                    to you because I want to know what you're doing.</p>
                <p>And so, when I was in Israel, going in to talk to people about the business, I
                    asked them, “Where do you get your supplies? Where do you sell your things?”</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>I can tell you all some interesting tales about the fine oils and essence
                    industry. At that time, one of the major companies in the world was located in
                    Israel. And I said, “Well, why are you here?”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Freight costs are nothing. It's all knowledge of how the things go
                    together, and it's skill.” And he said, “So an American company was making
                    hickory smoked hams, and hickory wood was becoming expensive, so he was trying
                    to find an essence that would give his hams the same flavor. So he sent me over
                    a variety of his hams and said, 'Can you make an essence that will produce
                    this?'” All of his competitors in the United States were running into the same
                    problem, and he wanted to get a source that none of the other people would know
                    about, so he thought: “Israel! They don't know about hams over there.”</p>
                <p>Well, they know about hams. And this friend of mine, who happened to be a
                    Sephardic Jew from the Netherlands, a very erudite guy, figured out how to make
                    this essence, so this was one of his customers. And he said, “I can compete with
                    anybody, because the basic raw materials come from worldwide, the market is
                    worldwide.”</p>
                <p>But then, going in and talking to, say, the military authorities who were ruling
                    the Arab quarters of Israel, just go in and ask them: “Why did you seize
                    somebody's land? Why don't you give him back his buses?” And they very rarely
                    ever came and said, “Well, really, that's not an appropriate question to
                    ask.”</p>
                <p>I did, though, find out an Israeli that I happened to meet and got to know. He
                    was married to an American girl. And he asked me to take a drive with him one
                    day. And in the course of the drive, he said, “Did you get a letter from
                    Congressman Bolton?” (Frances Bolton from Cleveland.) “What is she writing you?
                    Why did she write you?” And it turned out that he knew all about the letter.
                    Then he said, “Israeli Intelligence have asked me to form a friendship with you
                    and find out what you're doing.”</p>
                <p>I then had a local employee, a very smart Romanian Jew who was doing a certain
                    amount of economic and political work for me. And when he left, he said, “Look,
                    if my replacement doesn't tell you that he has been approached by Israeli
                    Intelligence in a matter of a few months, be suspicious of him.” This fellow
                    came to the United States and graduated from some New York City school. He broke
                    all records with complete A's.</p>
                <p>Israeli Intelligence, I was aware, due to these various things, were interested
                    not just in what I was doing, but I knew they were certainly indeed looking into
                    what all of our US government people were doing. And so Pollard was approached
                    eventually.</p>

                <p>CHASE: Certain ones of these things were stock. I remember the American community
                    asked me to come to a meeting and discuss this issue of why did they lose their
                    citizenship if they did certain things. I was using a variety of analogies to
                    try and say that you can't serve two gods at the same time. If you are an
                    American citizen, wonderful. If you give your allegiance over to Israel, that's
                    wonderful. But don't try and do two at the same time. All our laws are to
                    prevent people from being put in a position where they'll have a conflict of
                    interest.</p>
                <p>Then we ran into a situation of taking away citizenship from people who had voted
                    in Israeli elections. The people had an identity card, and so when they came in
                    to get their passport renewed, we said, “Well, where's your identity card?” So
                    we'd look in the identity card to see if there was a voting stamp there. And
                    that's how the Israelis controlled who voted, by putting a stamp in their
                    identity card.</p>
                <p>Well, a number of these people said, “I didn't vote! I didn't vote! I didn't
                    vote!” Here it was in their card.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>As this went along, we then discovered that, particularly in some of the people
                    we'd seen, the kibbutz would hold everybody's identity card, and as the person
                    would come in to vote, they'd give them the identity card so they could go to
                    the next room and vote. However, as the end of the day was approaching, and they
                    had a number of ID cards that hadn't been voted, they would take them over and
                    vote them. And so some of these Americans were losing their citizenship
                    improperly.</p>
                <p>We had a woman by the name of Sylvia Bernstein, a very wonderful lady. Her father
                    was a prominent federal judge up in Philadelphia. Sylvia lived in a kibbutz, and
                    she did not vote, she said, but her ID card said she had. We took away her
                    citizenship. She came to me and said, “Look, we are friends. I want to just tell
                    you, you have done a terrible misdeed.” (I hadn't done it, my predecessor did
                    it. But I would have done it.) And she said, “I did not vote.” And she began to
                    tell me of how this thing was going on in the kibbutz. We then went through, oh,
                    quite a number of months of talking to various people, and finally we presented
                    a report to the Department of State that we believed Sylvia Bernstein was
                    telling the truth when she said she had not voted. And so, on this occasion, the
                    citizenship was restored.</p>
                <p>Then I had another friend who was a draft evader.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: American draft evader or Israeli?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: American draft evader. I can remember the day he came into the office. I
                    had called him in and said I wanted to see his passport. So he gave me his
                    passport and I threw it on my desk and I said, “I have to tell you that you're
                    no longer a US citizen.” He got his citizenship back later on, of course,
                    through these court proceedings. He was one of these interesting guys, but on
                    this question of dual nationality, like a number of these other Americans, he
                    wanted to be a citizen of both countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that the American citizenship was
                        something (which I've run across in other countries) that they wanted to
                        keep in their hip pocket in case things got bad, but their real commitment
                        was to the state they were in? I found this true in Greece, for
                        example.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Some would be perfectly comfortable stating it that blatantly. The
                    majority of them would say: “We are true Americans, and we believe that there is
                    no possibility of a conflict of interest between Israel and the United States.”
                    They wanted to participate in the local activities. They would say, “Look, our
                    children go to the schools. We are being affected in various ways, and we think
                    we should be allowed to do this.”</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>You see, it wasn't against the law. And I, at least, felt convinced that the law
                    was correct. I can recall I was up in Canada when the whole thing was declared
                    unconstitutional. I thought, “My God, those Supreme Court people are jerks.” And
                    then I got, as quickly as I could, a copy of the whole decision. I began reading
                    through, and I came to the conclusion, “My gosh, they're absolutely right. The
                    Constitution doesn't give the legislative power to take away citizenship.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've now reached the point where we can move from Haifa
                        to your next position, which was in Ankara. I have you being there from 1955
                        to '59. Does this make you a Middle East hand or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: I have a lot of affection for the Middle East, but I never became a
                    linguist. I think I would have continued further in the Middle East except that
                    one of my children had school problems and I felt it was best that we stick to
                    places where I could get better schooling, or at least hopefully better schools.
                    Like a lot of these things, your career doesn't always evolve quite the way
                    you'd think you would like it, but it turned out well.</p>
                <p>I liked Ankara. When I first got there, I arrived on, I think it was the 4th of
                    July, and Webb Balance, the administrative officer, came down to the hotel and
                    said, “Well, how do you like going down to Izmir?” This took me by surprise. I
                    suddenly found out that the consul down in Izmir was leaving, and the new one
                    wasn't going to come for quite some time, and that he wanted me to be down there
                    to run the office. So I went on down and I had a good time in Izmir, I enjoyed
                    it.</p>
                <p>It was interesting to me that, when I had been living in Israel, Cyprus was a
                    place that we used to visit from time to time, and the problem with EOKA, the
                    Greek community of Cyprus that wanted to join Greece. First of all, the British
                    were resisting, and then it became the Turks who were resisting, since a very
                    sizable portion of the population is Turk. I became aware of these tensions over
                    in Cyprus, from visits when I was in Israel, and when I was en route from Haifa
                    to Ankara, I had stopped off there while the boat had stopped there, and all
                    these notices about EOKA dangers.</p>
                <p>Well, I ended up and went down to Izmir. My first job in Ankara, I'd been sent
                    there to be one of the political officers. The Izmir trade fair was coming up.
                    That is a big international trade fair, and there was going to be an American
                    building there for us to show off our wares. We wanted to know what was
                    happening there, we also wanted to see a great deal what the Soviets were doing,
                    what were the Eastern Europeans doing.</p>
                <p>I'd been intrigued with Turkey for quite some time, even going back to Basra
                    days. I can recall a John Van Ness, who was a missionary out there, and his
                    daughter then married Bill Brewer, who was in the Foreign Service and became
                    Ambassador Brewer. And John Van Ness was saying, “The Palestine situation, what
                    we need are a few Turks to take care of that.”</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>And Turks do have, I think rather successfully, a managerial sense. They know
                    what it is to run things. You can argue whether it's done well or not, but being
                    an administrator, be it a governmental administrator or a business
                    administrator, being an administrator or director is an admired profession in
                    Turkey. The government pays fairly low salaries, and families would subsidize
                    one of their members if they would go into the government. So they're used to
                    it.</p>
                <p>Well, in Izmir, it is definitely Middle Eastern, with a heavy overlay of
                    remembrances of things Greek.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It used to be Smyrna.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: I know that the Greek consuls general would call it somehow Smyrna, but
                    not I.</p>
                <p>Speaking of a colonial atmosphere, this was a Levantine sort of an atmosphere:
                    tobacco growers, agriculturalists, a foreign community of missionaries, business
                    people, educators who had been living there, some of them for generations. They
                    weren't Turks, they were French, they were British, they were what have you; it
                    was a colorful sort of an environment.</p>
                <p>They came up to celebrating the occupation of Smyrna, the beginning of Izmir, and
                    I was the only foreign consul who went down for these celebrations of the
                    Turkish National Day. The people invited me, but it was not a formal sort of a
                    thing, and I found out that the foreign consular people were aloof to it. It
                    wasn't that they weren't welcome, they just didn't become involved. I went down,
                    and the Turks very much noticed that an American was there. And they appreciated
                    it.</p>
                <p>The commanding general took me off and said, “You notice that.” Down at the dock
                    where the main formalities were taking place, the ships were in the
                    Mediterranean moorings, with the stern to the dock. And here, right there in
                    front of the reviewing stand, was a Greek ship with a Greek flag. And the
                    general said, “Past things are past.” Nothing was said against Greeks, it was
                    all completely neutral. This was a day that we had occupied Izmir—not occupied
                    it from whom—but occupied it. And I was quite intrigued with the way that they
                    were phrasing it and trying to say we are in NATO with Greece and Britain.</p>
                <p>However, a few days later I was down at this big international fair. I'd been in
                    one exhibit and when I came out of it I noticed there was some fire and a
                    certain excitement around. All of a sudden I realized that it was the Greek
                    pavilion that had been torched. This was relating very much to the Cyprus issue.
                    The Turks had been fairly quiet, but, for reasons that are still under debate,
                    anti-Greek riots took place in Istanbul, and in Izmir they torched the Greek
                    pavilion.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>I got into my car with my wife and we started driving down to the Greek consul
                    general's home, to warn him and tell him what was happening. We got there, and
                    as we came up, the first head people of the mob had outrun our car. They had
                    gotten there first and they had torched the house. The Greek consul general, his
                    wife, and a child were there, but they were able to escape through the back
                    door. Nobody was injured. But about three o'clock in the morning, I was wakened
                    by the Greek consul general calling me and saying he wanted to come and seek
                    asylum at the American Consulate. So we gave him asylum. His wife and child, oh,
                    everything they had had been destroyed; it was quite a sad event.</p>
                <p>For the next four and a half years that I was in Turkey, my occupation was Cyprus
                    and the Greek-Turkish...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get involved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: I was a political officer in the embassy. Now that was the thing I was
                    working on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is very interesting because we have had quite a few
                        interviews with people who, mostly later on, but who were involved, but
                        almost always from the Cypriot point of view.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Toby Belcher among others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, well, I mean they just happened to be there on this.
                        Every time you talk about Cyprus, you have to talk about a specific time,
                        but really it doesn't change a bit, I guess, the feelings. This was '55 to
                        '59, what was, let's say, the official Turkish attitude at that time, as
                        opposed to maybe the street attitude, towards Greece and Cyprus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: I think, in talking to the Turks I met when I was on Cyprus: shopkeepers,
                    fellows with me out sailing, Turks, and the Greeks, it's like a number of these
                    areas where you have a minority, that if a Turk went in to get a job on Cyprus
                    in a bank, he would maybe be hired to be the janitor, but he would never dream
                    of becoming a clerk. He hit an economic ceiling that he couldn't penetrate. And,
                    seeing what was happening to the Arabs in Israel, again you hit your ceiling,
                    you become very, very much constrained.</p>
                <p>The Turks would tell me on Cyprus about, “Look, if there's an earthquake over
                    there in Turkey, the spring that I get my water from here in Cyprus turns
                    muddy.” So there are connections.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>But when I arrived in Turkey, the first few weeks I was there, I was aware that
                    people were very conscious of things Greek, and that some of this was completely
                    unrelated to the Cyprus issue. There is enough other history of the Turks and
                    the Greeks having problems.</p>
                <p>I was asked to go down to Istanbul and talk to the various members of the
                    community. The ambassador didn't like what the consul general in Istanbul was
                    sending in, but he liked the things I was reporting, so he asked me to go and
                    look around in Istanbul—which the consul general in Istanbul didn't particularly
                    appreciate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The ambassador was Fletcher Warren at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: No, that was Avra Warren.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Istanbul man sending in that the Ankara man
                        didn't care for from the consul general in Istanbul? Do you know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Oh, it was in part this issue of how deep-seated, how much animosity is
                    there between the Turks and the Greeks; how much was this a definite
                    governmental-directed, government-managed riot that took place; how much was it
                    that maybe the government encouraged or suggested that it be done, and then the
                    dam of self-control was removed and the natural desire for anger at the Greeks
                    took over. And so, as I believe, the ambassador was disturbed that the Istanbul
                    consul general was sending in too much: This is a government-directed, -run,
                    -managed plot. And he wanted to find out a little bit more of comments from
                    people who would say that this is a thing that the Turkish people are deeply
                    concerned about. And from my reporting in Izmir, he had liked the things I was
                    sending in from there. So when I was returned to Ankara and took up my assigned
                    position as political officer, he then asked me to look into this thing and see
                    what I could find out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After you looked into this, how did you see the official
                        Turkish attitude towards the Cyprus problem and Greeks? Again, we're talking
                        about the '50s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: At that time, the Turkish government began to feel that Greece was trying
                    to put a stranglehold around them: taking up all the Greek islands in the Aegean
                    Sea, going through Rhodes and Cyprus, that this would be encircling them. There
                    are a whole lot of other things that kind of filtered into this and fed it along
                    the way. But at the time, in '55 when I arrived in Turkey, the Turks were not
                    particularly concerned about Cyprus, in that they were convinced that the
                    British were going to stay on forever.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did the British leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Just when I left, in '59. It was the Geneva Accord, when Menderes and (I
                    can't think of the name of the fellow in Greece) finally met and signed an
                    accord which established the dual Greek-Turkish government of Cyprus.</p>
                <p>But at the same time that I was arriving, the British had given signs that they
                    were going to pull out and turn the island over. So from '55 to '59, the Turks
                    were adamant that Britain will not leave Cyprus under conditions which will
                    allow Cyprus to be joined to Greece. At the beginning (and to an extent I still
                    think there is a lot to it), the Turks didn't have any really latent, deep anger
                    with Greece. But they did react, and I think it was popular, they reacted,
                    saying that Greece is fine, it's over there, but they will not come and dominate
                    us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's funny. I served, as you know, some years later in
                        Greece, and I had the feeling in Greece that the Greeks used the Turks as
                        the bogeyman all the time. Anything that happened, they were concentrated on
                        Turkey. Whereas the Turks, from my distant observation, really weren't that
                        interested in the Greeks per se. I mean, they were more concerned about the
                        Soviets and others, and that the Greeks were an annoyance but not a major
                        preoccupation—unless they started messing around in Cyprus with the minority
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: I would agree with that. The Turks didn't have an obsession with things
                    Greek. Generally, they couldn't care less about what the Greeks were doing. They
                    felt rather superior to the Greeks. They were very much concerned about the
                    Soviets. They were concerned about the Kurds in eastern Turkey. They were
                    concerned about Syria and Iraq and Iran, their neighbors there. They share water
                    and population and transportation problems. At one time, we had tried very much
                    to get the Turks to become involved with the Arab-Israeli thing. The Turks
                    weren't particularly willing to be brought into that squabble.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were there, this was the Menderes government.
                        What was your observation of the role of the Turkish military at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Whenever you start talking about Turkey, modern Turkey, I think that it's
                    important to start out almost with a little summary of Ataturk and his six
                    principles.</p>
                <p>Ataturk instilled in the Turks a terrific sense of nationalism and
                    self-confidence, an attitude on the relationship of people to the government,
                    government to the people, and the importance of democracy. Even though Ataturk
                    was a dictator, he was devoted to the concept of real democracy.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>And the spirit of democracy was such that the military have never felt that they
                    can do anything other than support Ataturk and his devotion to democracy. The
                    military was in the background, solely as a defense of the homeland, not for
                    interfering with politics. And they got, I think, reluctantly dragged into the
                    political fray with the Menderes government and then several other subsequent
                    governments not being able to govern properly. And so the military took on the
                    mantle of governmental rule most reluctantly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling in your dealings at that time
                        that the civilian government was sort of taking a more pragmatic stand on
                        the Cyprus issue, and that at least the leaders of the military really
                        wanted to have at the Greeks, at least on Cyprus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: The military didn't want to become involved with Cyprus. They looked at
                    Cyprus as being something that wasn't their bag, because they were concerned
                    with the Soviets and Eastern Europe, and somewhat with the Arab frontier, but
                    that was more of a peacekeeping thing. See, at that time the Baghdad Pact was
                    alive, and the Turks were very much key supporters of the Baghdad Pact. These
                    were the areas that they were thinking about, and Greece wasn't a threat to
                    them. In a military thing, they'd see Cyprus as something that was going to be
                    handled through negotiation and through diplomacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about in our embassy? You have the Cyprus thing, and
                        these negotiations were going on. Were we playing any role, from your
                        vantage point, during the gradual breaking away by the British from
                        responsibility in Cyprus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Oh, we played a very active role in the Cyprus dispute. We didn't ever
                    become a party at the negotiating table, but we were constantly in the
                    background, arguing with the Brits, the Greeks, and the Turks about let's keep
                    this thing as a diplomatic tug of war, not a military tug of war. In fact, none
                    of us even really thought of that as being a realistic concern. This did not
                    come out, really, in the conversations, about the threat of a military
                    intervention.</p>
                <p>But we were constantly trying to assess what were the minimum conditions that the
                    Turks would accept, what were the minimum conditions that the Brits would
                    accept, and what were the minimum that the Greeks would accept. I think that we
                    did fairly early come out with the thought that Cyprus should not become a part
                    of Greece, enosis should not be fomented.</p>
                <p>We toyed with trying to push the British to continue on to rule there. But the
                    British were broke and they were getting their soldiers killed, so they thought
                    they had to pull out.</p>
                <p>We talked to Makarios, in trying to get Makarios to be rational. Maybe coming
                    from the Turkish background, I think Makarios was a dirty old scoundrel. Toby
                    Belcher, I know, liked him. I think Toby also realized...</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Toby Belcher was our ambassador...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: He was our consul general. We of course had in Cyprus at that time some
                    very major installations: USIA, the CIA, and our radio transmitters. So we had
                    an interest, and to a large extent I think it's still there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Actually, it was a place where a lot of our interests
                        intertwined. We had bases we considered very important at that period in
                        Greece, in Turkey, and in Cyprus. So there was no feeling that we should
                        just duck it and let everybody else play a hand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: No, no, we were an active participant even though we shied away from
                    acknowledging that we were a part of the negotiation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the reaction in the embassy and with yourself to
                        the agreement that was signed in Geneva, the Geneva Accords on Cyprus in
                        '59?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: [A sigh of relief] At last. We knew it was tricky and it might not
                    succeed, but we were just so relieved that we thought “thank goodness”. I
                    arrived in Turkey with the almost breakdown of Greek-Turkish relations, and when
                    I left, here the two governments had signed an accord. It was the answer to the
                    maiden's prayer. With good will, we had a feeling that this is a viable
                    solution. That if the Greeks and the Turks on the island would really try to
                    make this succeed, it could succeed. That each side's basic interests were
                    protected. There was enough opportunity for them to make a successful
                    marriage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there, what was the embassy and sort of
                        from your vantage point the view of the “Soviet menace” as far as Turkey was
                        concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Did we think there was a true Soviet menace?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: I'd say absolutely yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what regard? What was our nightmare that would happen?
                        How would the Soviets do something in Turkey? Invasion? Subversion?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>CHASE: There are a couple of things to be considered. One, we had extensive
                    military capability in the country. We had an extensive espionage network.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not espionage, but a listening post.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Not just listening posts. The U-2s came out. But then there are a couple
                    of other little incidents that you may recall. We were flying military aircraft
                    along that Soviet border to pick up what the Soviets were doing towards
                    scrambling their planes and what sorts of radio signals that they were doing. So
                    that our planes were going along that border.</p>
                <p>There's a story that I, I know I'm right, but I talked to a friend of mine who
                    was there at the time and he doesn't remember it the way I remember it. And I
                    know I'm right. One of our planes that we knew was doing this, and the Soviets
                    were protesting all the time, we flew a plane out there, and the dirty old
                    Soviets shot the damn thing down. It had actually penetrated into Soviet
                    airspace and it crashed in Soviet airspace. We denounced the Soviets for their
                    taking hostile action at a friendly aircraft, but we all knew what was
                    happening. We then demanded that the bodies of the airmen be returned. As I
                    remember it, we never got back all the bodies, and there was suspicion that
                    maybe some of these people survived the crash and were prisoners of war over
                    there. This friend of mine, Bill Helsitz, went there to the border and asked
                    about the..., they were talking to the Soviets, our military people did the
                    talking, Bill just watched, and saying, “Well, where are the other bodies?” And
                    the Soviets said, “These are all.” I don't know and I've not found anybody else
                    able to go back and clarify this, whether I even remember this and whether even
                    I made a mistake and I remember it incorrectly, but the idea was that they'd
                    shot down one of our planes, and the plane had gotten into Soviet space because
                    those dirty old Ruskies fiddling with the navigational stuff, so that as our
                    planes flew in, they jostled those things around so our plane didn't realize
                    precisely where he was and he strayed over into the other side. Now there's that
                    incident. And the Turks were very much concerned about that.</p>
                <p>Now the other thing was, in 1956, I think it was, all of a sudden we were
                    becoming very much interested in the study of clouds, and we started putting up
                    big balloons in the air. And we were flying them so they were drifting across
                    the Soviet Union. What we had was all sorts of camera and this stuff, hoping
                    that the balloons would carry way over into the Philippines or China or
                    someplace where we could recover them. And the Soviets objected to this
                    strenuously—these crazy guys. These balloons were being floated from Turkey, and
                    we got a couple of them brought back. They never got across the border, and we
                    picked them up and brought them in and put them in the parking lot back of the
                    embassy. And so here were these damn things laying out there. And you could walk
                    over and see the lenses that they had. These were very definitely spy jobs. What
                    made us have trouble with the Turks was that all of a sudden, out of Washington,
                    we apologized to the Russians and we said we wouldn't do it any more—and we
                    didn't tell the Turks until afterwards.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>We were rather high-handed with the Turkish military. And a number of our officer
                    were, I think, rather superciliously arrogant with them. But the Turks were
                    definitely concerned by what the Soviets would do if we weren't there. As long
                    as we were there, they were ready to thumb their noses at the Russians. The idea
                    that there could be an atomic war, the Turkish people we talked with in the
                    Foreign Office said, “Well, we Turks have fought the Russians, what is it, a
                    hundred times over the so many centuries.” They had a long history of major
                    wars. And they said, “Well, we lose some, we win some, but we will not let the
                    Soviets push us around.” And atomic weapons? “We all have to die sometime.” They
                    were tough.</p>
                <p>And Joseph Alsop, the columnist, came out there because there was a big
                    hullabaloo over the threat of atomic war. And the Turks were being put upon by
                    the Soviets with threats. Joe Alsop came in and he talked with us, and he was
                    just so distressed. And he came to Ankara, which was supposed to be the center
                    of the hurricane, and everything was peaceful. The Turks said, “The Russians are
                    making a fuss. They've made fusses before. We are here, and we will not move.”
                    And Joseph Alsop was quite irritated at the Turks because he wanted them to be
                    more excited.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He wanted a story. There were three events that happened
                        while you were there. Two in 1956: the Hungarian uprising and the Suez Canal
                        attack on Egypt by Israel, France, and Britain. How did Turkey react to

                <p>CHASE: Yes, '58, that was later. But the invasion of the Suez Canal, I was in
                    Ankara at that time. The Turks weren't too much concerned. Our embassy was more
                    concerned than anything else. The Turks were somewhat disdainful towards the
                    Arabs, and they did not like Nasser. They very much disliked Nasser. Remember
                    when Nasser formed a union with...</p>

                <p>CHASE: Yes, with Syria. I can remember there was a Turkoman at the Foreign
                    Office. With glee he said, “You know, Nasser shouldn't have ever made that visit
                    to Damascus. Because the Syrians looked at Nasser, when they saw him in the
                    flesh, and said, “My God, we've allowed ourselves to be ruled by a nigger.” They
                    didn't like Nasser from the beginning, and anything that could cut Nasser down
                    was in their interests.</p>

                        things almost: July 14, the overthrow of the Iraqi ruler, Hassan, and the
                        end of the Baghdad Pact in effect, or at least Iraq and the Baghdad Pact.
                        And also, almost concurrently, was our invasion, or whatever you want to
                        call it, of Lebanon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: The Turks were badly shook up by the collapse of the Iraqi government.
                    They didn't have any deep affections for the Iraqis, but at least they felt that
                    they gave them a security, and it also gave them a greater degree of eminence,
                    because they were members of this viable Baghdad Pact. And they were getting a
                    number of goodies from the United States. You talk about the military, they were
                    always interested in getting better planes, better ships, better technological
                    equipment from the United States. They knew where their bread and butter was
                    coming from. And with the Baghdad Pact collapse, this made them feel uneasy. For
                    one reason: What does this mean in Iran? They were aware that the forces that
                    overthrew King Faisal were also operating in Iran. They didn't want to have Arab
                    nationalism, they didn't want to have a turbulent neighbor. They were enough
                    annoyed with what was going on in Syria, they didn't want to have also Iraq as a
                    problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And how about our going into Lebanon?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: They were very much concerned with Lebanon, the feeling that this was one
                    of those points of igniting further troubles in the Middle East. Chamoun was one
                    that they felt deserved and needed support, and they had advised us to find ways
                    to give Chamoun support. When the final decision was made...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Chamoun was the president of Lebanon at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>CHASE: Yes. Bob McClintock was our ambassador in Lebanon at the time. But our
                    planes that were going in there to help support our invasion came out of Europe,
                    and they flew down and landed in Adana at our air base down there. The planes
                    were coming in low and landing, sweeping in, just these big planes, there was
                    lots of noise. And the evening news that was then on the radio was talking about
                    Adana members attending some sort of farm fair, and he was kissing babies...What
                    are all these planes? They called up the radio station and they couldn't get any
                    news. The people at Adana were just scared to their wit's end. They didn't know
                    what was happening, why all these planes were coming in, and they needed at
                    least an indication that the Turkish government knew what was going on in their
                    own country. But the Turkish people were very happy. The government was happy
                    and the people were happy with the invasion of Lebanon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mainly because it seemed to be stopping a spread of sort
                        of what was then called Nasserism.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Nasser was not involved in Lebanon. But it was a spread of disintegration.
                    They feared communal rioting. That's happened now in Lebanon.</p>
                <p>One other aspect of this. Thinking of Turkey as a country, and that Turkey is one
                    of the countries that I think is very much misunderstood in the American public.
                    The Turks have a tremendous history. We went in there in 1947 with a Truman
                    Doctrine, and the way Turkey looked then, and the way Turkey looks today is so
                    different. The average bus ride, as I understood, public bus fare was only
                    something two or three miles long in 1947, because the buses couldn't go any
                    place; there were no roads.</p>
                <p>[START OF SIDE B MISSING]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...50 miles.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Fifty miles. I may be wrong. It took our road man, who went over there to
                    build roads in '47, he said when he got to Ankara and went to a place called
                    Konya, which is about 130 miles south of Ankara, it had been a three-day drive
                    to go down there, and now it's about a two-hour drive. Now this has made over
                    that country terrifically, all the different infrastructures that they had. If
                    you think of the old Point Four Program, remember that glorious slogan? It also
                    goes back to Truman with the Marshall Plan maybe. Israel is also a country that
                    has had a tremendous development. The country is just revolutionized because of
                    massive infusion of capital and technical know-how. Turkey has also been changed
                    from one country to a completely different country because of a tremendous
                    amount of foreign help.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this is a very interesting picture of Turkey at
                        that period, which is one that we don't have in our collection. You came
                        back to Washington then. First you were with Consular Affairs '59 to
                        '61.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: I came back as a special assistant to Johnny Haines, who was administrator
                    of the Bureau of Security and Consular Affairs. At that time, it did have SY as
                    part of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what were you doing mainly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: I was in his office, working with Roland Welch and Ralph Hilton to try to
                    find ways to run consular activities more efficiently. Roland Welch had been the
                    fellow who developed the so-called Montreal Plan of visa processing. He was
                    special assistant to Lloyd Henderson as a career minister. Ralph Hilton and I
                    were in Haines's office, and the three of us were working together to find what
                    could we do to promote better consular operations, through technology, training,
                    publicity. And I stayed there for about two years on that job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much, looking at this, did Consular Affairs grasp the
                        attention of the Department of State per se? Did you find that it was sort
                        of hard to get anybody's interest at the working level to think about it, or
                        was this considered...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: It was a back issue people weren't considering as important. The
                    geographic bureaus were very much interested in running their consular sections,
                    and they didn't want SCA to interfere with them. On technical advice and things
                    like that, that was all right. The Montreal Plan of visa operations was only
                    then being installed in these various offices. Roland Welch was roaming the
                    world, visiting posts in order to help these offices actually get this system
                    going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the interrelationship of the
                        various bureaus? Did some seem stronger and more confident than others? What
                        was your impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Oh, yes, there's quite a difference. EUR, the European Bureau, was running
                    a tight ship. They knew what they were doing, and they were giving the consular
                    operations a lot of direction that was dynamic, and they knew what they wanted
                    to accomplish. I thought ARA, Latin America, was a poorly run office
                    altogether.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's had this reputation for years, you could almost say a
                        century. Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>CHASE: Later on I was assigned to the assistant secretary's office in ARA as kind
                    of a staff assistant, special assistant. When I was there, I again had the
                    feeling that it was being run very poorly. Ed Martin came in. He had no ARA
                    background, but he was a tough cookie, and he, I think, did a great deal for
                    making the bureau pull itself up and run better. There's an awful lot of
                    localitis in all these offices, but ARA, I think, has been asleep at the switch
                    for ages. Now NEA, the Near Eastern area, on political, economic, personnelwise
                    they, I think, like the EUR, had a lot of talent, they knew how to handle the
                    talent, and they did a good job. ARA was not that way. FE, the Far Eastern area,
                    I didn't have that strong a feeling of how good they were. I think they were
                    pretty good, but I thought EUR was probably the best run, and NEA next best.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had these three assignments. What were you doing in
                        Personnel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: I got a job that was rather a confused job, because Personnel at the time
                    didn't really know what it was trying to do. They had a number of little
                    gimmicks that they were playing with. I was in the Planning Division of
                    Personnel, working on the development of language-designated positions, tours of
                    duty, and rotational assignments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you moved on. You said you were in ARA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Then I went from Personnel, it was again where they were cutting back on
                    staff. I think that Personnel at that time was having troubles knowing what it
                    was really doing and how it was doing it. That is, in the planning. In the
                    assignments offices and things, I think they were possibly doing a lot better.
                    But planning, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mainly because of time constraints, I'd like to move on to
                        Ottawa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Then I went up to Ottawa because my tour time at the department was coming
                    to an end, four years, and that was a place I could go to and get schooling for
                    my children, which was at that time very important. So I looked around to find a
                    job that I could grab, and it turned out to be in Ottawa as head of the embassy
                    consul section and also coordinator of consular activities throughout
                    Canada.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You served there from '63 to '68. Canada has always had,
                        particularly in this period, a real spread of consulates. How did they fit
                        into the system? Were they purely working offices, for the local visas,
                        passports, and that sort of thing, or did they play much of a role in our
                        overall American-Canadian policy at the time we're talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>CHASE: Back in history, we had, in 1900 I think it was, forty-some consular posts
                    up in Canada. When I was there, there were ten consular posts. If you think of
                    certain functions being important, then you need the number offices to carry out
                    these activities. So that when we had forty, that was a time when there was a
                    lot of shipping going backing forth, and their crews left visas all over the
                    place. When I was there, each one of the offices, I think, was carrying out a
                    very important function. There was not a marginal post among them, at least at
                    the beginning.</p>
                <p>Canada itself is big. It's so much like the United States. But to an extent, if
                    you go around in Canada, it's an archipelago. It's a whole lot of little islands
                    of activity that don't always relate one to the other; they're little
                    principalities.</p>
                <p>So that Newfoundland has its problems and it's a perspective. We had some
                    important military establishments up there. And whether we were going to be able
                    to carry them out required we had a consulate there that would keep in touch
                    with the Newfie government and see things were done.</p>
                <p>In Halifax, the consulate general is at the site of the Military Atlantic Command
                    for Canada. I think it's one of the three major headquarters. It has some other
                    important industries, coal mining and things. They gave out quite a number of
                    visas.</p>
                <p>St. John, over in New Brunswick, was there just as really an immigrant
                    visa-issuing mill. If you don't have immigrants, there's no reason to have a
                    consulate. New Brunswick is economically unimportant, politically
                    unimportant.</p>
                <p>Then in Quebec Province is Quebec City, which is the capital of the province, and
                    if you're thinking about what is going on in Quebec right now, the same forces
                    were afoot then. Montreal was not only a big, major visa-issuing post, but it
                    also is the hub of the economy, the political, the education.</p>
                <p>So that each one of these posts is important.</p>
                <p>Windsor, again, it's important or it's not important. See, a lot of aliens were
                    living in the United States. They weren't eligible for adjustment of visa
                    status. It was arranged that they could enter Canada and then come back into the
                    United States. And that was Windsor's business, and St. John's business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how about the ambassador, Walton Butterworth? Did he
                        pay much attention to the consulates? He was involved in other things. I
                        mean, these were in many ways performing more technical functions, weren't
                        they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>CHASE: Butterworth knew what was going on, and he kept his fingers on those
                    things that were important. It was surprising to me the way he would come into a
                    consular problem that would interest him, that was affecting the political and
                    economic relationships of Canada, and he knew exactly what he wanted to know
                    about that. Some of these public relations things, the draft dodger issue,
                    Americans fleeing to Canada to escape the draft, Butterworth knew about that
                    very, very definitely. And yet whether Montreal gave out a hundred visas a day
                    or five visas a day, he wouldn't be interested in that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our attitude? The Vietnam War was peaking at this
                        point, and people were using Canada as a means to get away. What was sort of
                        both the official and you might say what was the attitude of the ambassador,
                        in other words, towards these people? I mean, they're making their choice,
                        let 'em live with it, or do something to 'em?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: We were concerned by the political implications of this. The total number
                    of draft evaders was really pretty small. It was, though, something that was
                    embarrassing to us. Since it was embarrassing, we were trying to do various
                    things to downplay it, so the newspapers, both in the United States and Canada,
                    wouldn't do anything about it. They wouldn't give these people publicity. I had
                    lots of talks with draft dodgers, and I also had lots of talks with the draft
                    boards down in the United States, and finally evolved the approach that we had
                    to handle this issue very carefully because we were also going to be violating
                    the United States' civil liberties. And also really almost a third of the
                    Canadian men, during the draft ages, were technically US draft dodgers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because of going to school in the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: They were going to these schools, yes. Some were dual nationals. You'd
                    have a person who had lived all their life in New Brunswick and yet when their
                    mother was expecting them, instead of going to a hospital in Canada, which was
                    remote, they went across the border to a hospital in the United States. So this
                    child, a hundred percent Canadian but by accident had been born in the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>As the child was growing up, there would be a little bit of a funny affair at the
                    border. The family would come up and they'd say, “What's your nationality?”</p>
                <p>And they'd say, “We're all Canadian.”</p>
                <p>And the immigration officer would say, “Where were you born?”</p>
                <p>The fellow says, “In Maine.”</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>“You're an American citizen, come on in, you Yank. What are you going to do,
                    associate with all these Canucks up here?” And they'd joke along in this
                    way.</p>
                <p>That little kid, over the years, going back and forth, always “American
                    citizen.”</p>
                <p>Then at eighteen years six months, the immigration officer says, “Where's your
                    draft card?”</p>
                <p>“I'm a Canadian!”</p>
                <p>“Hell you are, you're an American. You've been coming in here all the time.” And
                    so then the fellow would say, “Well, then you're refusing to register for the
                    draft?”</p>
                <p>“You're damn right I am.”</p>
                <p>“All right, abandon residence in the United States to avoid the draft.” Or he'd
                    tell him, “Okay, go up to the consulates and renounce your citizenship.”</p>
                <p>And then the consular officers also told him he had to renounce his citizenship
                    because he didn't want to register for the draft. And so I then instructed my
                    consular officer, I said, “For Christ's sake, look at this case realistically.
                    Is this fellow a Canadian or is he an American? It's just an accident of birth
                    that he is a US citizen. And what you do is you fill it out, saying: 'I am
                    renouncing my citizenship because I realize there are conflicts in the
                    citizenship. I don't want to be a dual national, I only want to only be a single
                    national.'”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In other words, not to taint it for later on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Right, why taint it? Well, we had a whole lot of these little cases, where
                    a lot of Canadians were being labeled draft dodgers.</p>
                <p>And then Butterworth and I had a long conversation with the head of the Canadian
                    National Bank. His son went down to Harvard to get a degree, was offered a good
                    job, and the job was going to involve his taking up residency down there in the
                    United States. So he went down and did his work, and this went along very
                    happily. And then along came the draft notice.</p>
                <p>Well, the fellow, first of all, thought that he would never be called, thought
                    he'd have a draft deferment. But eventually, by God, he has no alternative, he
                    has come. So then he comes back to Daddy and says, “I've got to get out of the
                    United States, I can't stay there any longer, I'll be drafted. But also I will
                    then make myself permanently ineligible to go back to the United States.”</p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>Well, a whole lot of different politicians called up, saying can't you help this
                    young man? He came and called on Butterworth, and Butterworth asked me to come
                    in, and we talked to him. And finally this fellow really admitted that he was a
                    goddamn draft dodger. When the things were good in the United States, he'd taken
                    it. When the things began to become difficult, he suddenly remembered he wasn't
                    an American.</p>
                <p>And that sort of, what do they call it, summer soldier? really that concept still
                    irritates me. And Butterworth, in various ways, said, “Look, in this life it's a
                    matter of making choices. And if you make a choice and you accept the goodies,
                    you then have to pay the piper when that comes around.”</p>
                <p>Now for the other side, the Canadian who just was tricked into it, he had utmost
                    sympathy. And what we found out, though, our US Draft Boards were purposely
                    picking up Canadians, because they'd look over their roster and they knew Johnny
                    and Bill and Jim all had families living in their districts, but Oscar from
                    Canada doesn't have anybody around here, so we'll draft him. There was an awful
                    lot of skullduggery. On these things, the draft issue was a very maligned issue.
                    It was a political issue.</p>
                <p>We did have a major case that I think got me in particularly good graces with
                    Butterworth and Joe Scott, the DCM. We had an FBI agent come up into Canada and
                    conduct an investigation without clearance, as if he was doing it down in the
                    United States. This was again a draft dodger case, and that really hit the
                    fan.</p>
                <p>And we had another case of a fellow who was actually involved in drugs, Revard.
                    He was living in Montreal and had a network going down into Mexico. His runner
                    was picked up at the border. The fellow had a telephone number; it turned out to
                    be a public telephone. We discovered who he was, and we then began to try and
                    extradite him to the United States for drugs. And then this fellow found a way
                    that he began to bribe people. In fact, there was a lead that was going into
                    Pearson's cabinet, Lester Pearson, the prime minister. So here was one of our
                    people, the Customs at this time working legitimately. We were going after
                    Revard, and all of a sudden the trail of this was leading us around to bribery
                    within the Pearson cabinet, which, if the thing had developed the way it
                    appeared to be, Pearson would have been disgraced and thrown out of office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did that resolve itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: The real thing there was to realize what the danger was and be sure that
                    the prosecution of Revard was handled in a way that didn't go beyond anything
                    other than to get Revard. We eventually were pretty sure that this other trail
                    wouldn't involve bribery of the cabinet, but it was a danger there if it had
                    come out. This Revard, the FBI going up there... There were some other consular
                    problems that did threaten our...</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHASE: As much as I had disliked my assignment to Montreal I liked my assignment
                    to Ottawa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You then went from a place which had a lot of business to
                        one that was just overwhelming in business practically. This was Manila. You
                        were there from '68 to '70. How did that assignment come about, and what
                        were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Well, I was the consul general in Manila. I was in charge of the consular
                    office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember, because I was consul general in Saigon at the
                        same time, and we used to look at your operation from some distance

                </p>
                <p>CHASE: We had fifty, sixty people in the consular section. And it was a... The
                    Philippines had made official protests, because by law 20,000 immigrant visas
                    could be issued to Filipinos, and we had missed, the year before I got there.
                    The Filipinos were complaining of discrimination. For reasons, my predecessor
                    hadn't been able to get things going, so I was asked to go over there and make
                    the consular section produce.</p>

                <p>CHASE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was immigration the main job of the consulate? You must
                        have had quite a few other things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Well, immigration and nonimmigrant visas, and we had a very high rate of
                    fraud.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this fraud within the section, or was this fraud just
                        fraudulent documents?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>CHASE: Any place you could think of fraud occurring, it occurred. Fraudulent
                    documents, fraudulent saying I'm going over there to visit my dying mother who's
                    visiting or something else, that can be fraud. Everyone was saying, well, I have
                    to come back to the Philippines, and going in as a fraudulent nonimmigrant,
                    that's one sort of fraud. Then we had a great deal of fraud in finding out who
                    is making the application for the immigrant visa. And fraud to the extent of
                    fraudulent documents: fraudulent police records, fraudulent education, like for
                    the third preference professional, fraudulent for that. Then we had quite a lot
                    of fraud, too, of people claiming to be US citizens who weren't.</p>
                <p>We had a case of a fellow who made application as the spouse of a US citizen. He
                    admitted he had been married before, and that marriage had been terminated in
                    the death of his wife. Had the death certificate. We questioned the death
                    certificate of the wife, whether it was valid, and got a suspicion it wasn't
                    valid. The fellow then came in with a picture of himself in mourning in front of
                    the tomb of his wife. Well, we had a local investigator, and in the course of
                    his wanderings around, he ended up in the fellow's town and even ended up in bed
                    with the wife. I didn't find out about being in bed with the wife until later.
                    But he said, “Oh, yes, she's alive.” The husband was threatening the wife that
                    he'd have her killed if she ever revealed that she wasn't dead.</p>
                <p>Then an American citizen who claimed that a child was his. He acknowledged that
                    he and his wife were not married at the time the child was born, but he said,
                    “It's my child, and I was there.” We got evidence that this possibly wasn't
                    altogether correct. At the Catholic maternity ward that the birth took place on,
                    the investigator went to the office and noticed that the pen that had written
                    the entry before and the one after wasn't quite the same ink, didn't look the
                    same, and that there were some erasures or something on this document. It was a
                    bound volume which confirmed that this child was born at a certain time and all
                    that. Well, the investigator, talking to the nun, finally the nun broke down and
                    signed the confession that she had altered the record.</p>
                <p>We said to the fellow, “Well, look, you couldn't be the father of the child
                    because you were in Washington, DC at the time the child had to be
                    conceived.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Oh, I made a trip to the Philippines.”</p>
                <p>And he went through all sorts of things to establish that he had made a
                    mysterious 24-hour visit to the Philippines.</p>
                <p>Now there was a fellow who was kind of a friend of mine in the passport office,
                    who was under all sorts of pressure from Congress to get this child documented.
                    In fact, we were getting telegrams saying: “We want a telegram from you by
                    tomorrow morning to confirm that the US passport was issued to this child.”</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>I told the fellow who was head of the passport section, I said, “Look, just sign
                    the passport. It has to be issued.”</p>
                <p>And the fellow said, “No, I won't.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, I sympathize with you on this. You don't believe this child is a
                    citizen. I don't believe he is a citizen. But look, the State Department has
                    told us to do it. They have seen all the evidence and they say we gotta do it.
                    So look, you fix up the passport and bring it in to me and I'll sign it.”</p>
                <p>It took me about two days to get that fellow to even let his clerks go ahead and
                    issue it. He always had an excuse. And I was getting quite furious, because I
                    knew it was a fraud. So finally we got the passport issued.</p>
                <p>And some months later, after we kept sending in these other bits of reports as we
                    found them out, we then got a word from the department that, yes, they agreed
                    that it was a fraud and so they were prosecuting this lieutenant commander in
                    the Navy for malicious activities. I think he maybe got a bad note in his file
                    someplace or other.</p>
                <p>But this officer in the passport office, who had angered me a little bit, he
                    said, “Look, you were right, it was a fraud, but they are a loving family. They
                    are approaching this as if they are father, son, wife. Why not let them have the
                    sense that this is a true, binding notion?”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Look, the laws just aren't built that way. If you want to have the
                    laws made to conform to that, fine, I'm willing to carry out.” You know the guy
                    I'm speaking of, I'm sure. His opinion on this lasted I think for about six,
                    eight, ten months, and they were finally reversed, that love and affection
                    didn't give citizenship.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Philippine government and
                        the officials you dealt with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Corrupt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just corrupt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: I would say corrupt. The Philippine women were attractive, they were
                    smart, and I generally thought that I could believe them. The Philippine men
                    were just malicious—maybe in a very nice way. They are two-faced. There were
                    some wonderful people out there, but so many of them were so bad. Now I should
                    add in this that I am a little bit hypersensitive on them, in that one of my
                    sons was shot by hoodlums.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHASE: That kind of affected all my attitude toward them. Not just the attitude
                    of the fact that my son was shot, but it gave me a personal relationship with a
                    whole slew of different people, where I just found that they were doing
                    everything a little bit wrong.</p>
                <p>The police officer who went to court and said, “I arrested Eric Yagelo with the
                    pistol.” He told me later, “He didn't have the pistol when I arrested him. I had
                    to go to his house and I found the pistol there. The maid let me in, and I told
                    the maid that she'd be arrested for prostitution if she ever let anyone know
                    that I'd come inside the house.” I mean, he was an awfully nice guy, but he was
                    instructed by Marcos to prosecute the case against the people who shot my son.
                    And so he broke the law in every which way it was possible. He got the guilty
                    party, but absolutely no due process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Often the consular section can see a relationship between
                        parties, within the embassy and outside, better than anyone else, because
                        consular officers have things to give away, visas, passports to issue that
                        people want. What was the relation, would you say, between the line of
                        officers, economic, but particularly the political officers, and even the
                        military officers and whatever you would call it, the ruling class of the
                        Philippines, the very wealthy people? Was it close, too close, or objective?
                        We're talking about a period of time, '68 to '69.</hi>

                <p>CHASE: Were you trying to imply were we being patsies for Marcos?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'm not sure that Marcos was considered as bad a
                        person then, but I'm just thinking almost of a class thing. I mean, were we
                        co-opted by the ruling class of the Philippines?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: No. I think I know the accusation or the implication. I have been in some
                    countries, I've known some diplomatic officers who can't see any evil in the
                    people with whom they're associating all the time. I've been some other places
                    where the officers can only see evil. But in the Philippines I never got any
                    idea that any of us were being co-opted by the nice parties that we were
                    attending. We knew that these people were entertaining us for their reasons.
                    Some of these people were wonderful people, true blue. We also knew that a lot
                    of them were completely Machiavellian, and I don't think that we were being
                    hoodwinked. Because I think that in my relationship with them, when I was seeing
                    our political officers, our ambassador dealing with them, that we were doing
                    what we thought was necessary to advance the interests of the United States.</p>

                    careers were Vietnam. In the regular Foreign Service, we had a large number of

                    there and you'll get any assignment you want when you finish up. The promise was
                    made in good faith but absolutely never carried out. There was generally a
                    desire to help them, but we tried to be good to everybody. Now with you, of
                    course, we had to be honest.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHASE: I recall I was somewhat involved with one officer who was assigned to
                    Vietnam, who definitely didn't want to go. He had only been married about a year
                    or so. I think you were there at the time. The officer went, and very quickly
                    thereafter his marriage broke up, which I felt just terrible about. I didn't
                    like the way we forced this fellow to go to Vietnam, and I think the way we
                    handled the whole thing was bad.</p>

                        It was probably the only time in the Foreign Service that being a junior
                        officer had a certain amount of clout within the service.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>CHASE: A person is a consular officer forever, he's an economic officer forever,
                    a political officer forever. There are certain interfunctional jobs, so to say,
                    where it's a little bit of this and a little bit of that. It's a good concept,
                    it has some validity, but I think it caused a lot of heartache, among the junior
                    officers in particular. And I think we now have pretty well moved out of
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There have always been accusations in the Foreign Service
                        that it's very much an old boy network, who you know, where you get
                        assigned, and if you get the right assignment you get promoted and move up.
                        You know, we're always looking at eras, and this was '70 to '73, how much
                        was the assignment process one of people with maybe the best faith in the
                        world but if they knew somebody, it was easier to say well, that person
                        would fit in such and such a job, and then just take a name, how much would
                        you say it was by word of mouth and how much by sort of the automatic
                        assignment process?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>CHASE: Oh, in some respects I think I would deny that that sort of old boy
                    network applied, yet I know that to an extent it did. But it was not a malicious
                    thing. We would work with officers, be they consular, economic, or political,
                    trying to find the best available assignments for each person each time. And
                    there was never any thought that that SOB, we're going to give him the shaft and
                    give him just what he doesn't want. As mad as we would get at officers for
                    harassing us and causing troubles and bringing pressure to bear, I don't know of
                    any time that we ever let that influence us so that we did something to get even
                    with somebody. I don't think that ever happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about the prot�g� system within the Foreign
                        Service? In other words, as I do some interviews, looking at people with
                        careers who have moved on, particularly those who became ambassadors, a
                        significant number of them served as staff aides, often for the same person
                        in a couple of jobs. I mean, they were given assignments usually as staff
                        aides or within the department, which usually placed them into positions
                        where they were going to come to the notice of more senior officers, and
                        often this seems to have worked. Did you have a feeling about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: If an officer does well and his record is great, then people are coming in
                    and saying look, we want that officer to go into this assignment or that
                    assignment. And you know that when you assign the person to a plum job that he's
                    going to do a good job. It's unfortunate, but not all officers perform as well
                    as others. There are different caliber levels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's a judgement process within the assignment process.
                        The assignment officers have a pretty good fix on who is more capable than
                        others.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Well, we sat next to God, maybe we were God. Yes, we had to make a
                    judgement call. You'd try to figure out are the two people going to get along
                    together? Will the officer really be able to perform? If an officer is in one
                    position and doesn't do well, then the next job you give him has a different
                    challenge mix. I'm sure that you had your experiences, that some people working
                    for you did swell and some people didn't. And sometimes the person who did well
                    for you one time maybe didn't do as well for you the next time.</p>
                <p>I know of one officer I admired very highly, and he got assigned to be principal
                    officer of a very important post. Gee, he arrived and nothing happened. I have
                    never been able to figure out what went wrong. And my only suspicion is this
                    officer had done very well when he worked as a second in command, but when he
                    got to be first in command and had to dress himself, he fell apart.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, it happens. Well, just one further thing on this. In
                        Personnel, there wasn't, I take it, at this time a great deal of pressure
                        from AFSA, the American Foreign Service Association, which is sort of the
                        union of the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: It's a professional organization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, all right, in fact, you worked for them later on, so
                        you've got the lingo down. But it was not a very active organization within
                        Personnel at that particular time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: When I was in Personnel, AFSA was just moving in.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just beginning to move in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: They were gearing themselves up. There were the young Turks that had taken
                    over in AFSA and were beginning to make demands as if they were an exclusive
                    bargaining unit, which they later on became. I went to several meetings with
                    AFSA people, where they were outlining what they were thinking and where they
                    wanted to push the Foreign Service. And at that time I was saying well, I
                    basically agree with unions, but you, AFSA, keep out of my network, we're doing
                    the right thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is always, you might say, it depends on you are where
                        you sit, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Well, at that time AFSA letters were being published and circulars were
                    being distributed making certain complaints. One of these complaints was to the
                    effect that we, the Foreign Service, were discriminating against women. Hogwash!
                    I love women.</p>
                <p>I later on suddenly began to think about that, and I know that I in my Foreign
                    Service career have discriminated blatantly against women. Maybe I shouldn't
                    tell you this, but I think it should go on the record, that I sat on the
                    promotions panel for junior officers, and at the last day, as we were about to
                    sign off our list, the thing came up to us and they had a name that wasn't
                    familiar. We looked it over and saw it, and they said, “Oh, that lady has just
                    married.” In fact, she married one of her fellow officers. Then we put the
                    things together and said, “Oh, yes, yes, what happened, where's her husband? Is
                    he on the list?” And we discovered we hadn't promoted him. They had come into
                    the service at the same time together, they were coming up for promotion
                    together, and now as a wedding present, we were going to promote the wife over
                    the husband? And we looked at it, “Can we find a way to promote the husband?”
                    No, he was just too far down the list. So, to save the marital harmony, we took
                    the wife's name off the promotion list.</p>

                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Our sense of values was then much different. And I can recall in the
                    Foreign Service the first time I knew of one of my friends who was going to have
                    a woman as his boss. We all thought, my gosh, how can you work in this
                    situation, have a woman as your boss? Then as times went along, and I had a
                    woman boss, Barbara Watson, long before that I had turned the corner and I
                    thought Barbara Watson was a terrific boss.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Most of us who have gone through this, I mean, it's really
                        almost a necessary thing, at least for men of our generation to go through,
                        and usually brought us around to become true believers. Shall we go to when
                        you worked for Barbara Watson? You worked for Consular Affairs in what,
                        special...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: I was director of the Office of Special Consular Services, which was the
                    office responsible for protecting Americans overseas in cases of arrest, death,
                    estates. We did legal services relating to people being overseas. We did
                    shipping and seamen, a whole potpourri of things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You did this from '73 to '75. I wonder if you could
                        explain the role of Consular Affairs as you saw it, and Barbara Watson, who
                        was sort of a dominating figure at that time, how she operated and what her
                        influence was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: I'm not sure I understand what aspect of it... Let me say, I admired
                    Barbara Watson terrifically. She was, I think, very much devoted to making
                    consular activities respected and ensuring that the work was done well. She was
                    a person that was always approachable. I used to meet her once a week for staff
                    meetings. On quite a number of occasions we went on trips together. I admired
                    her terrifically. She had, most of the time I was there, Frances Knight in the
                    passport office. While theoretically subordinate to the assistant secretary,
                    Frances Knight had political access that gave her a high degree of independence.
                    And she insisted upon her independence in all sorts of ways.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>There had been a person who had been director of the SCS, I can't think what his
                    name is right now. He had also been a longtime civil servant, never moved, never
                    saw anything overseas. He was neanderthal in his management style, he was petty,
                    but he couldn't be moved.</p>
                <p>Barbara Watson had the problem of dealing with these various people, and to an
                    extent the only way she could handle it was to let the calendar take its toll at
                    the appointed year. And so when these people reached that mandatory age, they
                    struggled to hang on in one way or another but eventually were forced to retire
                    under Civil Service laws. They could retire with good pensions, but they wanted
                    to continue on.</p>
                <p>It was working under that constraint that she had the title, but she didn't have
                    the authority. Trying to really control what was going on in the passport office
                    under Frances Knight, Barbara had a terrific time of trying to keep that Right
                    Wing rigidity under some sort of leash.</p>
                <p>With the former head of my office, I think it was a matter of tolerating
                    inefficiency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What caused you your major concerns?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: When I was in SCS?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Oh, they varied, a number of things. In one respect, I was very much
                    concerned about proper training for people going overseas to do these jobs. FSI
                    had a good program, but there wasn't that continuation of how can you really
                    continue to give guidance and have the work being done efficiently and
                    accurately. Because so frequently, in each post, much of the SCS work, as well
                    as much of the consular work, is done by newcomers to the service. They don't
                    have any history of knowing what's gone on before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So often a job is given to a junior officer for one tour
                        who then moves on elsewhere, and so somebody dealing on a consular matter
                        has a very good chance of running into somebody who's brand new, not only to
                        the consular work but also to the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: I can recall making mistakes myself when I was a new officer, not
                    realizing that people would present problems to me under frameworks that would
                    lead me to make the wrong decision.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>Trying to be sure that the people had adequate guidance, we were running into a
                    lot of trouble with Americans being imprisoned overseas. All the time I was
                    there, the number of jailings was escalating, much of it drug-related.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A great many of these were not at a very high professional
                        level. A great many of these were fairly young kids who might have been
                        involved in a very petty way of moving maybe some hashish or marijuana or
                        something. I mean, it wasn't the hard-core professionalism we ran into later
                        on, at least from my experience in Athens.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Well, a number of these people were the newels, so to say, that related to
                    those drug cases. We had two cases that ended up in the movies. One was this
                    fellow in Turkey, Hayes, who was transporting hashish and got caught. He had a
                    difficult time in jail, but most of his difficulties were self-generated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was in a Turkish jail, and the movie was Midnight
                        Express.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Yes, and very little of that film was true. Hayes was just a troublemaker.
                    I don't think this came out in the movie, but to an extent he was free, he
                    shouldn't have been caught. Because he got on the plane, the plane was getting
                    ready to take off, and some mechanical thing completely unrelated to him, and
                    then it was after he came off the second time in Istanbul that he finally was
                    picked up. It was unfair that they prosecuted him for one drug charge, which he
                    appealed, and they then doubled the ante, they increased the number of charges.
                    I don't think that the prosecutor should up the ante, penalize a person for
                    appealing.</p>
                <p>Then we had another case that was much more interesting. It was called that
                    Antakya Seven, where a group of people loaded up a Volkswagen van in Beirut and
                    were driving back to Germany, and they were picked up at Antakya, coming into
                    southern Turkey. The van was loaded up with stuff, and this group of seven,
                    three women and four men, were thrown in jail. And they had all sorts of
                    adventures.</p>
                <p>You've got to be careful, you can jump the wrong way. Turkish jails in general
                    are not particularly good, but no jail is. And the Turkish jailers weren't
                    overly brutal. In fact, when this Antakya Seven were finally being moved from
                    one jail to another jail, partly in response to the complaints about what was
                    going on, this one woman said she took the hand of her jailer and said, “I don't
                    want to leave you. I don't want to leave you. I love you.” The prisoner was
                    being treated basically humanely. The place was basically clean. Everybody was
                    cooperative, there was no bickering, no fighting. And yet she was going to have
                    leave this area where she had gotten a degree of security, and going off to
                    something that was maybe a little glitzier but would be completely
                    impersonal.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is true. It's exactly the same. I remember
                        watching a case, from the Greek point of view, because if they'd made it,
                        they probably would have ended up in Greece and might have ended up in jail,
                        too. The Greek prisons were rather primitive, but there was far less
                        brutality and regimentation than there would be in any American jail. As
                        long as they didn't bother the guards and stayed in their cells or
                        courtyards, they could do what they wanted almost.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: We had one military person in jail in Izmir. This was at the same period,
                    not when I was there. And he volunteered that he'd heard about Hayes's case and
                    he said, “Look, I've been in jails all over the world. I've been in a number of
                    jails in the United States. And if I have to spend time in jail, let me spend it
                    here in the Turkish jail.”</p>
                <p>The consular officers in Turkey, I think, made a lot of effort to protect the
                    American citizens.</p>
                <p>In Mexico, we had a problem, and we'd had this also in several other posts, that
                    somehow or other, when the person was picked up for drugs, there was a certain
                    vindictiveness by the consular officer, so that protection was sometimes really
                    withheld. We had this case in Mexico, and it became a serious problem. Barbara
                    Watson and I went down to Mexico to straighten it out and get the consular
                    officers. And it was interesting that it came from the consul general and his
                    senior officer.</p>
                <p>This one officer, I had fought against his getting any assignment. He wasn't a
                    consular officer, he was a political officer who had run into troubles, and I
                    didn't want him as a consular officer. I battled away and made a bad name for
                    myself in Personnel. And the assignment was forced through. The guy was a nice
                    guy. I've had drinks with him and I've had dinners with him. He's a nice guy,
                    but he just didn't have the sense he was born with when it was coming to this
                    prison case. And he didn't have a real feel for consular work either. He
                    arranged that the consular officers were not giving protection to prisoners when
                    they were put in jail, and that got us into one hell of a lot of hot water.</p>
                <p>Now we had also cases of the same mentality but in the other extreme in which the
                    consular officer saw his sole job as getting every American out of jail. Don't
                    let any of them stay in jail at all. They would do everything to get the person
                    out of jail and also moved on to another consular district. That attitude I
                    objected to.</p>
                <p>So we had these jail problems. Now the other side of the jail... Down in Chile...
                    Remember Missing?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, there was a movie called Missing, I believe it came
                        from a book, about the overthrow of Allende.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>CHASE: Yes, and that took hours and months and my whole time there almost.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As I recall, it was the case of a young man who, it was
                        alleged, had been at least friendly to the Leftist side of the Left-Right
                        argument down there. And again it was alleged that the ambassador and the
                        consul and all basically told the Right Wing coup that you can do anything
                        you want with this guy. The idea is so abhorrent, it just doesn't parse in
                        Foreign Service terms, but it was bought in a book and in a movie.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: First we had the war, we had the Allende, we had a number of these
                    occasions when there was civil unrest of one sort or another. We had to turn out
                    and set up these task forces, where for 24 hours around the clock people are
                    answering calls from loved ones in the United States, and you're trying to
                    direct the people in the field to give as much support as possible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to the Chile case, this young man who was
                        missing and presumed dead. I don't know if they ever found his body. How did
                        you deal with this? The accusation was made that we just weren't doing
                        anything to try to help the family find their son.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: The revolt took place, and there was quite a lot of turmoil down in Chile.
                    We were receiving all sorts of messages from the embassy as to where fighting
                    was and what was happening.</p>
                <p>At the same time, we were instructing our consular section to locate all the
                    American citizens, set up rosters, and see what we could do to ensure their
                    safety and also help them communicate with family and friends back in the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>The consular people went around to where all these detention centers were and had
                    it announced: “Look, here is the American consul, is there any American citizen
                    here who wants to talk to him?” If we could find out there was an American
                    there, even if the person didn't ask to speak to us, the consular officer went
                    in and tried to confront the person and say, “Who are you? What do we know about
                    you? Can we give you any help?”</p>
                <p>We also went to the hospitals, went to the morgues, always looking out to see
                    anybody who was American. Also trying to be sure that our telephone lines were
                    open if somebody was calling up to say they needed help or that they may have
                    heard that some American down the street was arrested. We had a fair idea as to
                    how many Americans were around, through just the general registration of
                    Americans.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>With the Chile case, there was a group of about three or four Americans that we
                    could not seem to locate anyplace. The consular people went and talked to the
                    people who last saw them alive to get information as to where were they going
                    when they were being arrested and what have you. We then went to the places
                    where we thought the people were being taken and insisted upon the right of
                    going through and looking at every dead person. We did as many things as we
                    possibly could to find Hamil. We were browbeating the Chileans at all levels in
                    the official government as to where was this fellow.</p>
                <p>I should say that our military attach� knew he'd seen Hamil a couple of days
                    before down in the port city, and yet the military and CIA had no reason to feel
                    that even they wanted this fellow arrested. He was nothing. He was unknown to us
                    for any reason of interest. We were, though, interested when he was missing to
                    locate him.</p>
                <p>We kept pressing the Chileans in respect to all the deceased, of who were they
                    and what was happening. We were sending telegrams back and forth concerning
                    teeth, fingerprints, dentures, anything that was distinguishing. And we just
                    couldn't find him.</p>
                <p>Eventually, though, when the whole flock of unidentified people was shrinking,
                    the Chileans were coming out, you got down to a smaller number, and they then
                    identified a fingerprint. It wasn't the same fingerprint. It had been one of
                    these fingerprints that had been put through and carded. I don't know how they
                    do it with fingerprints, but it's HJ167 or something like that. One of the major
                    characteristics was not Hamil's, but the others seemed to be somewhat similar.
                    So then they called for to look through those fingerprints again, and they found
                    out that there had been a mistake in categorizing. Like when you get down to a
                    typewriter and you spell one word and the word “cad” becomes “had.” It's still
                    logical, but there is a major error made and it's a... until it seemed to be a
                    completely innocent error.</p>
                <p>As despicable as the Chileans did so many things, this, insofar as we could
                    determine, was not done with real malice aforethought. And very definitely our
                    consular officer down there I think did a splendid job, and our ambassador did a
                    wonderful job, in the way they kept pressing and pressing to try and locate what
                    had happened to this fellow.</p>
                <p>We had a case in SDS of a telegram coming in from Paris that they had just
                    received word from the French police that an American citizen had died. And they
                    gave us his name, his passport number, next of kin. We passed on the
                    information, as much as we had, and then got back more to try and find out what
                    it was all about. This fellow apparently had been bludgeoned to death out on the
                    highway someplace.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>The family was distressed, but they had a cousin who was in Spain, and they asked
                    the cousin if he'd go up to Paris and identify the remains and see what he could
                    find out. So we did all the communication, we got the cousin up there. The
                    cousin said yes, this is my so and so. They helped get the information of how
                    did the death occur. The family, in their sorrow and agony, said yes, they
                    wanted the remains to be sent home. So a coffin was arranged, the remains
                    embalmed and sent back to the United States, and it was buried.</p>
                <p>About a week after the funeral, the poor mother in Pittsburgh picked up the phone
                    when it rang. She said, “Hello.” And this distant voice says, “Hey, Mom, how are
                    you?” It was her son calling from England.</p>
                <p>As this whole thing came out, the son, when traveling through France, had met up
                    with somebody else and they'd buddied it along together. Both of them were
                    bearded and rather disheveled. The son woke up one morning and his passport was
                    missing, his money was missing, and his friend was missing. So this young chap,
                    a resourceful young fellow, made his way along up the coast. He wanted to get to
                    England and he got over to England. He went along and picked up some money here
                    and there, like a normal flower child of that time, and he was having a fine
                    time. But he hadn't spoken to his family, so he called home—only to discover
                    that he was officially dead.</p>
                <p>The other chap, nobody quite knew who he was, had apparently come to a no-good
                    end. But seeing that bearded face and the same general physique of the friend,
                    the cousin had identified him and said yes, and nothing had happened, they
                    hadn't opened up the coffin when they brought him home to the United States, so
                    nobody saw him until he was buried.</p>
                <p>The family, of course, was overjoyed that they had their son back again. But a
                    few weeks later, the father wrote to the State Department: “I want my money back
                    on flying the coffin over!”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, God. Well, you retired in '75, is that right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you retired, you then became involved for awhile with
                        AFSA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Yes, I became a counselor for AFSA. I'm not a lawyer, but I had the
                    diplomatic title of counsel. We were handling labor-management negotiations with
                    the State Department, in accordance to a contract that had been agreed to
                    between the AFSA, which was acting as a union under a law of Congress. We had
                    the rights to negotiate with the State Department on all sorts of matters
                    relating to working conditions, not salaries.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: That was '76 to '80. I also handled grievances, which were also being
                    handled under a statute. If an employee felt that he had been discriminated
                    against or subjected to some sort of unfair treatment, he could file a
                    grievance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this was the period of the real change in relations
                        within the department, where the association was playing a much broader role
                        in assignments and in grievance procedures. Not assignments, but the whole
                        way the Foreign Service dealt with people, allowances, everything else. How
                        would you describe how it was working from your vantage point there? What
                        were you dealing with, and how were things resolved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Let me divide this into two different categories.</p>
                <p>Grievances, which took up about fifty percent of my time. If an employee had a
                    complaint that his personnel folder contained false or inaccurate, malicious
                    information, he could grieve that this be removed from his file. If his
                    assignment wasn't handled in accordance to prescribed regulations. If he was
                    eligible for a school allowance for his children, a housing allowance or
                    shipping allowance, something else where the regulations were not being properly
                    carried out in his view, he would come to us, or he could go directly to the
                    grievance office, and make a complaint.</p>
                <p>There is a procedure whereby the complaint would be accepted by the State
                    Department, AID, or USIA, all the foreign affairs agencies. The agency would
                    examine it from their viewpoint to see did they agree or disagree that something
                    had gone wrong.</p>
                <p>We would then negotiate, on behalf of the employee, to see if a solution could be
                    reached that would be acceptable to the employee.</p>
                <p>To a very large extent, the State Department was making thousands of personnel
                    decisions every day. There was a very minuscule number that were being handled
                    really improperly. I believe that by correcting these mistakes, the department
                    became a much better organization. It became much more understanding, and
                    bureaucrats learned that they can make errors.</p>
                <p>Sometimes the employee would make a complaint and we would battle it through and
                    find out that the employee who thought he had a case just didn't have a case.
                    The act that he was complaining against was perfectly legitimate and had
                    frequently a very logical reason that he might not like.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>If we could not reach an agreement with the agency, at the agency level, we then
                    had the right to appeal to the Foreign Service grievance panel. This is a group
                    of professional labor-management negotiators, together with a number of Foreign
                    Service retirees. They would form a panel of three people, normally three, and
                    they would then hear us argue. It was like going to court: witnesses being
                    sworn, a record of the case being completed. And then the grievance board would
                    sit back and render a decision; they would find for the employee or they'd find
                    for the agency.</p>
                <p>In this process, as I said, I think the agencies learned a lot. I think, by
                    publishing these decisions, without the names of anyone involved, I think the
                    employees also learned a lot, that they learned something about how these
                    decisions are made.</p>
                <p>Now a very good friend of mine in the Foreign Service was going along with a good
                    career, and something went wrong. He didn't get promoted and things didn't
                    happen right. Ten years went by, and the fellow was getting long in the tooth at
                    his grade. And we found out that in his performance file there was a series of
                    very vile denunciations, very malicious accusations made by a senior person, who
                    happened to be a civil servant. The officer had never been informed of this, and
                    this was being seen by promotion panels every year. While I was in Personnel, we
                    discovered it was there, and we brought it to the officer's attention, saying,
                    “Look, you'd better come up and look at your file.” He looked at this and he was
                    aghast and he said, “That has got to come out.”</p>
                <p>This was before we had a grievance procedure, but it was also after Lloyd
                    Henderson, as Under Secretary for administration, had established a procedure
                    where in Personnel we had a grievance office. So this officer heard the
                    complaint, he took a look at the file, and he said, “Oh, gee, this is bad.” And
                    so the information was taken away. It had been there so long, there was no sense
                    in going back to try and identify who had put it in there. But it was there, and
                    this officer's career was very badly damaged by this incident.</p>
                <p>We've had other cases where a file has contained wrong information. Sometimes
                    somebody has just got a mad on. A supervisor can be mad and he'll write
                    something and put it in the file and it's wrong. The officer can now grieve and
                    get that removed immediately. Now the employees are normally shown everything
                    before it goes in the file, so they can start proceedings right away.</p>
                <p>But to turn the corner, we had bureaucratic little mix-ups. The wife of an
                    officer down in Buenos Aires was seriously ill and had to be flown up to Panama
                    for an operation. And then, after a necessary recovery, she could fly back to
                    her post.</p>
                <p>When a person is seriously ill and cannot travel alone, the regulations provide
                    that the government can hire somebody to accompany—it could be a nurse, it could
                    be a doctor, depending upon the situation—and take the patient back to where the
                    patient needs to go.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>In this particular case I'm speaking of, the employee left Buenos Aires and went
                    to Panama to be with his wife for the operation. When she was out of the
                    hospital for a necessary number of days, then he accompanied her when she needed
                    to have somebody accompany her. So he got back to post and filed an application
                    for reimbursement of just his transportation costs for accompanying his wife.
                    His application for travel was refused; his wife's was approved. He then said,
                    “Well, why? It says here in the regulations that when an accompaniment has to be
                    along, that can be paid.” Well, in this case, they turned him down, and he kept
                    being told: “No, no, no, disallowed, disallowed, disallowed.”</p>
                <p>So he wrote up to AFSA. And I called up this fellow who had been making the
                    decision and said, “Why aren't you approving this? What's wrong?”</p>
                <p>And he said, “We can't do that. He claims he wants reimbursement for traveling
                    Buenos Aires to Panama to Buenos Aires.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, that's what the regulations provide.”</p>
                <p>He said, “No, no, no. He is allowed to be compensated for accompanying his wife
                    on the trip from Panama to Buenos Aires.” And he said, “Well, the person who
                    does the accompanying has to then get back to Panama, so that's all right.”</p>
                <p>This bureaucrat was willing to approve it as long as the request came through to
                    go from Panama to Buenos Aires and return, rather than Buenos Aires to Panama
                    and return. This guy, I've known him for years, and why he talked himself into
                    being so stupid I don't know. The thing was, not only was he stupid, but he
                    wouldn't tell the fellow what was happening and why, so he could make the
                    request.</p>
                <p>Years before, coming home from Turkey, we flew to Germany and then we took a boat
                    back to New York. My wife was taken ill, and we were put off the boat at
                    Southampton. We had to spend a week in Southampton until she was fit to travel
                    again.</p>
                <p>When I came home, I said, “Well, look, I would like to get per diem for the week
                    I was in Southampton. This was not at my pleasure, it was one of these
                    unexpected requirements of government travel: illness en route.” And I was told:
                    “No, no, no, you can't do that.” I didn't have enough sense to look at the
                    regulations or know what I was doing. Anyway, I filled in my application, but I
                    put on a covering sheet, and I said, “Look, this is my travel voucher. However,
                    I still think that the period in Southampton should be paid for.”</p>
                <p>I got a telephone call several weeks later from some woman in Travel saying, “We
                    have read your papers and you're absolutely right. You're eligible for it.”</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>And I said, “Well, I was told I couldn't have it.”</p>
                <p>She said, “Well, whoever told you that was wrong.”</p>
                <p>Well, I had talked to somebody in the Travel Bureau, somebody who had given me
                    the wrong information. When it got to the so-called experts down the line, they
                    saw it and said, “Yes, the officer is entitled to it.”</p>
                <p>Now these little things go wrong in any organization. There must be a system that
                    you can allow for a complaint. That it is not that I am complaining against you
                    for having done me in, that I say it's the system, and it goes through another
                    channel. And I think this has brought a lot of honesty.</p>
                <p>Now my other aspects of negotiation would be, when I was working for AFSA in the
                    council, we would go into periodic meetings with various parts of the Department
                    of State, arguing about regulations that were being drafted that impacted on the
                    working conditions: Is this legitimate? Are you accomplishing a purpose? What's
                    the impact on employees? Has the employee's concern been considered?</p>
                <p>Not infrequently everything was hunky-dory. Most of the time it was hunky-dory.
                    But every once in a while we would find that they hadn't thought the thing
                    through.</p>
                <p>The unfortunate part of this is, we then at AFSA became almost part of the
                    clearance process. They would draft up the regulation, and they'd say, “Well,
                    AFSA is going to review this, and if something needs to be done, they'll tell us
                    about it.” And they did sloppy drafting. They just didn't think through what
                    they were accomplishing. And frequently it wasn't a matter of our coming in with
                    conflicting viewpoints, we'd just say, “Look, this doesn't make sense.” And
                    they'd say, “My God, you're right.” And they'd change it; no argument. So AFSA,
                    I think, was doing a wonderful job.</p>
                <p>Now one of my labor negotiating friends was an arbitrator. He's one of the
                    country's leading arbitrators, and he was approached by a labor union which was
                    having troubles in their own office. And they said, “How should we approach this
                    sort of situation?”</p>
                <p>The arbitrator said, “Look, first of all, you think you're a labor union, so
                    therefore you've been turning to labor union people to give you advice. What you
                    have to do is go to one of your manufacturer's lawyers to represent you. Because
                    you are an employer now, you're not a labor union. You are the employer. You
                    have to get the perspective. It's like playing chess. If you're playing hard and
                    you're working, and you're seeing the moves, you have to once in a while get up
                    and walk around the board and see what it looks like from the other standpoint.
                    Then you can play more effectively.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question that I'd like to ask is, if a young
                        person came to you and said, “Mr. Chase, what about the Foreign Service as a
                        career for me?”, how would you respond? We're talking about 1990 now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Well, let me say that when I joined, it was an outstanding opportunity,
                    and I think that I was extremely fortunate in getting into the Foreign Service.
                    The pay wasn't great, but it was basically, generally better than what the rest
                    of the government agencies paid. The opportunities for working and living I
                    think are just stupendous, and I enjoyed the Foreign Service and I loved my
                    career. Sometimes I had troubles, yes, but it was a good career.</p>
                <p>At the present time I continue to believe that there are tremendous opportunities
                    in the Foreign Service, and I would recommend to anyone who is interested in
                    world problems that the Foreign Service is a wonderful way of seeing the world
                    and becoming involved in the world's problems, and maybe making a significant
                    contribution to solutions.</p>
                <p>I think the salary that our people are paid, salary and fringe benefits, aren't
                    as good as they should be.</p>
                <p>And I think that the certain demands of really becoming to an extent an
                    expatriate should be recognized. We spend so much time outside of the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>I wish the hell CIA's influence would become lessened. CIA does a lot of great
                    work, but why aren't those functions transferred over to the political and
                    economic section? We actually are frequently talking to the same people, we're
                    doing the same thing, but somehow there's a mystique that the CIA can get things
                    done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, if two people come up, and one person tells you
                        something is such and such and is quite open, and the other person comes in
                        and tells you the exact same thing but I got this from a secret source,
                        guess which one is going to be acted on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>CHASE: Yes. I think the State Department for years has abdicated in letting CIA
                    operations become bigger and bigger. And they have allowed their own
                    perspectives to be narrowed, that a political officer will only talk to the
                    Foreign Office. Throughout the whole government, they don't roam out to the
                    press. We don't have as much time.</p>
                <p>I think that the language training that is now being carried out is just so much
                    better than anything that I ever experienced.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>I also believe in professionalism, to the extent that I think the Foreign Service
                    is a way of life, and we, the employee and the government, prosper if people
                    come in by the age 30 with the idea of having a lifetime career in the Foreign
                    Service. Bringing people in at the age of 40 or 50, I don't think that gives
                    them the best of vision to understanding these problems.</p>
                <p>The American people too frequently have an idea that all you have to do is
                    explain something sensibly to these foreigners, and the foreigners will then
                    realize their mistakes and come over. Or if they don't come over, it means that
                    they're stupid or that they're Communist.</p>
                <p>In Iraq, a Muslim country; in Israel, a Jewish country; in the Philippines, a
                    Catholic country, there is a mentality that is perfectly logical. Why do we
                    drive on the right-hand side of the road or the left-hand side of the road?
                    There's no sensible way for having a lot of these things, but you must
                    understand, trust them to figure this out, and they do things differently. If
                    you read the books, you can come up to all sorts of misunderstandings of what
                    they're doing. Because the system works through people, the United States must
                    know how the people in that foreign country are seeing things, and translate it
                    to their terms. (That's a little bit jumbled.)</p>
