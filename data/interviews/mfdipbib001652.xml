                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 4th of November, 2004. This is an interview
                        Greg, G-R-E-G, Thielmann. Is that pronounced correctly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: No, that's Thielmann (Tealman).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thielmann. T-H-I-E-L-M-A-N-N. Well certainly to begin
                        with, let's get a feel for when and where were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I was born in Des Moines, Iowa on March 14th, 1950, and my hometown
                    for all the way through high school was Newton, Iowa about thirty miles from Des
                    Moines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me a bit about on your father's side and
                        then your mother's side. Where did they come from and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: My father was born in Germany in 1900.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where? Do you know.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: He was born in a village called Gettorf Schleswig-Holstein to the
                    north pretty close to the Baltic seacoast. His father was an innkeeper who then
                    about the time the First World War broke out bought a farm, and then the two
                    older brothers went off to war. Both of them were killed in the war, one in the
                    west and one in the east. My father was then drafted at age eighteen and was on
                    his way marching through Belgium when the war ended. The family joke is that if
                    Armistice Day had been on say November 21 instead of November 11, we might not
                    be here. So he then after the war, his father had to sell the farm because he
                    didn't have enough labor to work on it. During the war interestingly they had
                    French and Russian prisoners of war working on the farm. But they had to get rid
                    of the farm in 1918. That was when they bought the inn apparently. My father was
                    at the time in agricultural college. He got out and worked, tried to make a
                    living in agriculture. It was about the time of the inflation of 1923 when he
                    decided to basically leave the country as an economic refugee, going to America.
                    So he went through Ellis Island in 1923 and took a train to North Dakota,
                    sponsored by some uncle in the Americas, and then worked in various places
                    around the Midwest, eventually becoming a chiropractor in Newton, Iowa, I think,
                    from the 1930s on. Interestingly very early on before he decided on becoming a
                    doctor, he had thought about joining the Foreign Service. I had a very
                    interesting 1927 Foreign Service booklet with a sample exam for anyone
                    interested in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh my gosh. Oh my gosh.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Very interesting. But he quickly found out that he had not been a U.S.
                    citizen long enough to apply and turned his attentions elsewhere.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Becoming a chiropractor, does this mean, was this a
                        college or vocational education. I mean what sort of education did he
                        have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Chiropractors basically, to go to chiropractic college you have to
                    have an undergraduate degree. My father finished up or got the equivalent of
                    that in Iowa, and then he went to Lincoln Chiropractic College in Indianapolis,
                    and they have additional, I think at the time it was maybe a few year to get a
                    chiropractic degree and bought someone's practice in Iowa from there. That's how
                    he ended up in the state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this is what he, how long did he continue in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: He continued through his death in 1977 working this one practice in
                    Newton, Iowa, interrupted only by World War Two when he was drafted at age
                    forty-two and served in military intelligence because of his French, German and
                    English.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about on your mother's side? What was her family
                        name? Where did they come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Her family name was Grimm, with two Ms. She grew up in the hillbilly
                    country of Iowa, southern Iowa, the last row of the counties next to the
                    Missouri border, Decatur County. Her father was a carpenter until a work
                    accident put out one of his eyes, and he didn't have the distance measurement
                    and he became a farmer, sort of a subsistence farmer. Those were very difficult
                    times and Iowa's soil, the poorest in the country, and she had a really rough
                    time. She was the only one in her family to go to college, and she started
                    teaching at age eighteen, I think, in the country school in Iowa. Her summer
                    jobs and her brothers helped put her through Iowa State Teacher's College, now
                    UNI, Cedar Falls, Iowa. She eventually then ended up as a teacher in Newton,
                    Iowa where she met my father having lost her voice one day and going to him with
                    laryngitis. So the family joke is, if she hadn't lost her voice, they might
                    never have hit it off because she likes to talk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, family life. Did your mother and father have
                        other children?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I have one older brother. So I was the second, second of the two.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your mother keep teaching or did she stop
                        teaching?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: She stopped teaching to raise us when we were young and then resumed
                    when, I think I was in first grade, when she went back to school. Yeah, when she
                    went back. She was a primary teacher. So she was in the same school I was, but
                    thought it wasn't right that she be my teacher. So she moved around to avoid
                    that. Would've started in first grade except that I was a first grader, but
                    ended up in several elementary positions and continued teaching until she was
                    retirement age. I think the number is twenty-seven and a half years as a teacher
                    with that interruption as a mother in between.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we're talking about the '50s and the '60s
                        particularly. What was Newton like? How do you describe Newton?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Newton was an interesting and somewhat anomalous small town in Iowa
                    because it had very heavy industrial employment. It was the home of Maytag
                    washing machines, Maytag Company and several other industries. So that the
                    town's population was 15,000, and it had something like 5,000 industrial workers
                    and big unions, an unusual town in this respect. But it was typical Iowa in many
                    other respects. There was one high school, one public high school. Everyone went
                    to public high school. There was, I can say now looking back, a great
                    homogeneity in terms of ethnicity. We had one Mexican American, one African
                    American, one Jew, and we tended to forget that they were somehow different. I
                    mean it was something that was in the back of your mind, but it was almost like
                    there were too few to discriminate against. I didn't even learn about the
                    pejorative terms for various ethnic groups until I left my hometown. My high
                    school, my homecoming date was Tamara Grolnick, the one Jew in our class. I
                    just, I mean it's really funny looking back on it. Joe Viela, our Mexican
                    American, it just didn't really loom very large. So it was a funny place, and
                    I'm not saying there wasn't discrimination. I mean, the discrimination I grew up
                    with was more, “are you Catholic or protestant. Do you live in the country club
                    section of town or the rest of town.” We were on the wrong side of the tracks —
                    always somewhat marginal because chiropractic. This was a period when the AMA
                    and drug industry were waging a full-scale war against chiropractics as quacks.
                    There's always that sort of questionable piece. There was a little bit of
                    leftover from my father's German origin. He had been accused of being a member
                    of the Bund and other things in the years leading up to the war. So it was a
                    good character building kind of education, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What, where did your family go religiously?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: My mother grew up Southern Baptist. My father was a Lutheran. So they
                    compromised and went to the Disciples of Christ, First Christian Church.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about politically? Was this, were politics part of
                        the sort of family life or—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I would say, I would say no. Certainly my father was more, I would
                    say, more apolitical. He was a registered Republican, but I almost think it was
                    more because that was a respectable thing to be as a doctor in a small town.
                    That's the appropriate class response. I see him as being very open minded on
                    things like theology, and he actually had kind of a combination of Hindu and
                    Christianity. He was a yogi from the 1950s. The picture on his bureau was of
                    Paramhansa Yogananda, his guru, which I as a kid thought was Jesus. He had long
                    hair and everything. He went to church faithfully every Sunday. I'm not clear he
                    always stayed awake, but he was very conventional in so many respects. He was
                    very sort of northern German in terms of schedule and routine. We always had
                    breakfast right at seven o'clock.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Keep to the clock.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yeah. I think order was important to him. Yet he had very
                    unconventional views about religion, and I think it was important in growing up
                    to have the sense that it was okay to have unconventional thoughts about
                    politics and the world and everything. I look back and think that it seems like
                    my career involved a number of points at which I was willing to be more
                    outspoken and dissenting than maybe some of my colleagues. I think a lot of that
                    came from that early formative period. My mother was very outspoken, probably
                    too outspoken in telling other people her views on any number of issues. So that
                    sort of feistiness and my dad's unconventional attitudes I think made an
                    impression.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about sort of around the dinner table. Were there
                        discussions about happenings in town or the world or issues or anything like
                        that? Was there—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I think, it was more happenings around town than around the world.
                    Although because my father had two sisters in Germany and we would get these
                    crinkly letters in old German script and marks upon, seemed to have cardboard on
                    the bottom of it you were supposed to eat and this sort of strange foreignness
                    was part of growing up. One of the family friends that we would visit every
                    couple of months in the Amana Colonies, Bavarian watchman who immigrated to the
                    United States in 1920s. His wife and then the former German imperial German army
                    captain of the machine gun company and then later a pacifist and theologian,
                    they all lived together in the same house. We would visit them and the old man
                    with no teeth and Bavarian accent would be chattering away in German. My dad
                    would nod and only later told me that he hardly understood a word he was saying.
                    But there was that knowledge of my dad's German roots, and he had a number of
                    friends who had also emigrated from Germany, from Schleswig-Holstein in fact,
                    and had farms here and there. So he was never a German-American. He would never
                    have hyphenated his name, I think, but he was a German-American for most other
                    people.</p>
                <p>One of the things I would observe about Germans is that most of the immigrants
                    had a very strong assimilation urge, and my dad certainly did as well. He worked
                    very hard on his English, and I think did so well that I could not hear any
                    accent although some others could. But about half the people I'd ask couldn't
                    identify any kind of foreign accent, which is not bad for someone coming to the
                    U.S. at age twenty-three — kind of unusual. So that was to me one sign of his
                    assimilation instinct and to his desire to become a citizen, a good decent law
                    abiding citizen and do what you're supposed to do as the loyal American.</p>

                <p>THIELMANN: There was a lot of reading around the house. My dad would always seem
                    to have some reading by at his chair in the living room. A lot of times it was
                    more abstract religious matters that always seemed uninteresting to me as a kid,
                    but reading from my mother's emphasis on reading as a basic skill to just
                    reading in general seemed to be a big part of my growing up. I had an early
                    interest in what was happening in the world. I'm sure stimulated by my father's
                    foreign origins. But I would pore over the kind of magazines that one looks at
                    as a teenager and became an early newspaper reader.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now what was the newspaper in Des Moines, the
                        Register?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: The newspaper was the Des Moines Register, which I would claim looking
                    back on it was one of the best newspapers for a city of 200-some thousand in the
                    entire country. I have this distinct memory of walking by the Des Moines
                    Register's printing office in Des Moines, which had a big showcase window, and
                    you could watch the presses run from the street. There was a sign in the window
                    that said, “One newspaper has won more Pulitzer prizes than the Des Moines
                    Register. Our compliments to the New York Times.” I suspect that most of them
                    were agricultural reporting although they did have a famous, actually two famous
                    political cartoonists, James Darling and Frank Miller. But looking back on the
                    '60s when I really first started paying attention to newspapers, I think today
                    that it was an outstanding newspaper, which has gotten steadily worse over the
                    years. It's now Gannett-style.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I haven't heard much, but it used to be, but yeah,
                        when you think about as I've traveled around. I'm sure you have in the
                        States, you go to cities like San Francisco or Houston or something you feel
                        as though you've fallen off the edge of the world. I mean—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: San Francisco is my favorite example for the ratio of cosmopolitan
                    citizens to crummy newspapers. It's just huge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I mean go to Houston. Terrible. I mean, and then you
                        grew up in a place that had really a major newspaper, small state and all
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: It was called “the newspaper that Iowa depends on.” It was delivered
                    every day. The trucks would go out of Des Moines in the middle of the night to
                    every one of Iowa's 99 counties. It would be there in the morning when people
                    woke up. It was one of those things which in a lot of ways bound the state
                    together. I mean this was a state that, if you were in Council Bluffs, Iowa, you
                    would think Omaha would be your orbit. If you were in Davenport, you could just
                    as easily be in Moline or Chicago, and the same with cities like Sioux City on
                    the Missouri River. In fact the state was very much influenced by this paper out
                    of Des Moines, which is more or less in the center of the state.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in the school and let's take sort of the early, well
                        the fifties, you really get going by 1960. I guess you're what by that time
                        ten years old or so? Did the political campaign of 1960 hit your town or
                        school? This was Kennedy versus Nixon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes. It certainly did, but my memories of it were kind of influenced
                    by sort of learning my identity with the Republican Party. Both my parents were
                    Republicans at that point even though my mother came out of a sort of rural
                    populace tradition and still remembers her father talking about William Jennings
                    Bryant. But they were both Republicans. So I had this vague notion that Nixon
                    was a good guy, and Kennedy was the one who shouldn't win. Then, when Kennedy
                    narrowly won, there was this issue of Cook County.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The votes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yeah, the votes there, and it seemed to me as someone just barely on
                    the edge of starting to pay attention to politics that something vaguely bad had
                    happened. I would say that, because of the influence of the small town,
                    Republicanism and my parents, that all the way through Kennedy's assassination,
                    if someone had asked me, I would've said that Kennedy was not a good president.
                    It's funny looking back on it now because I have a different view of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you do in school? I mean, with your mother being
                        in the same school with you, was this a problem or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: No, it really wasn't. It was only a problem when, for example, I was
                    talking in class and sent to the office and sitting in the corner of the office,
                    and my mother came in for some sort of business and looks around. There was sort
                    of the humiliation. It wasn't so much hers. She was looking down, askance at me,
                    but to me it was humiliating to be the son of a teacher and getting in trouble —
                    sort of like a pastor's child, I suppose. But in most respects she made sure
                    that she wasn't in a position of authority over me as a student. So that really
                    wasn't a problem. It was just a great asset to have someone for whom learning
                    was very important. As an example, I remember when I was in second grade, the
                    math teacher had the addition and subtraction tables on a big poster on the
                    wall, and somehow I learned early on what the answers were supposed to be as she
                    would go down the first line and the second line. But I just remembered what the
                    answers were and not how you got them. So, when she scrambled it or used cards
                    instead, I, of course, knew nothing. I still remember my mother being so shocked
                    that I had somehow failed to understand this. She got cards and drilled me at
                    home and so forth. So it basically was not acceptable not to learn in my
                    household. I think that the expectations were very high for both me and my
                    brother.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about the elementary level and we'll move to
                        the high school level. But elementary level, what about the Iowa school
                        system. How did you seem to find it at the time and in retrospect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: At the time, of course, it was the only school system that I knew, and
                    it was for me always a pleasure. I liked being a student. I think back on my
                    teachers, and I can't think of any of my teachers that I had a real problem with
                    as being a terrible teacher. I was fortunate in that respect. I can't be totally
                    objective about it now. I could think of a couple I think were really
                    exceptionally good teachers in elementary school. But my generalization about
                    Iowa is that it's a state which has always held education as being important.
                    Cynics might say it's because it's so boring there's nothing else to do. But for
                    whatever reason it's where the citizens support bond issues, where the teachers
                    are respected even if not paid in the top twentieth percentile or whatever. I
                    think that in general I benefited from my education all the way through, at a
                    fairly good public school even though it certainly could not hold up to those
                    offering Chinese. Only French was offered when I was growing up. I did have two
                    years of Latin in junior high, and that today sounds very exotic. But that was
                    just what one did at the time even if vaguely college bound.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then how about high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: High school was important to me in a number of ways. I think it was a
                    time when I really started to get an understanding and a real fascination with
                    foreign affairs. Of course for me the big foreign affairs issue was Vietnam. I
                    was an early reader of what was happening. Looking back on it I can't say that I
                    chose good sources. I was an early reader of Reader's Digest and U.S. News.
                    That's how I learned about the war. But, I remember, I was very impressed in
                    high school about Aba Eben. He seemed to me to be one of the greatest, most
                    eloquent public figures in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Foreign minister of Israel.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Right. It deceived me in a way because I became so knowledgeable in a
                    superficial way about what was happening Vietnam, where this or that military
                    unit was, and how many planes were shot down over the north. When I got into
                    college and started debating people because I basically thought this was the
                    patriotic thing. We were fighting a good cause to save South Vietnamese
                    democracy. My enlightenment on the issue actually was delayed because I seemed
                    to know more about the people on the other side of the issue among my
                    contemporaries. I can even think back on things that are very embarrassing to me
                    now doing a sermon at my church on how religiously appropriate it was to be in
                    Vietnam, sort of the Christian perspective on Vietnam — following the lead of
                    Billy Graham at the time. Jesus would've been a hawk or something like that
                    Billy Graham said. So that's how I would describe myself in high school, an
                    active teenage Republican, a supporter of Goldwater in '64, although I have to
                    say that even then I was an enthusiastic follower of Bill Scranton during his
                    last minute effort to provide an alternative to the conservative Goldwater. I
                    remember being in Des Moines, Scranton's first stop after announcing his
                    candidacy. But in most respects I would have been identified from the outside as
                    a fairly typical bright, college bound sort of Republican from small town Iowa.
                    That was pretty much my worldview.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In reading by the time you're in high school, were there
                        any particular books that you cared for or authors that you sort of
                        remember?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: As you ask the question, I don't remember what I was reading at the
                    time. I think that I was certainly reading both fiction and non-fiction, but I
                    really can't remember. I have memories of things like my English teacher in high
                    school getting us to read The Brothers Karamazov, and I think in retrospect I
                    was not ready for The Brothers Karamazov. I think in a lot of ways I was not
                    mature. I don't know if I was more or less mature than others my age. I mean,
                    when I think about my own daughter and her maturity level, her intellectual
                    maturity level in high school, I'm sort of astounded when thinking what I was
                    reading at the age she's now reading. It seems like she is two or three years at
                    least ahead of me as assignments go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did radio or TV or movies, were these good sources of the
                        things you were interested in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I'd say they were, and I paid careful attention to the commercial
                    news. I mean, Huntley and Brinkley were an important part of my maturation as a
                    consumer of news. I liked going to movies. I remember the movie The Graduate,
                    loomed very large.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dustin Hoffman. Classics.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Classics. It's the kind of movie that you saw several times and just
                    made an incredible impression on people in their mid teens at the time. Dr.
                    Zhivago was another movie that made a very large impact on me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dating, I mean, how did that work in those days? Did you,
                        did one go steady?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Not well. In those days some of my friends had steady girlfriends, but
                    in my high school, in my crowd, we were a mostly unsuccessful group of people
                    who were very much interested in girls but just hadn't quite gelled. So we would
                    spend a lot of time talking in theory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Welcome to the club.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: So in my understanding now there was a great blessing at the time to
                    be not particularly active dating girls because I had a very close friendship
                    with three other guys. We used to be four other guys but one of them started
                    dating regularly and kind of moved out of our circle. But we'd spend a lot of
                    time sort of driving around or watching thunderstorms or playing pool at one of
                    our friend's houses. I think the quality of that friendship when I talk to other
                    people about who they're in touch with or what they did, was a little unusual.
                    So I'm very grateful now that it came to me a little bit later.</p>

                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, that's I think very much the case. I don't think there was ever
                    any interest in any alternative.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I had a paper route when I was younger. This was, in my case, an
                    afternoon paper route. That's where I got my first experience earning money. But
                    then in high school I graduated to a job in a grocery store that was only a
                    block a way. That included operating the cash register, sacking groceries and
                    stocking shelves. I tend to think I learned most of my work ethic from that
                    experience. Fortunately I learned to do this in the Midwest where you learn the
                    customer is always right and a certain sense of service that I'm not sure is
                    matched on the East Coast.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any idea from your teachers or family and all

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: I had a vague sense from high school that I'd like to do something in
                    international affairs. In terms of schools, I look back and think that I was not
                    terribly ambitious in my thinking and very ignorant about what kind of choices
                    there were. I was fortunate in that my brother went to Grinnell College, which
                    is twenty miles down the road, a very good, small, private liberal arts school.
                    It's the best in Iowa, the best school Iowa had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a major, it has national renown.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, that's right and now they've got a huge endowment, which I'm not
                    sure they had at the time. But it was one of only three schools to which I
                    applied. The others were University of Iowa and Simpson College, all in Iowa.
                    None of them bad schools, but interesting to me that my ambitions did not extend
                    beyond living at the most eighty miles from my home. So ended up going to
                    Grinnell, and it was there that I really encountered the wider world since
                    Grinnell even at that time, the majority of students came from Chicago, new
                    York, Los Angeles, the large metropolitan areas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were at Grinnell from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: From 1968 to '72.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, could you describe, well, talk about the Vietnam
                        experience, feeling then, but first, how did you find Grinnell? I mean, what
                        was it like in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I'll try not to talk too long on this subject but—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh no. I find it interesting because when we're doing
                        this, we might as well be picking up social and educational history
                        too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Grinnell had always had a reputation for social activism. It was part
                    of the social gospel school of Protestants. It was founded by people who came
                    out of New England theological seminaries, and I think they saw it as part of
                    their mission to bring education to the wilderness. It was a school founded in
                    1846. Started out in Davenport on the Mississippi. They decided it was too much
                    wickedness and sin there—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: And pulled it farther away. But it was a school that was always ahead
                    of the social issues of the day; things that later became accepted were
                    certainly not accepted at the time. Some very learned professors were at the
                    school. So it had that kind of reputation. It was one of the first schools to
                    have a lot of women, coed education. One of the houses there was the oldest
                    women's residence dorm west of the Mississippi. They remembered things as the
                    oldest this and that. When I went there it was a time of course of great social
                    turmoil, 1968. Thinking back on it, my freshman year in 1968 was just
                    incredible. For one thing, when I started out as a freshman, they had a rule
                    that women could be in men's rooms for only three hours on Sunday. You always
                    had to keep the door open. By the end of that year, they had dropped all
                    visitation hours. It went through several transitions but toward that eventual
                    outcome. There was very early into my first semester an encounter between Blythe
                    Draper a representative of Playboy Magazine who for some reason was on campus
                    talking about his magazine. He encountered students that I think had been
                    organized by Students for a Democratic Society. Ten of them took off all their
                    clothes in front of him. In something that was might be questioned in terms of
                    the clarity of the message, they were protesting Playboy's exploitation of women
                    as sex objects. For small town Iowa this was a rather extraordinary development.
                    It was made worse from the perspective of most Iowans by the fact that there was
                    a photographer present who provided pictures of full frontal nudity to the
                    underground press at the time. So people in New York and everywhere were seeing
                    the naked students of Grinnell College in Iowa. This became a cause celebre in
                    the state as well with the state attorney general, a conservative Republican,
                    seizing the papers as pornography and trying to suppress publication. But others
                    were found to publish the paper. The attorney general's name was Richard Turner,
                    and I remember one of the next headlines of the newspaper, which is called the
                    Pterodactyl was “Pig Turner seizes Pterodactyl.” So that was their news story.
                    This gained a lot of notoriety.</p>
                <p>But at the same time all this was happening, I have this memory of the homecoming
                    celebration at Grinnell, a football game, that brought back a lot of alumni. The
                    halftime ceremony was the traditional time when the woman chosen by the football
                    team to be the homecoming queen was crowned. The crowning ceremony had begun
                    when all of a sudden out of the corner of the field came a convertible with
                    someone who I think was named Sid the Kid Melman from New York. He was gay and
                    he was the homecoming queen. He came out with I think a garland on his hair. He
                    was throwing kisses to the crowd and coming across the field with all these sort
                    of hippies in tow throwing flowers or whatever. This didn't go over well with
                    the alumni at the time. Nor did the raising of the Vietcong flag, an alternative
                    flag raising.</p>
                <p>So that was the kind of environment I had — great generational alienation. Most
                    of my friends and acquaintances at Grinnell seemed not to want to go back home
                    during break or at Thanksgiving or whatever. They seemed to be alienated from
                    their parents. I got along fine with my parents and certainly wanted to see them
                    often if for no other reason because home was the convenient place to do
                    laundry.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, absolutely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I think it went just beyond the laundry. I really enjoyed the company
                    of my parents and that seemed like a natural thing to do. So I had some culture
                    clashes myself and was sort of a dissenter from my early times as a member—. I
                    think I was treasurer of the college Republicans at the time and really only
                    about halfway through my college career when I more or less joined the
                    mainstream there in terms of opposing the war and actually changed parties at
                    the end of 1971. John Lindsay became a Democrat. I followed and ended up going
                    to the Iowa precinct caucuses voting for McGovern in 1972 in the middle of a
                    blizzard. So I went through a lot of changes during that time. I'm sure they
                    were very much brought about, not just by the students that I went to school
                    with and with whom I often disagreed on both political issues and cultural
                    issues, but as part of the whole process of opening my mind to thinking about
                    things in a different way and to the efforts of college professors to make me
                    think rigorously about questions and issues, which I think were mostly
                    successful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the faculty dealt with this because I
                        mean within this, you might say the anti-war, anti-establishment movement,
                        it always struck me — I'm considerably older so I was already into the
                        Foreign Service by that time. But they were young people who were trying on
                        their spurs as leading people and trying to get them to do things and it was
                        just sort of almost being against your parents, which is always great for
                        kids.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, how, did you find, and a lot of it is they
                        couldn't care less about education. Mainly it was to, it seemed to be a lot
                        was to disrupt and education was the place to be.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, well, there was that strong component I think of what was going
                    on. When I look back on it, I did not go to Vietnam, but I see myself as
                    profoundly a member of the Vietnam generation. It colored my four years of
                    college so much. I went to school with a lot of people who I think would not
                    have chosen to go to school at that point in their lives, but they had to to
                    postpone being drafted. It was a student body, which looking back was full of
                    fear. I mean, the males there, I think, all of us were worried at one level —
                    some level of our consciousness — about dying in Vietnam. That was where young
                    people were bound or so it seemed, and the war was just getting worse and worse,
                    higher and higher casualties, as I moved through most of my years of college. I
                    think that made apolitical students very political. It influenced their views
                    about the U.S. roles in the world that would've been entirely different if it
                    hadn't involved their own lives, and it was something that made alienation with
                    parents over things like hair length so much deeper. I mean, my first roommate
                    in college was someone who right before going to college had gone to
                    Woodstock.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A musical festival in New York.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '67, I think it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Which was a major cultural event. So or maybe it was even December of
                    '68 [ed note: August 15-18, 1969] because I think, just as I was getting to know
                    him, he was coming off of that experience — being part of that — which seemed
                    rather impressive to me that he could've actually been in the crowd. So the
                    whole thrust of the student body at Grinnell, which is clearly Iowa's most
                    radical institution, was a very important part of it. It was a school where
                    there was a hiding of wealth and privilege in one's family rather than a
                    flaunting of it. The uniform of the student was a work shirt and jeans, and
                    makeup was really verboten [forbidden]. Clothing was sort of deliberately almost
                    asexual. This was what I learned instead of the frat school kind of education
                    that seemed to be featured in other places. So it was in that environment in
                    which when I eventually came around on the war. I joined the march through Des
                    Moines to the state house to somehow get them to stop the war; which made no
                    sense, because in the process it alienated a lot of Iowans due to the obscene
                    shouting and everything. I learned some early lessons about what works and what
                    doesn't work. I remember a much more effective candlelight, silent walk through
                    Grinnell, Iowa, after the invasion of Cambodia which I thought at the time had a
                    much greater chance of winning converts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember the candlelight thing because I was consul
                        general in Saigon when a couple of American students who hitchhiked around
                        ended up in Saigon. They had their candles out, and they had a superfluity
                        of TV cameras around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the faculty handle this and then we'll talk about
                        what courses you were taking. But how did the faculty handle this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: I think they handled it very well because although there were a lot of
                    expectations of students to perform, there was also some leniency too in that
                    the faculty. This was a small college. The faculty knew students. They knew that
                    the students were actively involved in things and that it would probably be
                    better to be lenient in terms of deadlines and everything. That had been my
                    experience for the most part. The college shut down early in 1970 following Kent
                    State and Jackson State. It was really very much along the lines of the Ivy
                    League. A lot of our professors came out of the Ivy League. This was sort of the
                    proper reaction at the time to what was happening in the country. As a student
                    at that point, I felt differently. I felt a lot of money was being spent on my
                    education, there was much to get from my education that spring, and I was being
                    deprived of it by the school shutting down. So I was out there demonstrating
                    against shutting the college down when most of the students who had been very
                    emotionally and physically involved in protest activity were realizing that
                    deadlines on papers and tests loomed. They weren't ready for it. So they had a
                    personal stake in the shutdown and extended deadlines as well as their
                    ideological feelings about the war. I still have no apologies for my protesting
                    at the time and am sorry the college shut down early. But I'm not sure it was
                    the wrong decision because emotions were running very high. A lot of the
                    professors themselves, as mature and sophisticated as they were, were pretty
                    overwrought about what was happening and did things that were really
                    unparalleled for them in terms of their careers, feeling that the nation had to
                    adopt a different course on these issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there a gap between you might say the tenured
                        professors and the instructors?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes. There may have been at the time but, as a student, I didn't have
                    that level of sophistication. There was certainly divisions in the faculty.
                    There was a classics professor for example, who after the students turned the
                    American flag upside down in the international distress signal, staged an all
                    morning protest in which he hugged the flag and prevented any student from doing
                    that. That was one of the cases when faculty members clearly did not join in
                    what was happening on the campus. There were others, like a professor I had for
                    a course in Marxism at the school, who felt differently about it. There were
                    varying degrees of involvement. But it was not a uniform movement of faculty
                    encouraging what the students were doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you didn't, I take it, suffer the problems that
                        happened in some of the major universities when the students took over
                        buildings and trashed them and that sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: There wasn't much you could do at Grinnell, but there was a little bit
                    of that. There was an occupation of buildings over I think race issues, or
                    women's issues. Pretty radical and disturbing to a lot of the people on campus
                    to see offices seized. The only thing that really parallels though what was
                    happening in some other colleges is Grinnell had a very small Air Force ROTC
                    attachment. I was actually a member until I did not pass the physical that
                    would've allowed me to get a full Air Force scholarship to Grinnell College,
                    which was a lot of money at the time. It would've also have been a route for me
                    to have the kind of Vietnam service that I thought was inevitable after college
                    in a different way than like an infantry draftee would have. That small Air
                    Force ROTC operation or detachment operated out of a small building on the edge
                    of campus, which was then seized by the students in a march that had a lot of
                    really inflated rhetoric at the beginning like, you know, women and children
                    first. They won't shoot women and children. We ended up there at the — when I
                    say we, I think I was a witness but not a participant. They went to this
                    building, which was just a house with a porch on it and everything, and were met
                    by the chief of police in the town, who was very much like Andy Griffith. He was
                    all alone, sort of crossed his hands. “I'm afraid that if you go in here I'm
                    going to have to arrest you,” he said. So that was enough to stop this crowd. It
                    just kind of milled around and swarmed around the chief of police. Someone broke
                    a window. Because of the density of the crowd, Chief Peters couldn't really do
                    anything about, but even after they broke the window, got into the building and
                    seized it. They left money to pay for the broken glass afterwards, and it was
                    kind of comical in retrospect, but it was what the people in the school thought
                    appropriate given the national emergency. They succeeded in getting the ROTC off
                    campus. But the funny thing was, the Air Force which had been making an
                    exception every year for this very small detachment, just said, “we're removing
                    the exception.” It was like the Air Force said, “you can't fire us; we quit.”
                    They pulled out. That too was an occasion for me protesting that what are you
                    guys doing to the Air Force here. You don't want Grinnell College officers. You
                    want only Brigham Young University and the kind of officers that Lieutenant
                    Calley represents. So I thought then and I think still it was a mistake. What
                    they should have done was to maybe change the requirements for getting
                    commissioned as an Air Force officer. Maybe the Air Force shouldn't have been
                    teaching anything. But to just kick them off, I thought, was exactly the kind of
                    fuzzy-minded thinking my fellow students were famous for.</p>

                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes. That's a good way to put it.</p>

                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Well, I'm sure my mother in particular thought that this had been a
                    very big mistake to send us to a place where we would get all these crazy
                    notions. So she was pretty upset at a lot of the things that were happening and
                    at the bad influences on me as a student — on me and my brother. My brother was
                    actually also a student at Grinnell two years ahead of me. He became an Air
                    Force officer, but his commissioning ceremony had to be held three miles away
                    from town, at the outskirts protected from disruption by the Iowa Highway
                    Patrol. That was the kind of an atmosphere in 1970 when he graduated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you come home with long hair?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: My hair was never really long. It was over the ears kind of long, but
                    nothing that quite aroused the very hostile automatic reaction from a lot of
                    Iowans that shoulder length hair did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hair was terribly important. I remember talking in 1970 to
                        a brigadier general at one of the bases in Vietnam, Qui Nhon or something
                        like that. He said when he got there, they said, “Thank God you've come.
                        You've got to settle a dispute.” And he thought how am I going to deal with
                        the possible attack of the Vietcong on the base but it was where sideburns
                        could come on the soldiers' hair. I mean, this turned into quite a classic.
                        What about plain education? What were you getting? I mean what was your
                        subject? What were your interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: My major was political science, and I felt very fortunate for having a
                    good political science mentor. The professor Jim McGee who taught the
                    international affairs at Grinnell was I think someone who had a profound
                    understanding of how international affairs works. I really think I gained a lot
                    from that exposure. Some of my best education though was not only in my chosen
                    career field. I had a terrific humanities course, which was at the time required
                    of everyone. It was partly a writing class, but it was two semesters. One would
                    read the classics from Odyssey and the Iliad to Paradise Lost, a lot of thing
                    that I might not otherwise have read. It was a tremendous intellectual adventure
                    when I think back on it. My professor in this class, Emmett Foster, graded very
                    hard. My first semester grade was I think a C+. He gave hardly any A's, but it
                    was such an exciting intellectual environment. I mean, it was a real high just
                    to go through that class. They would normally switch to other professors at the
                    end of first semester. You take humanities from another professor. I transferred
                    into another class, and at first kind of realized that I could at least get a
                    decent grade in this other class. But then after only one class I thought, no,
                    I'm losing the tremendous education. So I went back to Emmett Foster's class.
                    There were a number of classes that I think even to this day, really helped me
                    to unfold my understanding of the way the world works. One on revolution and
                    revolutionaries was so useful to me throughout my career. When I look back, I
                    can think of a few courses I took at Grinnell that were kind of duds or just
                    very mediocre. But for the most part they were very educational experiences, and
                    they were taught by professors who really cared about their students and the way
                    they understood the subject.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, just, to capture the period, I've been disturbed by
                        how in the last decade or so international relations, basically political
                        science, I mean, so much a part of political science has been turned into
                        models.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Quantification.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Quantification, to my mind has sort of destroyed the
                        basis. I mean, and have absolutely no value for those of us who are
                        essentially practitioners. I may be wrong but how did you, it sounds like
                        you were there at a golden period when they were talking about the real
                        world.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Well, I really felt that, and I have had a little exposure in recent
                    years as a guest of other professors. I'm a political science major whose advice
                    would be to people who want to prepare themselves for a career in foreign
                    affairs is to become a history major because I too feel that political science
                    as a discipline has become so quantified and so oriented to applying the lessons
                    of electoral politics, where quantification has some utility, to a lot of
                    questions that really can't be quantified. Or else they can be quantified, but
                    it doesn't get to the heart of an understanding of the issue. So it adds some
                    peripheral understanding of something that's happened. So I'm not sure, I can't
                    say this as a faculty member or as a scholar. But I really don't think that I
                    would find a lot of the presentations at a political science convention to be
                    terribly interesting to me or terribly relevant to the world that I know about
                    as a practitioner. History is almost always relevant to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Well, it's basically the same essentially the same
                        study as political science except it's on a more personal level, I
                        think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: And once you don't try to over-generalize it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know. Well, as you were doing this, what about the world
                        beyond since we're talking about foreign affairs eventually. Did the world
                        intrude much outside of Vietnam? I mean, but that was almost a different
                        matter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, that was certainly the big intrusion that entered our personal
                    lives. But I mean other things happening in Europe with the NATO (North Atlantic
                    Treaty Organization) alliance and everything entered my focus as well. I guess
                    at the time environmental issues were starting to enter our consciousness as
                    being global issues worthy of study. But it really was, it really was dominated
                    by the Vietnam and even things that I learned at the time about Russia and China
                    and the tensions between Russia and China were more kind of through the
                    relevance of those issues to Vietnam. I mean, so obsessed was I and probably a
                    lot of my colleagues on what was happening in the war there. I do remember—this
                    is jumping ahead a little bit—but I remember in my oral exam in entering the
                    foreign service they asked me about which areas of the world that I thought that
                    I had some particular knowledge in. I identified Asia and Europe. Then they
                    asked me these questions about Latin America — Peruvian fishing rights — that I
                    didn't know much about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh dirty tricks.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: I also remember that Latin America was in my memory at the time in
                    looking at those jobs from the first that were available in my entering the
                    Foreign Service class, Latin America came in dead last on the list of places in
                    the world I would find interesting to go to. Of course that's where I went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you pointed towards something as you were
                        outside of hoping that the war would be over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I think in a way I was already pointing a little bit to my later
                    interest in political/military affairs and arms control, and I don't know
                    whether it was playing with toy soldiers as a boy or whatever. I think the
                    security issue did even then particularly really interest me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get much in the way of military history?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I would say no, not specifically and not even in graduate school. I
                    didn't really have a rigorous education in military history. To the extent that
                    I learned about it was just reading on my own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You find that interesting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I do now. I mean, it's hard to know which really came first what the
                    relationship is. My professional responsibilities, my private interest. But the
                    subject of war, how it is fought and how it is avoided is probably my most
                    consuming professional and personal interests.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you get involved in extracurricular
                        activities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Not to a major extent. I was not in athletics. In high school I was in
                    debate, a debate program. Looking back on high school that was also one of those
                    programs that had been a very big influence on me in terms of how one presents
                    information even things like learning to eliminate non-fluencies, uh and um and
                    those things, which I remember used to be part of my presentational style. But I
                    was told that this was undesirable and I deliberately chose to eliminate
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you graduated in '72, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: 1972.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you planning, what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Well, I had no military obligation, both because I did not pass the
                    ROTC physical, and also I got draft number 352 when they had the lottery. So I
                    was free of a military obligation and got what I most wanted at that point, I
                    was accepted by the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton coming out of Grinnell
                    College, which was a very happy development. They offered among other things a
                    full tuition scholarship package, and it was prestigious, and only one out of
                    ten applicants were accepted. So I was very happy about that. And also the
                    Woodrow Wilson School encouraged people to take time off if they so chose,
                    feeling that the graduate experience would be richer if people had real world
                    experience. So I did take a year off between undergraduate school and graduate
                    school and did a number of things. I worked as a park ranger in the summer. It
                    was my second, my third summer doing that, working at Crater Lake National Park
                    in Oregon. Then I went to work as a district field representative for then
                    Congressman John Culver in Iowa. That was in a lot of ways a campaign job. I
                    didn't quite realize at the time the problems with being paid by the government
                    for a campaign job. But that's really what it was. After that I went to Germany
                    to study at the Goethe institute for two months, February and March in the
                    winter. Then I traveled around Europe a little bit, came back, spent time with
                    my friends at Grinnell, just sort of hanging out, even typing papers for a
                    couple of friends in need. I guess then the following summer was my third summer
                    as a park ranger. The one before was the second summer. So I basically spent
                    that whole year in between doing different things in each quarter, and it was a
                    very good experience for me. It was just what I needed at the time — to take a
                    break and to recharge my batteries and get fired up for that graduate
                    school.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Germany was your first real foreign affairs experience, I
                        mean foreign experience.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes.</p>

                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: That was at a town called Ebersberg outside of Munich, and that was
                    the last station stop on one of the — I forget what we want to call it — one of
                    those mass transit systems out of Munich. It was for the most part a rural
                    Bavarian village but with fairly easy access to Munich. Most of the fellow
                    students there were Swiss from the French and Italian speaking parts and a few
                    other kinds of Europeans. It was a pretty good way to learn German, except that
                    my friends would usually speak Italian outside of class and that didn't do me
                    much good. But that was actually my second experience in Germany. Because my
                    first experience was going over in the summer as a nineteen-year-old to work in
                    a German grocery store for a month as a foreign worker at sixty-two cents an
                    hour and to meet my German aunts for the first time. I did a month working at
                    the store, spent some time with one of my elderly aunts, visited some of the
                    other people in Oldenburg, Germany who had gone to school with my father and
                    learning a little bit about his life from that perspective and then traveling
                    around Germany a bit. That was my first formative foreign experience. I flew on
                    Luxembourg, I mean Icelandic Airlines.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Icelandic.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Through Luxembourg in a Rolls-Royce turboprop forever across the
                    Atlantic. And had that teenage living in Europe experience that it seemed like
                    so many Americans had at the time of stand-by and relatively cheap flights to
                    Europe, which was another tremendous experience for seeing America from outside
                    and the different perspective, which I'm sure just increased my interest in
                    getting some kind of job that would allow me to do that professionally.</p>

                    school would basically find some kind of employment for the students during the
                    intervening summer. So I remember in my case I was going to be working as an
                    intern at our embassy in Kabul, Afghanistan. But then that kind of fell through
                    because Afghanistan was getting so dangerous some time before the summer came. I
                    can't remember whether Spike Dubs, the ambassador there, was assassinated in
                    Afghanistan.</p>

                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, it was after—</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was close to the Soviet invasion.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: It was after that summer, but I mean obviously the security situation
                    was such that they didn't want to have some intern to worry about. I remember
                    reading up on a favorite Afghan sport, which is to pass a calf carcass between
                    riders. So I was getting ready for that very exotic life, and then it was not
                    possible. I heard about this other opportunity working as an intern on the
                    policy planning staff at the State Department, which is an incredibly good job.
                    I'd really have to say as exotic as Afghanistan would've been that I could not
                    have had a better summer than being part of Winston Lord's policy planning staff
                    at a time when Kissinger was Secretary of State. That was one of those
                    occasional golden periods of policy planning when I found that perfect balance
                    between being actively involved in policy but still taking one step down the
                    road as regards implications.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: This was summer of '74.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well first how was Winston? Did you see, I mean at least
                        from a distance how he operates?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, at least from my perspective, which was only as an intern, but he
                    was very impressive. I'm sure in a lot of subconscious ways he was a role model
                    for me in terms of how to run an office. He was attentive and kind to
                    insignificant fellows such as myself. He was very temperate and calm in a very
                    high stress job. He would share with the staff an ounce of what he was finding
                    out in his conversations with Kissinger that made it exciting to be a part of
                    it. This was of course the time when Kissinger wasn't even telling his assistant
                    secretary a lot of things that were going on. But he was discrete. I'm sure he
                    didn't tell us things that Kissinger was trying to keep very close to the vest,
                    but you had a sense of involvement. There was an incredible collection of people
                    at the time on policy planning staff. I was assigned to Willard De Pree who
                    later became the ambassador to Africa, and he was doing internal budget work.
                    The policy planning staff was kind of involved in sitting in on the internal
                    budget process. There was Anton Duport who is still a personal friend today and
                    who was doing European issues. John Kornblum was kind of the in-house European
                    expert. There was Jerry Kahan who later on was a deputy assistant secretary of
                    state for whom I worked. He was, I think, working on Middle Eastern issues at
                    the time. Reggie Bartholomew came in toward the end of the summer. Tom Simon was
                    there on the policy planning staff. I'm sure I'm leaving someone off. Bill
                    Newbert who left at the end of the summer or the middle of the summer for
                    Leningrad to become a consul general there was one, as fate would have it, his
                    son moved in down the street from us in Arlington, Virginia. I am now the
                    godfather of his daughter and Joe Newbert's granddaughter. It's amazing to, it
                    was very funny as this realization unfolded. It wasn't immediate. But I kind of
                    remembered this picture that I treasure of Winston Lord at a farewell dinner at
                    the Foreign Service Club. On one side of Winston Lord was Joe Newbert going off
                    to Leningrad and the other side intern Greg Thielmann. This was a very heady and
                    special experience in my memory at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of things were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: I was basically an assistant to De Pree and helping him prepare budget
                    information and comments on the various bureaus' spending plans. But it was one
                    of those jobs where I was also the go-fer and had access to various other
                    members of the policy planning staff. Many of them enjoyed talking to the
                    interns. I would learn from them. Richard Finn was the guy responsible for East
                    Asian affairs. I had respect for his understanding of issues too, but one of the
                    things that became pretty obvious was that there wasn't going to be any kind of
                    free and open thinking about Vietnam. This is something that Kissinger was
                    controlling tightly. He didn't need much help in the grand scheme of things. In
                    the summer because I was still sort of obsessed with Vietnam, I would pay
                    attention to the things crossing my desk — cables from Saigon, hearings by
                    Graham Martin coming back and talking about the future budget needs of the
                    embassy. I had this sense that so much of the information here was an unreal
                    world. It didn't seem to me to correspond with what I was reading about, what
                    was happening in Vietnam. For example, Graham Martin and was it Lehman, his
                    deputy — they were testifying to the Congress about how the aging leaders of
                    North Vietnam had lost touch with reality. That they presented budgets in which
                    the war costs were basically winding down because we were winning, and it was
                    sort of the last gasp of the Communists in North Vietnam as long as we
                    persevered and didn't cut and run. Well, even from the stuff I was seeing, it
                    seemed to me like things were getting pretty tough in the northern part of South
                    Vietnam. The North Vietnamese regulars were pouring in. They seemed to be
                    building airbases and everything inside South Vietnam. So in leaving that summer
                    it seemed to me that someone needed to say that. I talked to Finn about it. I
                    learned very quickly that this was really not something that would be welcomed.
                    To point out these things would not be welcomed. It was almost “like yeah, of
                    course, that's true, but what can you do with that information.” Well, I had
                    nothing to lose so as an intern, I wrote an article in the Open Forum Magazine
                    to say that there seemed to be some delusional thinking going on in the
                    Department of State on this issue. Well, it was my good fortune in terms of
                    [corridor] reputation and our national bad fortune that the North Vietnamese
                    offensive occurred in March. This article appeared in October. So I looked very
                    precocious at the time even though I was just really reflecting in Open Forum
                    Magazine what was pretty obvious to a lot of people. Of course I didn't have
                    access to it or I couldn't print a copy of it publicly since it was a still
                    classified secret. But some years later I finally got a hold of it by going
                    through the Freedom of Information Act. It seems pretty good reading even to
                    this day for talking about what was actually happening at the time and showing
                    that what the U.S. government was saying to the Congress did not represent what
                    was happening at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What it would be very interesting to do is when you get
                        the chance to edit this transcript, why don't you insert this thing in
                        there. Back to Woodrow Wilson. When you weren't dealing in the upper reaches
                        of diplomacy, what courses were you taking? How did you find the school
                        itself?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Oh, when I wasn't in the upper reaches, I was down in the depths of
                    struggling through statistics and microeconomics, something that made me feel
                    pretty stupid. The school rather deliberately thought what students really
                    needed there was not the kinds of things that I would be most interested in
                    studying, history and international affairs. But they had a lot of requirements
                    on quantitative analysis and economic theory and application, which indeed did
                    fill some of the gaps in my own education. But a lot of this was hard stuff. I
                    had this epiphany about half way through my economics class that one of the
                    reasons why I wasn't understanding what was being said was because I had no
                    calculus in either high school or college and they were presenting calculus. It
                    was that part of the training I thought was not well crafted to appeal to
                    non-specialists or people not interested in econometrics because it was people
                    who were very interested in the econometrics side of it that were the ones
                    giving the lectures for the most part. So I had a tough time in some of the
                    courses there and a frustration that some of the things I would be most
                    interested in studying like Richard Ullman's classes in international affairs
                    were not available. I had a great one my second semester, but the next year he
                    went off to the Foreign Affairs Council of New York, and he wasn't available for
                    classes.</p>
                <p>So I had kind of a spotty report on the quality of the teaching. Richard Falk who
                    was one of the most well known people on international law among scholars was I
                    thought not very good at all as a lecturer. He spoke very slowly and it probably
                    looked great as a transcript. But it was not very riveting to listen to, and he
                    was not particularly interested in what everyone who is a foreign affairs
                    practitioner needs to know about international law. I took his international law
                    course at Princeton, but I still feel there is that gap in my understanding of
                    the basics of international law, which the Foreign Service never bothered to
                    teach either. So I really give only a say a C grade to the quality of
                    Princeton's instruction and how it suited my later needs. But I would give an A
                    to the quality of the experience with the other students there. I mean, I
                    learned a great deal from this group of very accomplished and bright graduate
                    students, most of whom went into either domestic affairs, the World Bank or
                    international economics. I was one of only four people of that fifty who went
                    into graduate studies in international affairs. It was kind of a waning
                    interest. This public affairs school for international affairs didn't seem to
                    draw people into the Foreign Service anymore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was also a period too when there was a real turning
                        away from government service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: That's right. That's right.</p>

                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: That's right. That's right. You could earn a fortune and real power in
                    something other than the foreign service. That was an exception at the time. It
                    was sort of one of those has-been career pursuits.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you got to, so we get you out in seventy—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: '75.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Well, in '75 I had passed the foreign service exam. I actually took it
                    twice. The first time was as a senior in college and I did not pass it. I passed
                    the written, but did not pass the oral. It was suggested to me at the time that
                    I should really try the consular cone. They said consular administrator would be
                    easier, and I said, “No, I'm really interested in the political cone.” He said,
                    “Well, try again. Maybe in graduate school,” and at that time I did pass, both
                    the written and oral. So I had passed it. I guess it was winter at that time,
                    but there was still the physical and background investigations. I was told that
                    they were running nine months behind in background investigations. So there
                    wouldn't be any job offer or invitation to enter foreign service when I
                    graduated from Princeton. So I had to have a job, and it was through Princeton
                    connections that I found out the Office of Management and Budget was hiring, for
                    the international security division. So I got a job that actually turned out to
                    be a very good job as a budget examiner for naval research and development,
                    which was a four billion-dollar line item, bigger than the entire State
                    Department budget. That allowed me even as a young budget examiner to get very
                    good treatment visiting the naval research and development establishment and
                    even getting some tours of operational activities like P-3 patrols over the
                    Atlantic and carrier landings off South Carolina. So for the next two years I
                    worked as a budget examiner and learned a great deal about the budget process
                    and defense activities in particular. I retained my interest in the Foreign
                    Service though. When I had initially turned down the offer, which I had got I
                    guess a few months after entering the OMB, they certainly made clear that this
                    might be the last chance that I would get to enter the Foreign Service. I
                    thought I cannot in good conscience leave this job. It wouldn't be fair to the
                    people that hired me at this point. But I certainly was interested if sometime
                    before my eligibility expires, which I think was thirty months, I could be asked
                    again. Of course they made no promises, but in fact they did ask me again. So
                    after having work at OMB for two years and reached the frustrations that I think
                    come to budget examiners who realize that the main function of OMB is to suggest
                    budget cuts and not to necessarily suggest better ways to spend money or
                    differing programs emphases. I also realized that, unlike some other areas of
                    OMB, the national security division has relatively less influence because no one
                    wants to let those green eyeshade folks affect our national security. It doesn't
                    matter if they inspect our foreign affairs, but somehow national security is
                    exempt. So I felt some of those frustrations and felt that I would like to enter
                    the Foreign Service, which I then did in March of '77.</p>

                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes. I certainly remember and I think this was the one that I passed.
                    I got a question about naming my favorite American artists and authors. This was
                    one of the last questions I got, and I remember my mind going completely blank.
                    I could not think of any names whatsoever. I think the only name I came up with
                    was Jackson Pollack whose work I don't particularly even like. But it was
                    incredible. I don't know if I came up with F. Scott Fitzgerald or whatever who I
                    really did like at the time or not. But apparently they had already made up
                    their minds about me before that last throw away question. It certainly left me

                <p>THIELMANN: I would have to look up to remind myself about the numbers in the
                    course. I perceived it as a group of very interesting people who were quite
                    capable. There were a fair number of women in it. It was I think the foreign
                    service was already trying to get over its reputation as just being a white male
                    bastion. One of the things that I had a distinct impression of was there were
                    certain members of the class that impressed me early on for being very capable.
                    This was sort of in a group all of whom or nearly all of whom impressed me as
                    being capable, but there were some who stood out. It's very interesting how well
                    those early impressions correlated with the success some of these people have
                    had in the foreign service. I mean, if I had been asked which one of these
                    people is really going to go far, I would've said Alexander Vershbow, now our
                    ambassador to Moscow, Richard Boucher, the press department spokesman; someone
                    like Bill Woods, I'm not sure what his current position is. There are a couple
                    in the Foreign Service. But there were others obviously who were capable who are
                    no longer in and have gone other directions. But it was a pretty good bonding
                    experience. The difference for me was I had been living in Washington, actually
                    working at the Office of Management and Budget for the two previous years. In a
                    way that left me a little bit outside the mainstream because most people were
                    coming to Washington from elsewhere and many of them had just interrupted either
                    their studies or their career elsewhere and they had more time together in the
                    evening. I sort of had an established life and my own circle of friends. So in a
                    way I wasn't able to take advantage of that unique bonding experience in the
                    same way as later in my career I took advantage of the mid-level professional
                    development class when I was in more or less a similar kind of boat as everyone
                    else in the class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Greg, were you hired for a particular cone or specialty or
                        was it general?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: When I entered, they were still hiring people by cone. In fact I had
                    taken the exam twice, and passed the written both times. The first time I did
                    not pass the oral. This was right after college or I guess during my senior year
                    of college. I remember at the time being encouraged to try one of the other
                    cones other than political that were a little less competitive. I had decided at
                    that time, that no, I really wanted the kind of work that the political cone
                    offered. So I took it again when I was in graduate school and that time did
                    pass. I entered as a political officer. In those days the expectation from early
                    on was you would have one consular tour, and then the rest would fall into your
                    own cone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any particular area before they came around
                        and assigned you? Did you have any drive towards a particular area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I would say that the area I felt pulled to most strongly was Germany
                    partly because I had some German language and a particular interest in the
                    country and culture and had spent a summer there. If there was anything that in
                    my immature mind seemed logical for the Foreign Service, it was to send me to
                    Germany or some place in Europe. Of course that's not an unusual position for
                    entering Foreign Service officers to think they know what's good. As it
                    happened, I think I remember the feeling that the continent where I was
                    eventually sent, South America, interested me less than any other continent of
                    the world. I mean, if you would have asked me to rank Europe and Asia and Africa
                    and South America, South America would've clearly been at the bottom. It was a
                    little bit different though when we were shown the list of jobs, which were
                    obviously not the cream of Foreign Service offerings but something else. For
                    someone interested in the political cone the attraction of a job that was
                    labeled as rotational was very compelling, and Bras�lia was one of those jobs
                    that offered one year political and one year consular. So I think that ended up
                    being my second choice. My first choice was Frankfurt, Germany, and looking back
                    now I'm very grateful for having that opportunity to get to know Brazil. I
                    returned there later for another tour, my last foreign tour. It was a very
                    meaningful experience. Professionally, the fact that I was, my first year in the
                    Foreign Service the consular section chief in an embassy that had a small
                    consular function meant that I had an opportunity to do basically all aspects of
                    consular work except for immigrant visa processing and had the responsibility
                    for attending the country team representing the consular section and for going
                    to the foreign ministry frequently on consular issues. So it was a very rich
                    kind of consular experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you were assigned to Brazil, Bras�lia. You were
                        there from nineteen-when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: This would've been 1977 to '79. Ended up being a little short of two
                    years because of the language requirement.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What, talk about Bras�lia at the time, what was it
                        like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I can make some comparisons because I served there again from 1995 to
                    1998. Bras�lia at the time even though the city had been in existence at that
                    point I guess nearly twenty years. The city was basically built in three years,
                    a city of a million people. When I arrived there, there was still a lot of the
                    planned city that was unbuilt. I mean, you had an architectural design that was
                    sort of in the shape of a bird or a plane or whatever. One of the wings had
                    clearly not yet been filled out. Even the older wings and the superblocks as
                    they were called still had a lot of red earth with just sort of scrub on it
                    rather than manicured grass, that I found during my later tour. There was a much
                    more powerful sense of isolation there than later also. Bras�lia being deep
                    inland, 900 miles from the coast, a two-day drive to Rio, a day drive to Belo
                    Horizonte, really quite a long way from any competing center and really
                    surrounded by not quite empty savanna but very sparsely populated savanna that
                    for the most part looked like there was no livestock, no cultivation, nothing.
                    So added to that was the fact that the electronic age hadn't arrived. It was
                    clearly where you get island fever and, in fact the post at the time had an
                    isolation differential in acknowledgement of that situation. Bras�lia has always
                    and continues to be a unique Brazilian city because so many of the things that
                    one associates with other Brazilian cities don't take place there. You have much
                    less density in terms of the population. The privileged and the wealthy want to
                    live right in the heart of the city, and the suburbs are for poor people.
                    Bras�lia was almost on the American model. The nice apartments in the city were
                    where Brazilians, I think, instinctively wanted to be. It turned out that they
                    were a lot of developments like American suburbs on the other side of the lake,
                    which increasingly would attract people. There everyone could have their own
                    swimming pool and their own yard and a relatively short drive to work, and it
                    took on an American city kind of flavor, much more than one would associate with
                    Bras�lia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I realize you were at the bottom of the feed line, but
                        where, what, how were relations with Brazil at that time in '77 to '79?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Relations were bad. I'm not sure this would be described as the low
                    point in the relationship. But it was at least a close competitor for whatever
                    the low point was. The ambassador was named Crimmins.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John Hugh Crimmins?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: I was lowly enough that he was just Ambassador Crimmins to me. But my
                    understanding was that he had nearly been PNGed shortly before I arrived. We did
                    not have a long overlap. It was I think just a few months after my arrival that
                    he left. But he had a very serious dustup with the Brazilian government,
                    actually over the fate of a particular American missionary who had been sort of
                    kidnapped by Brazilian security officials and was probably on his way to being
                    killed. Crimmins was very persistent in asking the Brazilian authorities who
                    first said they had no information. But eventually his persistence resulted in
                    his release, and his persistence and some of the comments he made about the
                    Brazilian government were not appreciated by them. This was during a period when
                    Brazil was still under a military dictatorship.</p>
                <p>Added to that was the fact that in 1977 with the Carter administration, there was
                    much more of a focus on human rights and nonproliferation in U.S. policy. That
                    was like a one-two punch to the bilateral relationship with this particular
                    military dictatorship because Brazil had a missile program and a nuclear weapons
                    program at the time. It had an oppressive military government albeit less so
                    than Argentina and Chile. So, as the Brazilians were very quick to notice, Vice
                    President Mondale's first international trip was to Germany. One of the most
                    important items on his agenda was to talk the Germans out of selling nuclear
                    reactor technology to the Brazilians because of our concern about how it could
                    be used. Then with Carter's very visible pro-human rights profile, the
                    Brazilians, I think appropriately, saw themselves as one of the targets of his
                    policies. With those two overwhelming burdens on the bilateral relationship, I
                    thought it was basically a good thing, an appropriate thing for the U.S. I saw
                    Brazilian relations with the U.S. in some respects as in kind of a downward
                    tailspin at the time I arrived and probably during much of my tour. I remember
                    things like the newly appointed head of human rights at the State Department Pat
                    Derian going to Brazil and seeing rolling eyes everywhere about how are we going
                    to seat people at a meeting or at a dinner for this guest. It was like a pariah.
                    No, it was a combination of this sort of Latin American machismo about what's a
                    woman doing in a foreign affairs position. Then charged with the subject the
                    Brazilians didn't want to talk about at all. To me that was kind of one of the
                    most dramatic memories about how difficult U.S.-Brazilian relations were.</p>
                <p>Then on the nuclear front in fact on both of these issues, I think the U.S. was
                    on the side of history. During my second tour there it was very dramatic to see
                    for example former President Jimmy Carter coming back to Bras�lia, sitting
                    around a table with NGOs and having the Brazilians recall how some of them were
                    in prison at the time and how important for them and their cause it was to have
                    the American president taking this position. So we were definitely benefiting in
                    the 1990s from the positions the U.S. had at the time. My second tour in Brazil
                    was in one of the best possible periods of the U.S.-Brazilian relationship. So
                    it's really going from the nadir to the peaks to look at those two tours.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'll come back to some other things. But while we're on
                        this subject, did you find that the “chief” — I use the word in quotes
                        because you were it of the consular section, you did sit in the country
                        team. Did you sense almost resistance in particularly the human rights
                        policy and all? I mean saying well, it's all very well, but we've got other
                        things to do, and this is screwing up our way of getting this deal or that
                        deal or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I think it was early enough in the introduction or let's say raising
                    the profile of human rights issues that I had the impression as a young officer
                    that it was almost instinctive by career officers saying human rights is kind of
                    unseemly to bring into conversations here. It's unpleasant. It will have
                    immediately negative consequences, and my own feeling is that a lot of the
                    career foreign service officers were still in a state of shock about engaging in
                    a different way of doing business. What I would say sympathetically to them is,
                    of course they had an acute appreciation of how a concern about human rights can
                    very easily turn into an arrogant position of “we are better than you,” we know
                    how you should behave. This is particularly the case when policies are
                    controlled by political types who maybe don't have a very sophisticated view of
                    the world. I'm not necessarily putting Carter in that position, but we've
                    certainly seen a number of others in that position. I think it didn't take the
                    Foreign Service long — I would really date it from Carter — to see the
                    advantages of having a human rights report and seeing the long term advantages
                    of being perceived by populations, even if not by governments, as being on the
                    side of human rights. So I saw a lot of evidence of resistance when I entered
                    the Foreign Service, but within a relatively short period of time, I think even
                    some of those veteran officers changed their own views about how a properly
                    administered concern about human rights could work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Here you are, a brand new officer. Were you married by the
                        way at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: I was single and I must say that, well Bras�lia had a reputation at
                    the timthat if you came to Brazil single, you would leave married. If you came
                    married, you would leave divorced. In my case it didn't quite apply. I came
                    single and left single. But I did during the course of my two years meet my
                    future wife who was a Peace Corps volunteer. I met her in the Miami airport, and
                    my second year in Bras�lia was a period of getting to know her. So in some sense
                    at least the beginning of the marriage occurred in Bras�lia. Bras�lia, it was a
                    heady thing to be a single American diplomat in Bras�lia at that time because in
                    the Brazilian culture, and probably we could say the Latin American culture, one
                    had sort of a double boost to one's personal stature. If you were an American
                    diplomat, you were representative of an extremely powerful country, and so you
                    had that personal power. You were also presumed to be rich partly because, well,
                    because, objectively speaking, you were much richer than the average Brazilian.
                    There was also a little bit of misunderstanding. The Brazilians would assume
                    that the American Foreign Service was like the Brazilian foreign service, and
                    their foreign service really was elite and the upper crust in terms of money in
                    the society. So there was a little bit of misunderstanding. The end result of
                    all that was that, well, let's say it was easier to get the local women
                    interested in the single man than might be the case in the United States if you
                    were a Foreign Service officer. So that was a nice experience for me. I guess I
                    can say it that way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, tell me about your initial experience when you came.
                        How were you received, introduced into your first post? You alluded to this
                        off mike.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes. I was met by two junior officers, one whom was the head of the
                    consular section that I was going to be in. I was going to be replacing a young
                    political officer who was working in the area into which I would rotate. So I
                    experienced the shock of this very different kind of environment basically in
                    the hands of two people who seemed to understand Bras�lia quite well. For junior
                    officers they seemed to have both gotten a feel for the city. Both men spoke
                    good Portuguese. One had a Brazilian girlfriend, and both of them seemed to have
                    good contacts. But I have to report that, before the end of my first year, both
                    of them had been invited to leave the Foreign Service because of alleged
                    improper use of commissary items and drug transactions with the locals. Now
                    without commenting on the guilt or innocence here, I would just say that I
                    thought it was really unfortunate for one of the two officers who was let's say
                    influenced by the other to do certain things that I don't think he should've
                    been held responsible for. The Foreign Service lost a very good political
                    analyst in talking both of them into resignation as an alternative to
                    prosecution.</p>

                        whether—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I would really say no. I now can compare it with other posts, and I
                    would say this embassy was from the top down an honest, ethical operation.
                    Brazilian society certainly has plenty of corruption, but the Brazilian
                    employees of the embassy for example were honest as far as I could determine.
                    Even some of those who had worked closely with one of these American officers
                    were themselves not corrupt. I know from personal experience. So there should
                    not have been a negative reflection on the whole post. In fact, the regional
                    security officer was basically doing a good job rooting out the corruption that
                    did exist, which unfortunately involved some of the people that I relied on most
                    closely. Looking back on it again I thought that the regional security officer
                    had even given kind of the ringleader sufficient warnings that he could've
                    reformed himself if he had been inclined to do so.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about your work first as a consular officer.
                        What sort of things did you have to deal with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: At that time Brazil had a requirement for anyone who wanted to travel
                    to the United States had to pay for the right to do so. So there was a very
                    large exit fee requirement, which made our job in the consular section much
                    easier because it basically meant that a lot of the huddled masses yearning to
                    breathe free would not be able to come up with the money that would get them in
                    the door for a Brazilian exit visa. There was still, it was still a difficult
                    situation, and I don't think I ever really had a flair for doing what
                    non-immigrant visa officers need to do — to read people in terms of whether
                    they're being sincere or not, to decipher the forms and ask the appropriate
                    questions. I don't think I was really good at it. We did have very good
                    nationals working there, and that made it a little easier for me. But a big part
                    of the job was the non-immigrant visa function, and we would at the time, and I
                    suppose it's still the case, get these reports later from the Immigration
                    Naturalization Service.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Adjusting the status of those who had sworn to you, the consular
                    officer, that they only wanted to visit Disney World and then come back. Over
                    time that helps one develop a more cynical attitude toward the veracity of those
                    appearing before a visa officer. But I felt at the time completely snowed under
                    in terms of the requirements of the job. It was an awful lot for one person to
                    do and even more so because I didn't have the experience to draw on. A lot of
                    times I just didn't even know what one was supposed to do or what the law
                    required. I would have to consult with either my immediate supervisor, who
                    happened to be the DCM of a large embassy or a consular officers in Rio, and I
                    did that. They were very good at helping me with some of these issues. But I
                    worked very long hours and had considerable stress and then intermixed with that
                    of course were the occasional American citizen services cases. These included
                    the death of the public affairs officer of a heart attack when I was there. I
                    was the one who had to identify the body and take care of that. An American
                    businessman died on landing in Bras�lia and in those days there was only one
                    Brazilian in the whole city who could embalm. Brazil had a twenty-four hour
                    burial requirement, which put one under a great deal of stress regarding
                    notifying relatives in the United States to pay money quickly if they wanted to
                    see the body of their loved one again. These occasional pressures included
                    aiding some Americans who had been arrested on drug charges in some pretty
                    remote parts of the consular district. Bras�lia at the time had this enormous
                    consular district, which I think spanned a territory almost the size of the U.S.
                    between the Mississippi River and the Atlantic Ocean. At that time too for a
                    brief golden period, the U.S. pledged to ensure one month consular visits for
                    any American in captivity to make sure that they had adequate nutrition and that
                    kind of thing. In my case this involved some trips to pretty remote parts of the
                    country. Handling the American citizen services and dealings with the Brazilian
                    government on top of that relentless immigrant visa work was a lot for an
                    inexperienced first tour officer. I guess it was character building.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were prison conditions for the Americans under
                        arrest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: They were a lot better than for arrested Brazilians. I mean, they
                    really had separate facilities and better treatment just because they were
                    people who could create problems for the jailers. But they weren't good
                    conditions in terms of cleanliness or humane treatment. But at least in the few
                    cases that I had involvement with it was much less depressing than something
                    that would result in a threat to life, limb or health of the prisoner.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Brazilian authorities, the police
                        authorities and all. With the military government they tend to be pretty
                        severe. I mean, did you find that with our poor relations with the country
                        affected any of your work at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: I think it would be fair to say yes. But it was almost like some of
                    the people I had to deal with were either so far down in the hierarchy and so
                    dazzled by dealing with a consular officer that people would call you colonel as
                    sort of an honorary title. So it wasn't that I didn't get respect for my office
                    from people like that. At higher levels where there would be more national pride
                    resistance to being pushed around by the Americans it would be a slightly
                    different issue. But it wasn't so bad in my area, and for those people you had
                    regular dealings with like the head of the airport police and that kind of
                    thing, relations were fine. I mean, it was mutually beneficial for us to get
                    along.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much of an American-connected missionary
                        community in your consular district?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: There was indeed, and that was one of my most severe problems at the
                    time because some of those missionaries were part of the Wickliffe Bible
                    Society. They were bringing literacy to some of the most remote Indians, in many
                    from cases tribes that were just being discovered. Brazilians were very jealous
                    and concerned about these foreigners introducing civilization, if you want to
                    use that term, to natives of their country. The Brazilians did not want the
                    natives to learn their own language, to learn how to read and write in their own
                    language. They wanted them to learn Portuguese and that as the only written
                    language. So the whole Wickliffe thrust was interpreted as being hostile by the
                    Brazilian government. This wasn't always the case, but it became more and more
                    so. The Wickliffe Bible translators were having a terrible time getting visas
                    renewed, and I had a constant flow of problems like that. Aside from making
                    complaints, I didn't feel like I was really helping much other than providing a
                    sympathetic ear and taking the complaints to the Brazilians. It was almost like
                    the issue was much bigger than any individuals could deal with.</p>
                <p>Some of these missionaries would provide very valuable air services and medical
                    care and shipments to indigenous people in Brazil, and oftentimes much more
                    effectively than local Brazilian organizations. But even that was not something
                    that Brazilians appreciated necessarily. They more often felt threatened by it.
                    Then there was always fear and suspicion that somehow these missionaries were
                    working for the CIA. Nothing could have been more ludicrous if you know the CIA
                    and know these missionaries. The missionaries were very impressive people, very
                    dedicated, good people, people with whom I may have shared little in terms of
                    theology but very pleasant people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did you find that the missionary groups — one
                        sometimes think about American missionaries as coming sort of out of the
                        Midwest with no feel for culture or anything else. Did you feel, and all of
                        a sudden being in a place where culture is so important and I mean, the
                        disturbance — were they aware of the problems of bringing these people
                        out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: I think many of them were very sophisticated actually in
                    understanding. They knew what the problem was. They did their best not to
                    undermine Brazilian government authority in any way. They really were an
                    apolitical bunch for the most part. Their mission was in the spiritual realm and
                    to allow the natives to read the Bible in a way that they would be able to
                    appreciate it and not really concerned about lobbying in a political way for an
                    agenda other than what the Brazilian government wanted. So the problem really
                    was not there. In some ways though they were obviously trying to introduce a
                    foreign value system into native culture. On the other hand, they seemed to have
                    a great appreciation for the unique culture of the various tribes. They were
                    also very fluent in Portuguese. So they had respect for the Brazilians' language
                    and government functions and everything. I don't think their attitudes were part
                    of the problem.</p>

                        going on and was this a concern for the embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: It was clearly going on and, of course, continuing during my later
                    tour there. But it didn't directly impact on my particular job. There were
                    science attach�s in the embassy who particularly during my second tour I
                    remember as being the hosts and cultural and linguistic interpreters for a huge
                    number of NGOs and other American organizations concerned about what was
                    happening in the Amazon. This of course extended not just to the science attach�
                    but to the agricultural section and the economic section and many others. I
                    think all of us in one way or another were impacted by the foreign concerns
                    about what was happening ecologically in Brazil, and, of course, those American
                    reactions played back into the Brazilian paranoia about U.S. intentions. I mean,
                    there were a lot of serious people in Brazil who thought the U.S. was just
                    looking for an opportunity to militarily occupy the Amazon.</p>

                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: From the Brazilian perspective you can understand the logic train
                    because you would have American spokesmen including some from the government
                    talking about the Amazon as the lungs of the planet and how U.S. and
                    international survival was dependent on what happened in Brazil. You add that to
                    the thrust of America defending its national interests overseas with our own
                    troops, and you kind of put two and two together. It would even come back in
                    funny ways to see connections. On my second tour I was talking to a Brazilian
                    admiral during a U.S. fleet visit in Recife, I think it was, he mentioned to me
                    a U.S. plan to invade Brazil in 1941, and I thought, oh these Brazilians ...
                    these paranoid people are now kind of trying to reinvent history. Then shortly
                    after that there was an article in the proceedings of the U.S. Naval Institute
                    that outlined in some detail plans to land a marine division on the northeast
                    coast of Brazil. They were only aborted in a fairly mature phase when the
                    Brazilian government negotiated the rights to use Natal in World War II as a
                    jumping off point for Africa. So, if the U.S. was willing to invade Brazil in
                    World War II, then the Brazilians figure what has changed since then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one of the things, we were talking about was your
                        impression of Brazilian society. These Brazilians have always placed great
                        emphasis on the fact that they were a multi-racial society and all. But I
                        would think from what I understand about Brazil, is that you would find
                        Bras�lia would have very few people who could trace themselves back to
                        African descent. I would think they would be more concentrated in the more
                        popular cities on the coast or in S�o Paolo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I would say yes and no to that. The Brazilian elite, the government
                    bureaucrats in Bras�lia, were, lets say, lighter skinned than maybe the average
                    Brazilian, whatever that means. Afro-Brazilians would be found most heavily in
                    [Bahia?] and some of the coastal areas. But there really is, in so many respects
                    and much more than in some of the other countries of Latin America, a sort of a
                    new Brazilian, I think they almost all have African, Indian and European blood
                    in them. So it's just a case of different degrees. In the case of Bras�lia
                    specifically so much of the work there in building the city was done by people
                    from the northeast of Brazil who tended to be darker skinned, smaller in
                    stature, and have more Indian blood. So in Bras�lia, you would see the full
                    range of Brazilian nationalities. But Brazilian attitudes to race, I mean, are
                    strikingly different from U.S. attitudes. It's tempting to say that Brazilians
                    were not racist and the Americans were racist, and the Brazilians would point to
                    things like the oddities of the single drop theory of race in the U.S. If you
                    have a single drop of African blood, then you're an African American. But
                    somehow it doesn't work in the other direction. If an African American has a
                    single drop of white blood, they're African American. The Brazilians would find
                    that very odd and particularly in relation to the sexes. But in class terms it
                    is very much taboo. That is, a Brazilian sort of European woman or a higher
                    class woman, it would be a complete scandal if she were accompanied by a darker
                    skinned man or if she had an affair with a darker skinned man. Here in the
                    traditional attitudes about fidelity are limited to women and not to men. No
                    eyebrows are raised at all about a light skinned Brazilian man having a
                    dark-skinned companion.</p>

                <p>THIELMANN: Yes. Yes. I have seen Brazil's particular attitude toward race
                    described as colorism, and that certainly jives well with my own personal
                    experience. There is a presumption that the lighter the skin, the higher the
                    class. In Brazil like in a lot of countries, when you cross class lines, you can
                    create problems. But having said all that, there's a wide range of behavior
                    between races in Brazil that you just would not see in the United States. So in
                    general I agree with the generalization that Brazil is much less racist than the
                    United States, and Brazilians value as a national asset the mixing of bloods.
                    That is part of the pride in Brazilian identity. We are a three race nation and
                    proud of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what did you do in the political section in your
                        last year there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I was special assistant to Ambassador Robert Sayre, and then I had
                    other responsibilities that are not uncommon for junior officers, like being
                    protocol officer and bio officer, but it was pretty low level stuff for
                    political section work. That is I didn't really work on an important piece of
                    political section activity. We had kind of an interesting crew of people at the
                    time. It was a very odd position to be in in terms of being the staff assistant
                    to the ambassador because I was in the political section, kind of around the
                    corner from the ambassador. I had to overcome the normal difficulties with the
                    ambassador's secretary since she perceived job overlaps in my responsibilities.
                    The ambassador himself, Robert Sayre, I would say, had a somewhat introverted
                    personality, and so, it took me a while to adjust to his style. At the same time
                    it had not been made clear to me who my immediate supervisor was. I mean, who
                    was actually going to be writing my evaluation. I remember being sort of
                    astounded maybe six months into the tour and finding out that my immediate
                    supervisor was actually the deputy political counselor. I mean that was complete
                    news to me. That was obviously my fault because I was so junior and na�ve and
                    didn't know how important it was to know who your boss is when you start a job.
                    I think the blame is probably shared. So it was, I would have to say in terms of
                    what I learned and the quality of the professional experience, it was better as
                    a consular officer being section chief than it was being a low man on the totem
                    pole of the political section when my job was really divided between serving the
                    political section and serving the ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Robert Sayre has the reputation of being rather
                        introverted. How did you find dealing with him? How did he operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: It's a little hard for me to characterize. He obviously had previous
                    experience with Brazil and a lot of experience in the Foreign Service. So he was
                    very self-confident in his views. I think he kept things fairly close to the
                    vest, it wasn't very transparent to me what he was thinking. He didn't have the,
                    let's say, the pedagogical instinct that sometimes ambassadors have for staff
                    assistants. Let me tell you how the world works kind of thing. He would express
                    his views, but in some ways I think it was a little bit hard to be a staff
                    assistant because he was a little bit hard to read in terms of what he actually
                    wanted done. My memories of this are just things like he was very upset over the
                    way the section was arranged because someone walking into the ambassador's outer
                    office could see him at the desk if his door was open because that was kind of
                    an unacceptable intrusion into his privacy. I don't remember as clearly some of
                    the really substantive issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mention a relationship that's often not picked up by
                        people but a very important one. That is being the assistant and then the
                        ambassador's secretary because the secretaries when they've risen to that
                        position are very powerful people and often very strong-willed. Did you find
                        that all your newly honed diplomatic skills had to be used? I assume it was
                        a lady.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, it was. And yes, I think it required a great deal of diplomacy,
                    and there were some unpleasant exchanges. I suppose it's a little bit like a
                    second lieutenant and a grizzled sergeant working out a relationship. I think
                    that we did work out a modus operandi in the course of the year. I didn't end up
                    thinking that the ambassador's secretary was power hungry or anything other than
                    this was one of those tough situations. Even the existence of a staff assistant
                    to the ambassador is regarded by the secretary as an insult to her capabilities
                    and her authority. Under those circumstances it's very hard to work
                    constructively, but I think we adjusted in a way that she would saw that it was
                    useful to have me in my job and that I helped her and that she helped me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the DCM?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: DCM was Richard—I'm drawing a blank on the name. I'll have to fill
                    that in later.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, indeed. Richard Johnson whom I liked very much actually. He had
                    been my supervisor in the consular section, and in some respects he filled in
                    those gaps in personal relationship with the ambassador. He was approachable. I
                    could relate to him very easily, and he provided a kind of mentoring in some
                    ways. And he was sympathetic in a way that one got the feeling that he would try
                    to help me in my career subsequently. I didn't get that feeling with Ambassador
                    Sayre even though years later he was very friendly towards me in the State
                    Department when I would run into him. I think in his own way he did have
                    appreciative feelings and kind feelings toward me that just didn't come through
                    that well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, Dick Johnson I knew because we took Serbian
                        together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Oh you did.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I could probably be convinced by someone of great qualities or bad
                    qualities. I can just remember my very positive feelings at the time. He gave me
                    what I needed as a junior officer, and he seemed in a lot of ways to be a good
                    role model for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feeling in both your jobs there that there
                        were tensions or problems between particularly our consulates in Rio and S�o
                        Paolo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes. I think even then, and I had a better perspective on that later,
                    but it was a very odd situation. I don't think there are very many other
                    countries in the world, maybe Pakistan is such a country, where you have these
                    very large, vibrant and important cities that are subservient to a smaller and
                    in many respects less important capital city where all the American senior
                    officials are located. So it's hard to get the officials in the capital city to
                    the consulates in a way they should be. There was in both my first and second
                    tours a continuing effort to grapple with the fact that the building in Rio was
                    not our embassy, with a lot of offices and empty space right in the heart of
                    Rio. In comparison with the embassy which was really built to the anticipated
                    size required in Bras�lia, and was compared by Henry Kissinger to a Coca Cola
                    bottling factory, which I thought wasn't quite fair to the embassy. And then, of
                    course, you had S�o Paolo as the real economic powerhouse and the capital of the
                    most advanced Brazilian states. So there was all kinds of tension there. I was
                    probably too lowly during the first tour to be aware of any kind of real
                    struggles between the ambassador and the consuls general. I suspect they
                    existed.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there was there any movement that you were
                        picking up from your senior colleagues towards changing Brazil from a
                        military government to a civilian one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: The process had already started. I mean Brazil was slowly moving to a
                    civilian government. At the time I was first there, there was, for example, a
                    permitted opposition party in the parliament. In many ways the system was rigged
                    to make sure that the pro-government party stayed in control. But there was a
                    nascent true opposition element that one sees today in Brazil with that one
                    party that was allowed. So it was sort of the beginning of a fairly vibrant
                    Brazilian democracy in the mid '70s when I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find in the embassy that there was any desire on
                        the part of our people to get out to Rio all the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I don't think that was the way it was in the early years. I mean the
                    early years you had all these terribly reluctant cariocas, Brazilians from Rio,
                    who were then dragged out of their very comfortable bureaucratic situations
                    where they could spend lunch on the beach or whatever to the middle of this wild
                    savanna of Bras�lia. Many of them would return frequently to Rio. By the time I
                    was there it wasn't a factor for the Americans because we couldn't afford it. It
                    was expensive to fly to Rio. It wasn't something that one did frequently for
                    fun. There was still, when I was there, an opportunity to make an informal
                    courier run which started in Rio and went up to Salvador and Recife and Belem.
                    That was one of the things that embassy officers looked forward to — a chance to
                    see some of those cities overnight. But, travel was not casually done in those
                    days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then in 1979 what were you looking to do and what
                        happened to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: In '79 I was looking for a job that would be closer to my perceived
                    career interests. I never saw myself as a Latin American political specialist
                    and was interested really in political-military affairs that would allow me to
                    pick up some of the things I had learned in the two-year stint in the Office of
                    Management and Budget's national security division and also to take advantage of
                    my own academic and other interests in military affairs. So I bid on a job in
                    the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs that was in at the time called the
                    Office of Disarmament. I think it was originally Disarmament and Communist
                    Affairs (DCA). They were looking for someone who would work on the arms control
                    aspects of what was then called the gray area systems, later called theater
                    nuclear forces or intermediate range nuclear forces, which had been deliberately
                    left out of the SALT (Strategic Arms Limitation Talks) treaty process as being
                    something that would complicate and burden an already difficult undertaking.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>So in some respects I got in on the ground floor of arms control in 1979 — right
                    around the time when the NATO allies under U.S. leadership agreed to the so
                    called dual track decision to pursue both the modernization of this category of
                    weapons on the NATO side and also to pursue arms control with the Soviets that
                    would get a grip on their new SS-20 missiles that were being deployed. So, I'm
                    not sure how, it seemed like I got that position fairly easily, and I can no
                    longer remember exactly how. But it suited me very well to get back in something
                    that I thought was solidly in line with what I had in mind for my own career. It
                    turned out to be a good position in a number of ways because there was a lot
                    happening. I felt that I made a real contribution albeit at a lower level to how
                    the policy was being implemented, carried out.</p>
                <p>But it also during my first year or two provided me with one of the worst
                    bureaucratic challenges of my entire career because this office was looking
                    basically to create something that it really hadn't had up to that point. This
                    was the arms control office. There was another office in political-military
                    affairs, which I think was called International Security Policy, that felt they
                    needed no help in this at all. They had this issue well in hand. There was
                    another office called Systems Analysis that was also working on this issue in
                    terms of the impact of the SS-20s and the appropriateness of various
                    combinations of U.S. missiles that would balance them. Then there was another
                    bureau, the European Affairs Bureau, that thought they could do this themselves
                    quite nicely, thank you, without the Political-Military Bureau getting involved.
                    So my mission was to insert myself into groups of people that did not want my
                    services — to participate in something that was being led by a deputy assistant
                    secretary (DAS) in the Political-Military Bureau. He was not my DAS. I also had
                    to report to my DAS who was very jealously trying to insert himself in this
                    fairly well oiled machine. So I thought it was about as bad a situation as I
                    could imagine. Two bureaus were fighting over who would have lead in the action.
                    Three different offices in my bureau were involved with one office very much
                    feeling that it was in charge and feeling it didn't really need any help from
                    the interlopers in another office in the bureau. I was feeling that I basically
                    had two different chains of command that I would get yelled at for not serving
                    adequately. If you add some of the personalities here, one can appreciate the
                    problem. Jerry Kahan was the deputy assistant secretary who was in my normal
                    chain of command. But David Gofford, who was later deputy assistant secretary in
                    the European bureau, was the political military DAS who was basically running
                    the show in a well-oiled machine. So and I should add here that the systems
                    analysis person who was working on this was Richard Clarke.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: So my colleague, Ted McNamara, was the office director in the other
                    bureau who was really the one who was more or less in charge of this. All of
                    these folks had illustrious careers after this brief experience, but they were
                    some very bright people, very capable people, not necessarily good team players.
                    It was a very challenging kind of environment. The best thing about the whole
                    experience was that my office director, Mark Palmer, later ambassador to Hungary
                    and prior to that a speech writer for Henry Kissinger. That was actually where I
                    had gotten to know him when I was an intern on the policy planning staff earlier
                    on. So he was a wonderful role model in terms of someone who was pleasant,
                    extremely competent, and had the world in perspective. There was a life outside
                    the job. So in a lot of ways I felt I had the worst of all possible bureaucratic
                    morasses to deal with and then one of the best of all possible office directors
                    to have as a role model.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, first, what was the time frame you were there?</hi>

                <p>THIELMANN: This was 1979 originally to '81, but then I extended a year and this
                    particular situation I described changed when the administration changed, and
                    there were different kinds of implications of the administration change, but the
                    deputy assistant secretary changed. Then obviously, the president of the
                    national security advisors changed. My office director changed. My new office
                    director and immediate supervisor was Jim Dobbins who had a prominent role in a
                    number of different policies. Then there was another officer who sort of shared
                    the burden with me of doing the INF (Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces) arms
                    control work in his office. Richard Burke became the head of the
                    Political-Military Affairs bureau. Robert Blackwell was one of the DAS's there
                    and so it was certainly a way to work closely with and get to know a number of
                    people who were very much in the news some years later. During this period of
                    course one had this very dramatic, bureaucratic rivalry between Richard Perle in
                    the Pentagon and Richard Burke in the State Department. One of the advantages if
                    you want to call it that of being an action officer on INF arms control was I
                    saw from the inside a lot of the kind of encounters that were described by
                    Strobe Talbott in his books about the arms control developments during this era
                    and also those encounters by the very ideological NSC staff of Ronald Reagan in
                    the early years with General Schweitzer and Sven Kramer being the holders of the
                    flame and people who were very interested in seeing new missiles deployed and
                    very much less interested in seeing any kind of arms control outcome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean the Soviet introduction of the SS-20 was in a way
                        we realized in retrospect sort of the last gasp of the Soviets trying to
                        change the NATO alliance.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, I really agree with that. It's not even clear certainly how much
                    the Soviet leadership realized what the SS-20s would do for them in terms of the
                    military balance, but in a way they got sold a bill of goods. They got sold a
                    system without being told what the political-military ramifications were. Eduard
                    Shevardnadze later said as Soviet Foreign Minister that Afghanistan and the
                    Soviet's build-up of SS-20s were the things that led to the disastrous fall of
                    the Soviet Union. He would site how few people were actually involved in giving
                    the go ahead to the SS-20s. But by doing that they introduced a system that
                    would triple the number of warheads the Soviets had available while at the same
                    time making much less vulnerable the missiles on which those warheads were
                    deployed. So it really was a very significant upgrading of Soviet capabilities,
                    and it was something that, although it's often forgotten, prompted a European
                    demand that something be done about this to which the U.S. really responded.</p>
                <p>Of course what Helmut Schmidt said when he gave his famous speech at the
                    Institute for Strategic Studies in London, the west has to do something about
                    this. What he really had in mind was arms control, and what the U.S. had in
                    mind, or what many people had in mind, was deploying systems to counter the
                    Soviet systems. But it was a very historic development I think, and as
                    originally conceived it was providing leverage for good faith negotiations in
                    the spirit of the original December 1979 dual track decision.</p>
                <p>But, when the Reagan administration came in, they didn't like that arms control
                    talk at all. I mean d�tente and disarmament were already dirty words for the
                    Reagan administration. It was very clear that the White House and the Pentagon
                    at the time had no interest whatsoever in pursuing the arms control track. They
                    just wanted to get the systems deployed. It was really a very valiant effort on
                    the part of Alexander Haig in the first months of the administration aided by
                    Margaret Thatcher and the German government represented, at least initially by
                    Helmut Schmidt, explaining what the realities of the European political
                    situation were that kind of got the U.S. back on track and at least nominally
                    kept us on both on the track of both arms control and deployment. So it was very
                    fascinating at that point to be in the Department and see the interaction of
                    European allies with the highly ideological Reagan administration and the role
                    Alexander Haig played as someone who had to bring the unpleasant realities to
                    the White House about what the real political world required.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because Haig had been NATO commander.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: That's right. He knew what the political realities were before he took
                    the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know with this complicated intertwining of
                        responsibilities, did this, dealing with really the probably it and
                        Afghanistan were the two most important issues that we had to deal with at
                        that time. But with all the, everybody trying to get a piece of the action
                        of the State Department, I don't know if the Pentagon had a similar thing or
                        not, but how did it work? Did you find yourself, I mean were just trying to
                        make your marks for your office or were you or anybody able to get things
                        done?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Well, in retrospect and one does benefit from looking back on it years
                    later, I think what I did was part of the enormous service provided by the State
                    Department to save us from ourselves here and retain the general structure of
                    that dual track approach — to keep alive the arms control track at a time when
                    the new leadership was completely cynical about and had no interest at all in
                    getting any kind of arms control outcome because they saw that as something that
                    could only hurt the U.S. by preventing any U.S. missile deployments and ending
                    up resulting in a legitimation of an imbalance in military forces. That's the
                    benign spin on it. So by helping to keep that structure alive and to keep the
                    dialogue open with the Europeans, I think we contributed to what eventually was
                    a good outcome, which was the elimination of this entire category of weapons.
                    It's one of the great ironies of course that this is exactly what Richard Perle
                    in the Pentagon were afraid of in entering into this process. Even ironically it
                    was not the ideal outcome in the thinking of those, at least in the U.S., who
                    came up with the dual track decision. What the U.S. was trying to do was to
                    allow it to move away from all these battle field nuclear weapons, which if they
                    were ever used, would help annihilate the country that we were trying to defend
                    and to build up or to restore a balance in the longer range systems that at
                    least could threaten the Soviet Union rather than what some might call the
                    captive nations of Eastern Europe.</p>
                <p>I think the ideal outcome that was envisioned in the late '70s was that there
                    would not be an elimination of the longer-range systems. You would have a
                    restoration of balance in these long-range systems at a lower level than there
                    would otherwise be, but you would then prepare the way for the elimination of
                    the battlefield systems that made no sense for us. The fact that you ended up
                    kind of eliminating all the longer range systems and keeping the battle field
                    systems was logically kind of inconsistent and second best. But, by providing
                    such an incredible breakthrough with the Soviets, it did eventually lead to an
                    outcome that I think everyone's grateful for today.</p>
                <p>So my role in all that was much more a little piece of the implementation rather
                    than the formulation of what our policy should be. But remembering back on that
                    period, which was very intensive, and involved very long hours, it was preparing
                    talking points and other things for meetings either for the Europeans or in the
                    U.S. interagency setting which seemed at the time always to be either just
                    barely treading water or else losing more and more power to the Pentagon —
                    letting the Pentagon successfully manipulate the process to block the kind of
                    things that should have been happening. So it seemed at the time that I was just
                    participating in a massive bureaucratic defeat like a long retreat burning the
                    villages behind you.</p>

                        than in a way than the Soviets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, right. He was the evil genius who I saw as completely cynical,
                    completely duplicitous, and whatever he said the reason for his position was at
                    a meeting was not necessarily the real reason. Of course he was the author of
                    the zero solution, and he specifically proposed that as the one thing he knew
                    the Soviets would never accept so that he could sabotage the arms control
                    process.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is complete elimination of everything.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Right, that's right. He's the one who had successfully sent the
                    negotiators to Geneva no fall back position because fallback positions might
                    lead to an agreement. He was the one who successfully convinced Washington to
                    reject the dual track that Paul Nitze negotiated with Kvitsinsky in that famous
                    walk in the woods. He was the one who blocked so many other sort of hopeful
                    approaches between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. And he outmaneuvered Richard
                    Byrd. He was by far the most successful. Even though he reported to Freddy Clay
                    at the Pentagon, he was clearly the most powerful person in the Pentagon even
                    including Weinberger on charting the course of INF policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel — granted you're way down — for how
                        the Soviets operated? I mean, were some of the same things going on with the
                        Soviet side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, they, their Richard Perle equivalents, and those who were hostile
                    to any kind of agreement basically found each other — Perle and the Soviet
                    hard-liners. For example Kvitsinsky was obviously someone with whom one could
                    make a deal as Nitze did. But the U.S. basically sabotaged the dual track
                    decision outcome before the Soviets had a chance to. I'm convinced the Soviets
                    would've also sabotaged it. That is hard-liners in Moscow would've rejected what
                    Kvitsinsky negotiated. It's just unfortunately that, because we did it first, we
                    didn't get the benefits that would've accrued to for showing our bona fide's of
                    actually trying to get a solution and with a finger pointing toward the Soviets
                    as the ones who were preventing a solution.</p>

                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Well, I certainly did partly, of course, buttressed by experience in
                    the subsequent years as a political-military officer in Bonn, but even during
                    that job in the Department you would see a lot of interactions at NATO meetings
                    with the various players. There were very impressive players that had an
                    influence much disproportionate to their nation's strength. There was a
                    Norwegian who has since died, but he was — I'm forgetting his last name. He was
                    very impressive. He was someone who would be negotiating the resolutions and
                    communiqu�s in English, and he was extremely astute. He saw through devious
                    efforts of the U.S. to sidetrack arms control and so forth. Yergin Holtz I think
                    was his name. So to witness how effective he was in these meetings basically
                    boxing above his weight, to see what I regard as very effective diplomats like
                    Fred Ruth, R-U-T-H, of Germany, the disarmament commissioner in the German
                    foreign office who was extremely persistent, tried every trick in the book, just
                    kept gnawing at us on going back to the agreement 1979 and the language used and
                    the philosophy at a time when without that kind of intense lobbying one might
                    have seen Alexander Haig lose to the hawks and kind of throw the whole thing
                    out. Saw a lot of that, and then of course the British who had their own
                    particular national interest to uphold and, while sympathetic — and Thatcher was
                    clearly sympathetic to the Reagan agenda — had no interest in abandoning arms
                    control as a talking point and as an objective. So she would deliver stern
                    lectures to Reagan in private, and of course the British diplomats would reflect
                    her point of view. So we had, we got maximum benefit I would argue, out of the
                    special relationship and having the British tell it like it was to U.S.
                    officials who might not have been inclined to listen to those French and German
                    naysayers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the role of the NSC (National Security Council)
                        during this period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Well, they had an important role just because they were the NSC and
                    they were allied to the Weinberger-Richard Perle point of view. They were able
                    to reinforce that combination of ignorance and ideological predisposition that
                    Ronald Reagan represented. But looking back I don't think that they were that
                    effective. They were not brilliant like Richard Perle was. Schneider was a
                    strange sort of disheveled former military officer who had been famous in
                    Germany for telling his troops to send home their wives and families because
                    there was going to be a nuclear war in Europe. He really didn't have much of a
                    grip on reality, and he was extremely disheveled. His papers were always
                    confused. He was someone who would lean across the table early on in the Reagan
                    administration and quote from the Republican party platform in terms of saying
                    what should be done and would accuse David Gofford, then a deputy assistant
                    secretary in the European bureau, of being a McGovernite arms controller. That's
                    the level of sophistication you had represented by the NSC. Sven Kramer, who was
                    really sort of the other NSC member who played a key role in INF, really saw
                    this as sort of a moral crusade in a way and would find like-minded allies or
                    seek like-minded allies in Europe who kind of understood what the stakes were
                    and wanted to go the right way. Those people were mostly outside what I would
                    call the mainstream in the foreign ministries and defense ministries of these
                    various countries. So I don't think the NSC was particularly effective at the
                    time.</p>

                        he was, they felt he wasn't part of the team and he was trying to grab too
                        much power.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: That was exactly what my memory was at the time. So in a sense he
                    wasn't that politically effective, and it's very hard not to compare Colin
                    Powell with Alexander Haig. I mean, there's so many parallels in terms of having
                    a secretary of state who is very savvy in terms of military affairs — who
                    because of his background understands very well the importance of the bilateral
                    and multi-lateral relationships that underlie the issue of the day and who in
                    both cases was never really considered part of the team. I mean those are all
                    very strong parallels. The difference of course is in the temperament and
                    personality. I mean Alexander Haig made problems for himself because of his
                    personality that Colin Powell, who was much smoother, did not make. But in the
                    end they both ended up as losing on a lot of issues and ultimately, let's say,
                    having a shorter tenure than they might have wanted under other

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When we're in during this time you were doing this, '79 to
                        '82, I take it there was no feeling that the Soviet Union was undergoing a
                        profound change, I mean, that it was, well, I mean it was losing its steam
                        and weakening. But that hadn't happened, had it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: No, I don't remember encountering that kind of analysis at all during
                    that period of time. I do remember when I was doing Russian area studies—this
                    would be in the beginning of 1987—encountering in the literature a country that
                    was really in some respects falling apart. I mean no one was predicting collapse
                    of the empire, but there was much more of a focus on things coming apart at the
                    seams. It wasn't like that at all in the late '70s to my memory, and in the
                    early '80s. It was “the Soviets are ten feet tall.” They were just increasing
                    their capabilities in leaps and bounds, and, if the U.S. didn't do something
                    drastic, we would be rolled over. I mean I thought that the Reagan
                    administration was itself totally irresponsible for exaggerating Soviet
                    capabilities. But I think even those among us who felt the administration was
                    being totally irresponsible in exaggerating Soviet strength were not perceiving
                    the real threats to the Soviet empire that we saw a decade later.</p>

                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: In '82 I got a job as one member of a three-person political-military
                    unit in the U.S. embassy in Bonn. That put me then in a role that involved even
                    more the implementation of the INF policies than I had been involved in at the
                    Department in the country that was most important to the INF's successful
                    implementation at the most important time, the year of the missile in Europe. I
                    felt really privileged by fate to be in what I remember as probably the most
                    exciting and dramatic role I had in the Foreign Service.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 26th of January, 2005. Greg, you were in Bonn
                        from when until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I was in Bonn from September 1982 to I think July of 1985. I remember
                    very well the day that I arrived in Germany because it was September 17th the
                    day when there was a parliamentary confidence vote in the German parliament that
                    resulted in the fall of Helmut Schmidt's government. This was when the Free
                    Democrats and Hans-Dietrich Genscher pulled out of the Social Democratic-Free
                    Democratic coalition. This left the SPD (Social Democratic Party) with a
                    minority, requiring or allowing a new realignment that would remove Helmut
                    Schmidt as chancellor. Since Schmidt had been chancellor for quite a while and a
                    very impressive and successful chancellor, this was a very big day and the very
                    day I arrived. This allowed me to say later that I brought down the Helmut
                    Schmidt government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any residual resentment, suspicion on the part
                        of the Schmidt government after Carter pulled the rug from under him over
                        the neutron bomb episode? He had made Schmidt get way out in front of him
                        and then cut him off at the knees by changing his mind. I would've thought
                        that that Schmidt's SPD would have been very suspicious about anything the
                        Americans might want the Germans to do. I mean, was that around or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, I know it was very much in the air, and Schmidt was very bitter
                    about the whole handling of the neutron bomb. I think that convinced Schmidt
                    that Jimmy Carter was not a competent manager of national security issues. It
                    seems to me that the irony is that in many ways Schmidt and Carter should've
                    been close allies because I think that their sophisticated understanding of
                    nuclear doctrine and the exigencies of the western alliance security situation
                    really overlapped quite well. I think it was much more of a problem of
                    personality and not very competent management on the part of the U.S. that
                    really embittered Schmidt. But Schmidt had a lot of his own problems. He was a
                    pragmatist, a pro-defense Social Democrat at a time when the party was leaning
                    pretty far left. A lot of anti-American sentiment and a lot of leftover negative
                    feelings that came out of the whole Vietnam era, were very much in the minds of
                    the rising SDP leadership. So Schmidt himself, in the best of circumstances, had
                    a very difficult time managing the German security position. I think he felt
                    that the American leadership made that all the more difficult. That was the
                    background of the neutron bomb issue.</p>
                <p>The other little twist is Schmidt of all the Europeans was the one who was most
                    instrumental in the NATO missile deployment decision because Schmidt complained
                    at a very conspicuous and well publicized International Institute of Strategic
                    Studies conference in London that the SALT-2 treaty, the latest strategic arms
                    agreement with the Soviet Union, had not adequately addressed Soviet nuclear
                    systems that threatened Europe. Foremost among them were what we later called
                    the INF category missiles, SS4, SS5 and SS20 as well as the backfire medium
                    range bomber. Those were going to be addressed in SALT-3. They were considered
                    gray area systems. But Schmidt argued that this was a flaw of the SALT-2 treaty
                    and that it needed to be addressed. Now this was constantly quoted in the west
                    to justify missile deployments, but Schmidt would've much preferred that the
                    systems be addressed by arms control and by an agreement for the U.S. not to
                    deploy and for the Soviets to get rid of their systems, which is ultimately what
                    happened. But Schmidt spent a lot of time trying to explain what he meant in
                    registering that initial complaint about the need to do something about the SS20
                    missile modernization on the other side of the Cold War curtain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, Greg, just to set the stage, when you arrived, was
                        there the feeling the Social Democrats were out and the CDU (Christian
                        Democratic Union) back in? So people were rubbing their hands and saying,
                        okay, now we can get on to more conservative government and to making a
                        strong response to the Soviets. Was there a feeling that things had changed
                        for the better or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: There was certainly the feeling in Washington that Helmut Kohl, the
                    leader of the Christian Democrats, could lead a party that was more naturally
                    inclined to support the United States, more conservative on defense issues and
                    that would make the task of the U.S. easier. The problem, which the Reagan
                    administration encountered was that it had little feeling for and less sympathy
                    for European concerns. The Reagan administration found out that Kohl genuinely
                    believed in a dual track decision and worked hard on the arms control part of it
                    almost as much as Helmut Schmidt did. So Germany became the leader of European
                    pressure on the U.S. to negotiate seriously on the arms control track. This was
                    dealing with the Reagan administration whose most influential members like
                    Richard Perle, assistant secretary of defense, and I knew this from inside,
                    wanted to sabotage any hopes of an agreement. He wanted to give the world the
                    impression the U.S. was seeking arms control but to ensure that it never
                    happened. Ronald Reagan never understood the issues even at a superficial level.
                    So he was hopelessly out of it and had to be lectured by his good friend
                    Margaret Thatcher to avoid his agreeing to give up all nuclear weapons later at
                    Reykjavik.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, you get there in September '82. Could you talk about
                        your job and what were the issues? Who was the ambassador and what was the
                        set up of the area you were working in? Then we'll talk about the
                        issues.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: The ambassador was Arthur Burns who had been chairman of the Federal
                    Reserve. He was a very distinguished American, a sort of a non-career diplomat
                    and one of the best arguments for political appointees. Anyone could point to
                    someone like Arthur Burns. He was someone who actually had been a professor of
                    young Helmut Schmidt, helping teach Schmidt economics, which was clearly one of
                    Schmidt's strong suits. So Burns had very deep respect from the Germans even
                    though there was a very wide-spread disdain for President Reagan to whom Burns
                    obviously reported. Burns set a high standard I think in the embassy for a deep
                    approach to issues. He would really conduct seminars in the embassy with foreign
                    service officers briefing him on topics, not always directly related to the
                    implementation of a foreign policy but to issues at a deep and substantive
                    level. So that was an intellectually stimulating atmosphere. It was a little bit
                    different as regards the security function because Burns kept admitting to my
                    bosses that he really didn't know much about this at all. He would sort of trust
                    us in the management of these issues, which contrasted greatly with my poor
                    colleagues on the economic side where Burns knew everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I talked to somebody who was I think an economic counselor
                        at one point to Burns and he said, “How can I do this? I mean here is the
                        top economist in the United States, and I am supposed to be handling the
                        economics and be his support in this field.” I don't envy him. We had it
                        much easier.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: So we didn't want to let the ambassador down on the security issues.
                    But in many ways we had quite a bit of leeway in carrying out our instructions
                    from Washington in the best way that we could see. The political section, I
                    might just say at that time as I look back on my career, was really top notch.
                    It was full of people who had served previously in Germany; sometimes German
                    experts in the State Department pejoratively called the German Club, the German
                    Mafia. I didn't really see it in a pejorative way. I think the great strength of
                    the Department, was they had a whole stable of foreign service officers with
                    experience who would've excelled in any area of the world. That's really the way
                    I would characterize the political section at the time. You had a couple of
                    people who were Berlin specialists, all the arcana of that odd, unique status of
                    the city of West Berlin. They would be steeped in that. You had a lawyer who
                    worked that issue. Then we had obviously the external section, the internal
                    section as embassies usually have and a group of people who were successful
                    afterwards too, like the political counselor who later became our ambassador to
                    East Germany, Dick Barkley. So it was I thought a very strong section and I felt
                    privileged also to be the junior of the three political-military officers. One
                    was a civilian I the office of secretary of defense, and then there was a more
                    senior veteran foreign service officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Root Felts was my immediate supervisor. Root had had a lot of
                    experience both military and in Germany. So he was a very good mentor for me as
                    a young officer. He knew a lot about these issues but less about the practical
                    implementation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: His name was what, Root?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: H. Root Felts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Root, R-O</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: R-O-O-T. One of the little humorous side notes to this time in the
                    office was that Root had a secretary named Ruth, R-U-T-H. One of his most
                    important interlocutors in the German government was the commissioner for
                    disarmament in the foreign office named Frederick Ruth. So it was not infrequent
                    that you would hear in our office Ruth saying to Root that Ruth was on the
                    phone. So there was sort of a three-way Ruth-Root situation. Americans would
                    pronounced Ruth's name Ruth because R-U-T-H. Anyway that was the general setting
                    of the political section and the political military unit. It was an extremely
                    intense time since there was a widespread perception, I think a correct one,
                    whether or not this dual track decision would ever be implemented was going to
                    be determined by what happened in Germany. So there was great anxiety in
                    Washington and great attention to the cables that we would send out commenting
                    on what was happening there, and the question in the back of everyone's mind was
                    always, “will the Germans hold this or not.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, the dual track being the—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: The 1979 decision, but for both arms control and commitment to
                    deployment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How, when you got there, how did each stand? Was anything
                        happening on either end?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: At that point nothing much was happening on the arms control front
                    because frankly both sides were basically posturing for the public. The Soviets
                    were saying that they would consider freezing or decreasing the number of
                    deployments as long as the U.S. would promise not to deploy anything. So in
                    other words they were offering to freeze the imbalance. The U.S. had a proposal,
                    the zero-zero solution that basically said neither side should have any weapons
                    in this category, which ironically is ultimately what happened. The irony is
                    that I know from inside conversations that the purpose of this position on the
                    part of the U.S. was to ensure that there would be no agreement because the
                    perception was that the Soviets would never accept freezing systems when they
                    already had hundreds of them and we didn't have any — not freezing but agreeing
                    to eliminate all their systems without any U.S. systems to be used as leverage.
                    In fact that judgment was correct in that we had to go through all of these
                    tense years. The Soviets really only started negotiating seriously once the
                    first cruise missiles were being deployed to the five countries where they were
                    being stationed and the first Pershing ballistic missiles were being
                    deployed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also at that time the Soviets really didn't have much
                        leadership did they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: That's right. They had the kind of leaders that needed to be propped
                    up from behind when they went to the polls and everything. I'm not remembering
                    right now when Brezhnev died, but they had at least three in succession that
                    were seriously health challenged.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Andropov and then Chernenko was it? Anyway, you had the
                        three before Gorbachev, and then Gorbachev had to work his way in. I mean he
                        didn't immediately jump in with full power.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: That's right. That's right. He was immediately misread by the CIA and
                    Soviet specialists. That gets to something later in my career. I remember
                    hearing from all of the learned treatises on Gorbachev. “There is nothing new in
                    Gorbachev except maybe he's a little bit smarter than a dedicated Communist
                    who's Marxist-Leninist in every way. Don't expect any shifts from the Soviet
                    Union.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What piece of the pie did you have in your office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I would tend to work more on the arms control agreement side of it. A
                    big part of the political military function in Germany was managing those issues
                    arising out of the fact that there were 200,000 American soldiers stationed in
                    Germany. Any time that happens you have elaborate status of forces agreements
                    and all kinds of interface between the American military and the German military
                    that would be in many cases managed or at least would attempt to be influenced
                    by the embassy seeing it as a very important piece of the foreign policy
                    picture. So that was handled much more by my other two colleagues in the unit. I
                    was supposed to be the expert on all the ins and outs of the U.S. arms control
                    position and our dialogue with the Germans about all those large and small
                    issues that came up during negotiations. When for example Paul Nitze would come
                    back from his negotiations in Geneva with the Soviets and brief the German
                    government, he would do that religiously and was always treated like visiting
                    royalty when he came. I was sort of the default control officer for his visits,
                    the one the embassy assigned to take care of Nitze. I'd take notes for him, and
                    there was an unusual combination of things that made the Germans very solicitous
                    and respectful of Paul Nitze. One was that Nitze had a background in German
                    affairs and had spent earlier in his career significant amounts of time in
                    Germany. He could understand some German for example, and he was respected for
                    his intellect even though the Germans would've recognized him as hard liner in
                    the Reagan administration. There were hard-liners, and then there were the
                    nutcases. It always seemed to be a battle between those two sections.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You would put Richard Perle and company in the
                        nutcases.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Well, Richard Perle was too smart to be a nutcase. I would just say
                    that Perle was much more cynical than Nitze was and that Perle was completely
                    untrustworthy in what he said. One could not believe him when he made an
                    argument. Nitze was much more sincere in his orientation. The nutcases were more
                    like General Schneider who was an advisor on the NSC and who, when he earlier
                    had been in the field in Germany, had the habit of telling the troops to send
                    their wives and children home because there was going to be nuclear war in
                    Germany and they should get ready for it and who would in a State Department
                    meeting that I attended for example lean across the table and tell the Deputy
                    Secretary of State Dave Gofford that he was a McGovernite arms controller and
                    start reading from the Republican Party platform in making arguments about which
                    details of the U.S. policy should be formulated. So that's kind of what I'm
                    derisively terming the lunatic fringe. Since there was always a battle for the
                    rather vacant mind of Ronald Reagan on these issue one never knew exactly which
                    part of this spectrum of opinion would come up. Even though Nitze was quite
                    elderly, the Germans were very reassured that someone of Nitze's stature and
                    intellectual capability and pragmatism was in a powerful position. So they did
                    everything they could to strengthen Nitze's position, and, of course, we in the
                    embassy would basically report on this situation which reminded Washington of
                    what a great asset the U.S. had with Nitze in trying to preserve good U.S.
                    German relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'm sure there was a split in Germany over what we
                        were trying to do particularly on introducing the Pershings and the Cruise
                        missiles. How did that play out in the German government, people you were
                        dealing with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Well, one of the concerns we had throughout this entire period was
                    that the opinion polls showed that the majority of Germans were dead against any
                    missile deployments in Germany. I mean this is the NIMBY syndrome, not in my
                    back yard. One of the effective slogans I think was along the lines of, “it's
                    better to be red than to have the missile deployment implemented.” There was a
                    very real fear that the end of the world was nigh that there was a real chance
                    there would be a nuclear exchange and we would be very susceptible to the
                    banishing of the nuclear sword by the Soviets and the threats they would make.
                    So you had millions of Germans on the street, a kind of historic linking of
                    hands across many miles of German countryside. It was in this environment that
                    there were so many doubts about whether or not the German government would hold
                    because it was obviously politically damaging for the government to persevere in
                    supporting the dual track decision. So a lot of our conversation with the German
                    government was on the various elements of our policies, our statements, our
                    deployments which would make it harder for them to sustain the dual track
                    decision to which they were committed. That involved all kinds of things like
                    the fear we had that one of these demonstrators would break through a security
                    line somewhere, approach a live nuclear weapon, and get shot by some young
                    American soldier. I know this is something that really haunted Ambassador Burns
                    throughout that period. We had during that time a U.S. Pershing-I missile that
                    caught fire and was snaking its way through a German village. There was a lot of
                    attention about the effects of a nuclear warhead being burned up and to what
                    extent there would be radioactive contamination in the area. Those were the kind
                    of issues that we spent a lot of time with.</p>
                <p>I had really a couple of missions. My main focus was dealing with people in the
                    German defense ministry and the German foreign office where, to whom I would
                    represent U.S. policies and lobby them in effect to cooperate with our version
                    of the implementation of our policies. But an equally important part of our job,
                    and I would say probably the most important part of our job, was to make
                    Washington sensitive to how the Germans looked at these issues and where the
                    opportunities were and where the perils were in carrying out policies the way we
                    did. This was also the period when Ronald Reagan visited Germany and visited the
                    Bitburg cemetery that had the graves of SS soldiers. I can talk a little bit
                    like that if—now—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: This visit I think brought a lot of insensitivity on both sides of the
                    Atlantic about the way issues would be perceived on the other side. When the
                    team came to prepare for Ronald Reagan's visit, it included Mike Deaver and
                    several other members of the White House staff. My memory at the time was that
                    they were more concerned about using their diplomatic passports to get a
                    reduction on BMWs in Munich than they were about some of the substantive aspects
                    of the issue. That might not be fair, and it was obviously not my little piece
                    of it, but it is true that when Deaver visited Bitburg cemetery, it was snowing
                    and the weather was unpleasant and he didn't want to get out of his car. Well,
                    you can't really read those tombstones and see that they're SS members when you
                    don't take a stroll through the cemetery.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I was interviewing just a couple of days ago Tom
                        Johnson who was the USIA officer in Frankfurt who went out to Bitburg and
                        asked the curator, whoever was the manager of the place if there were any
                        problems here. He said, no. I think the ranking SS member who was buried
                        there was a lieutenant, and they were mostly boys and they were drafted into
                        the Waffen-SS. I mean it was essentially a made up issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Right. Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think these, they were mostly people who had been bombed
                        during the Ardennes offensive in Bitburg, a lot of civilians were
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I don't want to suggest that the issue was fairly represented, but
                    rather that there was not sufficient sensitivity to the way camera images would
                    play it up. There are other instances of German insensitivity. For example the
                    chancellor wanted to as a gesture of respect to have a ceremony which would
                    involve torchlight parades of German soldiers with shiny helmets and beating on
                    the bong of a beer barrel and doing a lot of sort of German marching songs that
                    would've been a nice supplement to the SS cemetery visit I'm sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anybody in that era thinking about Hitler, during the
                        Hitler regime the troops used to march in torchlight parades in Nuremberg
                        and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, the Nazi film makers loved this kind of stuff. Kohl's deaf ear to
                    the way that that would go over in the U.S. was something that we finally
                    overcame. It was really my boss, Phelps, who can take credit for that event not
                    happening. But another thing that interfered with the design of the visit that
                    would've been the most meaningful on the American side was for example a visit
                    to a concentration camp. I think it had been liberated by British forces. There
                    were other camps that had been liberated by American forces, in fact most of
                    them were. If I remember correctly, we highlighted a camp that had both the
                    American Army liberating it and a large number of inmates who were German
                    political prisoners as something that would perfectly address the themes that
                    the Germans were victims of the Nazi dictatorship and not just the Jews of
                    Europe. Of course it would emphasize the U.S. role in bringing that terrible
                    dictatorship to an end. Well, there were internal German political reasons
                    having to do with who was the minister of this German state and that German
                    state. That wouldn't wash, but again there was sort of a conspiracy on both
                    sides to prevent this visit from having the right kind of symbolism. It was so
                    important not to make things worse since Reagan's image was so negative. We were
                    trying to do everything we could to dampen down that perception on the part of
                    the Europeans of Reagan the cowboy. So it was a bit of an ill-starred visit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I appreciate your comment. Tom Johnson had the feeling,
                        again he was a USIA officer and looking at it from a public relations
                        perspective, was saying that the Germans respected this visit because
                        despite the pressure Reagan kept his word and went there as opposed to the
                        feeling about Jimmy Carter and all that. So that this had in a way came out
                        positive on the German side. I don't know if this holds water in your
                        feelings or not.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I think there were Germans who respected the fact that he came. I
                    would hesitate to say that we benefited or got a big bounce in our relations
                    from this visit. I don't remember having that impression. I'm confused about
                    whether or not Reagan's “tear down this wall” speech in Berlin was on that
                    visit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it came later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I think it did. Later on too with the way that the negotiations
                    actually proceeded. Even though I would say that Gorbachev gets most of the
                    credit for the success of the INF negotiations, Reagan being a party to that and
                    Reagan doing things like going to the Berlin Wall and saying “tear down this
                    wall” helped significantly to amend some of the more negative images of
                    Reagan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again put a time context Kohl and Mitterrand not long
                        before had gone to Verdun and stood, bowed their heads, holding hands. I
                        think both their fathers had fought at Verdun. This was really sort of the,
                        almost the leitmotif that brought France and Germany together again.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, I would say that an awful lot of things brought the two countries
                    together including the very successful, widespread and visionary exchange
                    programs in the 1950s. But the distance traveled from that historic enmity
                    between France and Germany and in the wake of this terribly bloody war was
                    enormous. I too remember that meeting and the photograph of them holding their
                    hands as being really sort of transcendental in cementing the image of a France
                    and Germany that had common interests and had not forgotten the past but put the
                    past behind them. It had the same power I think as on the other side, bowing in
                    Poland to sort of atone for the sins of the Germans during the war. Those images
                    were almost iconic in their power. Kohl, who had a number of problems that
                    history will not look on lightly, was an historian and did have a very deep
                    sense of history and a sense of the importance of Germany transcending some of
                    the things that were deeply embedded in its history, anti-Semitism and animosity
                    toward France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling that you were getting at this time
                        when you were in Bonn about Soviet intentions. I mean was there a feeling
                        that the Soviets were on the move, I mean they had already gone in late '79
                        into Afghanistan and all. Were we concerned that something might happen at
                        that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: It's hard to remember exactly what the feeling was, but I think I
                    simultaneously had two feelings at the time. I don't know how widely to
                    generalize it, but one was that the U.S. leadership was exaggerating Soviet
                    strength. We painted the Soviets ten-feet tall in every respect, and I judge the
                    Reagan administration extremely irresponsible in saying things about the
                    military balance which just were not true. Even cutting through all of the
                    hyperbole and exaggeration, the fact was there were twenty-two Soviet divisions
                    in East Germany and that we knew enough about Soviet war plans and intentions to
                    know that their game plan was not to sit and hold ground, which is basically
                    what ours was but rather to move through Germany quickly to the English Channel.
                    So the fact that that enormous preponderance of numbers on the other side of the
                    German-Czech border was always sort of looming out there as a reality which
                    belied a lot of the Soviet claims that their intentions were peaceful. If they
                    really wanted to defend Eastern Europe, their numbers and deployments would've
                    been different. That was I think our feeling at the time and still the feeling
                    today. That having been said I don't think that those of us at the time thought
                    that the Soviets were tempted to attack Western Europe. I mean that's the whole
                    purpose of having strong NATO defenses so they wouldn't be tempted. I think our
                    concern was that you didn't want to do things to create temptation. You didn't
                    want to do things that would create such a huge imbalance that there would be
                    intimidation on the part of the west or an inclination to do whatever the
                    Soviets demanded. That was what we were trying to prevent.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was one of the nightmare scenarios was that somehow
                        the West Germans might come up with a willingness to neutralize Germany in
                        order to reunite and all. Was that around as a thought or at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: I don't think people were seriously worried about it as something that
                    was on the horizon as an imminent danger, a clear and present threat or
                    anything. What I think, what I think was out there was the feeling that if one
                    started down a certain road then there would always be the temptation for the
                    Germans to reunite at the expense of what reuniting under some circumstances
                    would actually mean. But I think that really any kind of high anxiety about that
                    was really put to bed years earlier. I think most of the sober American analysts
                    of Germany believed that there was a strong majority in Germany that felt that
                    rapprochement with East Germany was necessary and desirable. But it had to be
                    done carefully and with regard to preserving the kind of system that West
                    Germany had developed so successfully.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find your German counterparts? Were you
                        working as a team or was it difficult to work with them? I'm talking about
                        both in the foreign ministry and the ministry of defense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: In some ways it was mostly fun to work with the German defense
                    ministry. I was left with a very high impression of the caliber of the German
                    officers, and most of our counterparts in the arms control directorate and the
                    defense ministry and the director that dealt with the U.S. were very impressive
                    officers. They were knowledgeable about the United States. Many spoke excellent
                    English. They were very politically savvy. I would have to say more politically
                    savvy than the average Pentagon officer. So they had a degree of sophistication
                    that made it easy as a foreign service officer and a diplomat to talk about the
                    nuances of foreign policy, and they were very plugged into the psychology of the
                    German people as well. They had a more rigorous program in the Bundeswehr to,
                    let's say, be well attuned to the way average Germans were looking at issues,
                    and to some extent it was a reflection of the fact that they still had the
                    draft, still do. So they had that big input. They had to deal with the average
                    Germans because they were being received by the German military all the time.
                    They were composing large numbers of the Bundeswehr. So there was great
                    sensitivity to public relations and that kind of thing. So that was very
                    positive, but I also had a lot of respect for my foreign office counterparts and
                    developed some close friendships with some of those with whom I had contact. One
                    of my principal contacts at the foreign office during those years was a special
                    assistant to German Foreign Minister Genscher. His name was Wolfgang Ischinger
                    he is now the German ambassador to Washington. It was at the time a very
                    comfortable relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From our perspective, from the embassy's perspective, how
                        did we view the Kohl-Genscher relationship, and, particularly in your field,
                        was there a distance between the two?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: I think, if “we” here means we the Americans who worked on these
                    issues, there was not much respect for Genscher. He was seen as a very slimy
                    kind of politician, incredibly political in every sense of the word, and I think
                    my own personal feelings were out of the mainstream. I was very impressed by
                    Genscher. I hope that doesn't reflect on me being slimy, but I saw, first of all
                    I mean now looking back on Genscher at an incredibly long range. I mean he was
                    the dean of foreign ministers in the West. He had many years of controlling
                    German foreign policy. He was the spokesman for German foreign policy in an
                    SDP/FDP government, Social Democrats and Free Democrats, and he was the foreign
                    policy spokesman in the Christian Democratic/Free Democratic government even
                    though his party sort of hovered around five to ten percent of the vote. I mean
                    that's an incredible political achievement. But aside from his being politically
                    astute as a practitioner of foreign affairs, I have to admit that Genscher in
                    many ways to me is a model of the way countries should deal with neighboring
                    countries that are hostile to them. Genscher would deal with Soviet provocations
                    and sort of outrageous policies and threats in a very consistent fashion. I
                    would describe it as firm, and he offered criticism more in sorrow than in
                    anger. He dealt with the Soviets as one would deal with a slightly unbalanced
                    uncle. To me that was much more productive over time than the U.S. tendency to
                    get in a snit and basically mimic sort of outrageous Soviet insults and
                    everything with our own. That's a caricature, but I think I'm trying to get at
                    some differences in technique here between Genscher — and it wasn't just
                    Genscher — and the Americans. It was Genscher and some of the other Germans on
                    the scene as well. But the Germans because of their very vulnerable position in
                    Europe and the fact that they had all these countries who were basically under
                    control of the Soviets had a much more nuanced policy and one in which they
                    would think twice about sort of egregious insults to the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a view that when Genscher talked Cold War he was
                        talking for Kohl or was there a feeling about Genscher saying this, but
                        maybe we ought to get to Kohl or was that an issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I think the U.S. sought to use Kohl against Genscher or appeal to Kohl
                    to keep Genscher under control as it were. But I don't think we were good enough
                    to really find fissures and fault lines that we could do that very well.
                    Genscher was way ahead of us in making sure that his back was covered with Kohl
                    and that he was working as a part of the coalition government. I think Kohl
                    appreciated what Genscher brought to the government and would give him the
                    handling of foreign policy issues. That's not to deny that I'm sure there was a
                    lot hard bargaining and maneuvering between Kohl and his foreign minister. But I
                    would have to say that I think they worked fairly well together. It wasn't like,
                    well, let's say Colin Powell and George W. Bush. I mean there was one German
                    government I think and not two.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I realize you were pretty low on the feeding chain still
                        in the embassy, but how did you and the embassy, when you were working with
                        the Germans on this very important issue, deal with the fact that you
                        thought that the president didn't have a clue of what was going on in regard
                        to this particular issue? It's kind of hard to evoke the president's name if
                        you're kind of making reservations all the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes. This really gets at I think a recurrent theme in my own career,
                    and I suspect many other foreign service officers' careers, of trying to decide
                    how to represent policies of someone whose understanding you don't respect.
                    There are at least two different poles of thinking on this. One, is that the you
                    have to make sure that you are understood all the time to be the spokesman for a
                    government whoever the president is and that you tow the line on every single
                    policy nuance and twist so that there won't be any misunderstanding. When they
                    hear you, they're hearing the spokesman of the United States and of its
                    president. I lean a little bit toward the other pole which is to say that one of
                    the most important qualities in the diplomatic relationship is credibility, and,
                    if one aligns oneself so closely to a president that he has credibility
                    problems, one just sacrifices one's own personal credibility without being
                    persuasive. To be merely regarded as a shell raises the question about well, why
                    don't you just fax me your talking points? I don't really need to see you in
                    person. But I think the real value of the diplomat is to help explain what seems
                    inexplicable and around the margins to make bad policies seem less bad than
                    perhaps they really are. That I tried to do. In some sense I guess I tried to
                    disguise what I thought the reality was with the Reagan administration, which
                    was a brightly lit house with nobody home and some chaos and real questions
                    about who was in charge as the various factions battled it out. So in a way I
                    was presenting a policy that was more coherent and more logical than maybe the
                    reality was. That was, I thought, one of the services I could perform.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you did have a policy that made sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: That's right and on the dual track decision in many ways I felt that I
                    was trying to carry out the policy that had been agreed to by the United States
                    and by the Western European governments, and that it was some of the people in
                    Washington who were sort of wandering off the reservation. It was quite clear
                    that, when the Reagan administration came in, they didn't like this arms control
                    track at all. Alexander Haig and Margaret Thatcher and the Germans had to argue
                    very hard to get back on track to what the two countries had agreed. The Germans
                    made pretty clear that you're not going to have any missiles here if you abandon
                    the arms control track. That kind of blunt talk on the part of the Germans and
                    the British, and even the French ironically, through Alexander Haig in those
                    early months basically did get the U.S. back on track. So the policy that we
                    were representing, even though at times it was not clear that Washington was
                    going to adhere to it, was the U.S. government's official policy and the policy
                    that had been solemnly agreed in a previous administration. Ultimately it was
                    the policy that was carried out. So that, that was the policy that we were
                    representing. I think that, in maintaining your credibility as a diplomat, means
                    occasionally it is permissible to let interlocutors with whom you have a good
                    personal relationship to signal that you have some skepticism about a particular
                    policy. But the way I saw it was it's very important to use your knowledge of
                    what's going on on the American side to explain what may seem irrational — to
                    explain the political realities in the United States. This is especially easy
                    when you're dealing with the representatives of a foreign democracy. I mean,
                    they understand what politicians do, and they understand how domestic issues
                    often dominate in policies that have a foreign policy element. So to me that was
                    part of what my job was — to help them understand why Reagan would do what he
                    was doing, what he really meant to do. Oftentimes it was much more benign in its
                    intention than in its application. So in a sense I was defending the American
                    government by explaining why Reagan was doing these things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the German media treated this whole issue
                        while you were there, '82 to '85?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Well, there were a lot of sharp criticism in the media, and I think it
                    would really be a minority of the media that, in the views of most Americans,
                    would treat the United States fairly. There was a lot of slanted analysis and
                    sort of snide remarks, but then there was also a great underlying reservoir of
                    good will. There was a lot of gratitude about our role in the post-war era. At
                    least on the conservative side of the spectrum there was a lot of support for
                    the essential U.S. role in helping the Germans cope with this huge threat right
                    on their borders. Even on the other side, beyond all the sniping I think even on
                    the left, there were very few who just wanted to get the Americans out of
                    Germany. So part of it was I think developing a thick skin for some of the snide
                    carping at the time and understanding and appreciating that there were very deep
                    roots for the implicit contract between Germany and the U.S. Germany would put
                    up with tanks rolling over farm lands and jets screaming overhead and everything
                    because it didn't want to think about the alternative.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there what developed in your particular
                        field? Up to '85, how did things stand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Actually it was in '85 , no it was in '83, that there was a critical
                    Bundestag vote. It ultimately got down to a vote of the German parliament
                    whether or not to go forward with the deployments of cruise missiles and
                    Pershing-II missiles in Germany. There was tentativeness as regards the Germans
                    signing on the bottom line. Kind of all the way up to the very end, I mean, the
                    German government basically used as leverage that they hadn't really approved
                    that arrival of the first missile in order to get the U.S. to have more
                    forthcoming arms control policy. It played out in a very dramatic way when the
                    U.S. was supposed to send the first systems over. They just could not land until
                    the Germans said yes and the German parliament had a debate. I remember
                    bicycling down to the parliament because of the huge crowds to witness it. The
                    parliament voted to approve it. Within hours the first Pershing-II missiles
                    landed at Frankfurt, and the head of the Social Democrats, leading spokesman
                    said this was a black day in German history. The Soviets reacted by stomping out
                    of the U.S.-Soviet INF arms control talks and threatened commensurate
                    deployments on the Soviet side, which of course they already had. So all they
                    could do was to make some gestures about deploying SS-22 missiles forward.</p>
                <p>To me that late 1983 vote was a real watershed in the history of Western Europe.
                    The Soviets had tried everything from the date of the December dual track
                    decision of NATO until that vote. They had tried everything to make sure that
                    the Germans never accepted the missile deployments. They could use the fear of
                    new missile deployments and the Soviet reaction to bring about a sea change in
                    the German political scene. It didn't work. I mean the German parliament and the
                    government held even though it wasn't very popular among the people. There
                    really was a solid consensus by the majority of the parliament in representing
                    the parties that this was a necessary thing to do. That was really the beginning
                    of serious Soviet negotiations on INF even though it wasn't recognized as such
                    at the time. It was only really when Gorbachev became leader of the Soviet Union
                    and had Shevardnadze as foreign minister that the Soviets could acknowledge to
                    themselves that they had really blown it. They had had not thought through the
                    implications of modernizing their intermediate range nuclear forces in a way
                    which was such a provocation that the West really had to react. They
                    overestimated their ability to play the Europeans against the United States on
                    this issue and create a deep schism in the North Atlantic Alliance. So I was
                    able to witness in the time that I was in Germany that whole drama going up to
                    the vote and then the initial setback in relations or apparent setback but
                    seeing under the surface that the Soviets were being forced to adjust to the
                    objective realities in Europe.</p>

                        or through intermediaries of the members of the Bundestag? I mean did you
                        get involved in any of this or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, I think there was, particularly those who were on the foreign
                    affairs committee, and defense committee. They were close contacts; we would
                    invite them to our functions. We would try to provide them with information. In
                    a parliamentary democracy obviously we were working most closely with those
                    members of the government who held the cabinet portfolios and the chancellor
                    himself. But there was also a significant public affairs program. Even those of
                    us who were not in USIA would take part in this. I made a number of speeches
                    around the country that may not have moved that many Germans but certainly put
                    me in touch with how things looked at the grassroots level in Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting? What sort of reaction? I mean go
                        down to the equivalent to the local beer parlor, do they often have meetings
                        in places like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, that's true. In my case it was more going to the leadership
                    academy of the Bundeswehr. I'm trying to remember some of the specifics. The
                    Germans would have a lot of conferences, not just for specialists but oftentimes
                    for active members of the political parties and I was sent to some of those
                    events. They were always eager to have people from the embassy explain U.S.
                    positions. It was on some of those occasions that you would confront the average
                    citizens or at least the politically interested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you brace yourselves for real hostility or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: There was some real hostility. I mean, there was a part of the German
                    population that was closely aligned with the Communist Party. I think it was
                    after Grenada if I remember correctly. Within hours of the news of our attack
                    there was a huge mob of Germans with red banners outside our embassy. The
                    Marines all had their fatigues and helmets on and shotguns. We had to wait a
                    couple of hours that day before we could leave the embassy because the
                    assumption was that our safety would be endangered by trying to get through this
                    crowd of angry Germans. So there was that element of the population. A lot of
                    the response to speaking events was more along the lines of the Germans
                    complaining in sorrow about U.S. insensitivity, and one of the frequent lines
                    was the U.S. had no idea what war was like and that Germany did. It had fought
                    two of them, and one of them was fought very much in Germany, in the cities and
                    towns. So a lot of it was in a tone of people sympathetic to the U.S. but
                    frustrated with U.S. policies and U.S. insensitivity about issues. There were
                    occasional sharp dialogues about the cynicism behind U.S. policies. They didn't
                    believe that we really wanted an arms control outcome. Then there were a lot of
                    good, objective, polite questions. So when on those occasions when I would go
                    out it really covered the full spectrum. It was hard to say if I would just meet
                    angry farmers with pitchforks or whatever. It was the kind of forum that I
                    suspect a foreign embassy person would get in the United States on the Iraq war
                    with expressions of frustration and anger over why the Europeans weren't getting
                    on board. It was that level of discourse.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you left there in 1985. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I went to Ambassador Nitze's office. He was Special Assistant to the
                    President and the Secretary of State for Arms Control. Nitze had taken that
                    position after heading the U.S. delegation at the INF talks. I guess he moved
                    back to Washington after the negotiations were suspended following the German
                    vote and the deployment. He really became much more the advisor to George Shultz
                    than the advisor to the president although both were in his title. In putting
                    together a small office of special assistants, he wanted to include in that
                    group people who were very knowledgeable about Europe. So I was basically
                    recruited. Right after I decided on a fourth year in Germany because it was a
                    great job and Bonn was a great place to be, I got a call from Nitze's
                    administrative head who said that he wanted me in Washington. I protested. I had
                    just agreed on a fourth year and it was out of cycle. I didn't know how that
                    would go over in the embassy. Of course I was being very na�ve about how easily
                    someone called the Assistant to the President/Secretary of State can break
                    assignments. It was no problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you did this from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: So I did this from the summer of 1985 to the summer of 1986. It was a
                    one-year job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Nitze stand within the administration at this
                        point, particularly with the President and the White House and the State
                        Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: One of the great ironies was that Nitze was perceived as a dove in the
                    Reagan administration. Looking at Nitze's whole career, he might be seen as
                    being similar to a number of kinds of birds but never a dove. The reason he was
                    perceived as a dove was because Richard Perle — feared and feared correctly —
                    that Paul Nitze was someone who was results oriented, and, if he would be made
                    negotiator, he would then want to negotiate an agreement — not any agreement of
                    course. It would be an agreement that would have to meet Nitze's severe
                    standards for defending U.S. interests. But Perle was right. Nitze would take an
                    impossible position and turn it into a “walk in the woods” solution, which was
                    both consistent with U.S. security objectives and bold under circumstances that
                    no one would have predicted could have been possible. There were those in the
                    White House and certainly the Defense Department who were very hostile to Nitze
                    and saw him as a threat to their agenda, which was a very tough, no-holds barred
                    kind of approach to the Soviet Union. It's very important to realize the
                    fragility of Nitze's standing in the U.S. government to understand what happened
                    farther down the line when, for example, Nitze supported the White House
                    reinterpretation of the ABM (anti-ballistic missiles) treaty, in what was I
                    think one of the low points in Nitze's career since he knew better. But he was
                    in a very vulnerable position. So he was in a great position with the Germans.
                    He was in an excellent position with George Shultz, Secretary of State, who
                    thought extremely highly of Nitze and who relied heavily on Nitze's advice on
                    arms control matters. That's one of the things that made it such a pleasure to
                    be working in that office because just the knowledge that the Secretary of State
                    took Nitze into his confidences and relied heavily on him was very heady stuff
                    for those couple of us who were special assistants.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk about working with Paul Nitze. How did he operate in
                        this particular time frame?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Nitze was someone who kept a Monday to Friday schedule, who would not
                    come in on Saturdays unless there was something urgent that had to be attended
                    to. He was already in his seventies so that's perhaps understandable. But it was
                    not consistent with everything else in the crazy State Department culture. I
                    mean, everyone went in on Saturday in a hot office because business continued
                    six days a week and that's what people did. Some of us special assistants often
                    came in over the weekend too, but you didn't have to worry about looking bad in
                    front of your boss because he wasn't there for the most part. Nitze was so
                    impressive in so many ways. He was a get down to the basics person and was a
                    fantastic note taker. He would come back from a meeting with penciled notes, and
                    he could kind of read back to us like verbatim coverage of what was said in a
                    meeting. He would give us his notes to read. His writing was legible. Things
                    like that I thought were very impressive. Nitze maintained a wide variety of
                    contacts that he had developed over the years so that he was constantly getting
                    inputs, not through just the normal channels, but from some people on let's say
                    the fringes or who were kind of eccentric or kind of out of the mainstream.
                    Nitze would appreciate intellects. He would appreciate arguing with people. He
                    had a steady stream of people like that coming through his office. He also had
                    Strobe Talbott coming to his office fairly regularly. I think those meetings
                    were the basis of Talbott's books—</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Strobe Talbott at the time was—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: He was with Time Magazine, just a journalist who ended up writing what
                    are probably the best pieces of diplomatic history on the nuclear arms control
                    talks in the Reagan administration. I think that probably the ground rules at
                    the time when Nitze was talking to him fairly regularly were that none of this
                    could be published until some future point. But it ended up with a lot of very
                    good inside reports on what was going on. So, of course, we appreciated very
                    much that Nitze would share with his small staff, what was really a maximum of
                    three, conversations with George Shultz or meetings with the president. Nitze
                    was also professional in that he played things close to the vest. I mean, if he
                    would tell us things that other people said that would make people normally roll
                    their eyes, Nitze would not roll his eyes. He would give it to us straight
                    without comment. So in that respect he did not tear down those people for whom
                    he worked. He would just make sure that those who were working for him knew what
                    the context was and what we were doing. So I ended up respecting him greatly for
                    his contributions of intellect, in his particular roll in this particular
                    administration. In spite of his very disappointing participation in what was
                    basically a fraudulent sell to the American public about what the ABM treaty
                    meant. This was one of the ways in the Reagan administration he made policy. He
                    made speeches, which we got clearance on, and no one else was articulating as
                    deeply and articulately what our policy was as Nitze. So then it gradually it
                    became policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now during this '85-'86 period, what were the issues
                        that he was dealing with? The Soviets had walked out, and we didn't know it,
                        but they were waiting for the Gorbachev-Shevardnadze team to assert their
                        control.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Well, at that time the negotiations resumed, and our delegation was
                    headed by Mike Glidden who had been Nitze's deputy in the INF, the State
                    Department representative on the delegation. So there was a close relationship
                    there, and Nitze was basically the great eminence back in Washington, the grand
                    strategist on, not just INF, but also on strategic arms control and the adviser
                    to George Shultz. So the negotiations resumed. The real drama in Washington
                    during the year period was on the ABM treaty. This was basically a story of
                    Richard Perle hiring a New York lawyer who had no experience in arms control but
                    as a hired gun who would go back in the negotiating record, and deliver the
                    results that Perle wanted, which is to say that lo and behold we did not get the
                    anti-ballistic missile treaty which we thought we had gotten from the Soviets
                    and which the Soviets acknowledged giving to us. So Perle's lawyer came back and
                    said, “Oh no actually there's no restrictions on what the U.S. does in space in
                    testing exotic technologies like lasers and everything.” I have this very vivid
                    memory of coming back from this astounding meeting when Perle rolled out his
                    legal analysis and his startling news and telling Nitze about it. Nitze was
                    quite upset to hear that and actually very impatient with me. I mean, it was a
                    classic case of shooting the messenger and delivered as a not so polite tutorial
                    on what the ABM treaty actually says about systems based on other physical
                    principles including getting out the treaty, reading it to me, and telling me
                    what he, Paul Nitze, had negotiated with his Soviet counterparts since he was
                    one of the principal negotiators of this treaty. I was sort of cowed, I mean
                    it's bad enough to have to be told about what a treaty means but even more
                    degrading in a way by the person who negotiated it. But then sadly over the next
                    month, and I know because I was involved in being Nitze's mouthpiece at various
                    meetings in terms of interpretations and talking points and Qs and As, Nitze's
                    position evolved very rapidly from that lecture to me and then one month later
                    when he was saying what the treaty meant. I don't think that it was Nitze being
                    convinced about the negotiating record, but Nitze responding to what the
                    political situation was and his vulnerability with the White House if he got in
                    the way of what they wanted to do. He was also visited by and influenced by the
                    legal advisor to the State Department whose name escapes me at the moment, but
                    who was also a good friend of Richard Perle, who did a number of things for
                    Reagan including persuading the State Department lawyers to view that dropping
                    mines in the harbor of Nicaragua was not inconsistent with international
                    law.</p>

                    <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All of a sudden torture is all right, this
                        reinterpretation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, that's right. Well, anyway, he met frequently with Nitze. But I
                    was sort of convinced that Nitze intellectually bought the case here. But I
                    think what Nitze saw was an opportunity for using this as leverage with the
                    Soviets. I think in Nitze's mind this is something you concede later in
                    negotiations. You have this bizarre interpretation being propounded as high as
                    the president of the United States, and then all of a sudden you've got a new
                    bargaining chip. You've got a new reality that you can play with the Soviets.
                    What Nitze wasn't expecting was this was all behind the scenes. What Nitze
                    wasn't expecting was that Bud McFarland, the president's national security
                    advisor, would actually announce to the public on a Sunday morning news program
                    what the new U.S. position was. Then all of a sudden Nitze had to start doing
                    major damage control to avoid this turning into a catastrophe with our European
                    allies and the American public and the Congress, who, if they delved deeply
                    enough into it, would know that this was basically a fraud. So Nitze very
                    quickly kind of recaptured the public control of the issue so that the
                    administration position became, “well, even though we have a legal right to do
                    these things, we're not going to do them right now.” So Nitze tried to at least
                    maintain the negotiating leverage with the Soviets without the vulnerability of
                    drawing so much fire on this wacky interpretation. It was certainly impressive
                    issue crisis management by Nitze to do this, but even more impressive was what
                    was being done in parallel on the U.S. strategic defense initiative that was
                    just getting seriously underway then by the administration. Nitze using all of
                    his Defense Department and systems analysis expertise managed to work into his
                    speech what then became part of the Holy Grail of U.S. administration policy —
                    that we would only deploy strategic ballistic missile defense systems that were
                    cost effective at the margin. Any sober analyst on this subject knew this would
                    never happen because you were never going to make it cheaper for the United
                    States to deploy a strategic ballistic missile system than it is for an opponent
                    to add the nth nuclear weapon to overcome that system. So this was really a
                    masterful piece of jujitsu. By Nitze getting this into policy it then became
                    something which stuck in the craw every time the Pentagon tried to do something
                    on SDI because they constantly had to confront—</p>

                <p>THIELMANN: Strategic defense initiative. They constantly had to confront that
                    damned Nitze criterion that they couldn't in the rational world really overcome.
                    So he really planted the seeds of destruction in the whole star wars effort.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were you there at the time when Reagan made the star
                        wars speech?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Well, that was 1983 and so I was I guess in Germany at the time.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How seriously were we taking this? A lot of people were
                        saying, the thing is still around today, of having an anti-missile system.
                        How seriously was this thing taken?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: My understanding at the time when Reagan gave this speech in March of
                    1983, was that Weinberger and Perle were not in favor of missile defenses. No
                    one in their right mind was in favor of this because it wouldn't work. The
                    scientists knew it wouldn't work.. The U.S. had gone this route before, spent
                    billions, and ended up with a deployed system in North Dakota: the Pyramid of
                    the Plains. The system was operational for about eight or nine months and then
                    shut down. So even though the ABM treaty allowed the U.S. to have a hundred ABM
                    interceptors, we never exercised it because it made no sense for us. Reagan gave
                    the speech, nothing happened for a year or so. But eventually the conservatives
                    saw this was a great advantage in helping sabotage arms control. Then there was
                    some true believers that thought it would actually work. Richard Perle didn't, I
                    think. A lot of the people were just cynical about it, seeing it as just a
                    vehicle to destroy arms control and sabotage relations with the Soviet
                    Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were there, did you get any feel for
                        the relationship between Paul Nitze and Caspar Weinberger? I mean, the
                        relationship between George Shultz and Weinberger is pretty well documented.
                        They didn't like each other from way back.</hi>

                <p>THIELMANN: I'm sorry between whom?</p>

                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Oh right, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This went back to California days, but what about dealing
                        with Weinberger. Did he come into the picture?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I don't remember too much about Nitze and Weinberger. I don't think
                    they had very many personal dealings and just because of the hierarchy and the
                    fact that Nitze was working for Shultz and Perle was working for Weinberger, and
                    Weinberger delegated enormously to Richard Perle. I mean Perle was an assistant
                    secretary of defense who reported to Undersecretary of Defense Freddy Clay, but
                    for all practical purposes he was the secretary of defense on these issues. I
                    mean he decided the issues and Weinberger backed him up. So the real personal
                    interaction was always between Perle and Nitze. I don't really know — I
                    certainly saw no evidence that Nitze had any respect for Weinberger's Defense
                    Department management or his intellectual contribution.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Perle at that time known within the State Department
                        as the Prince of Darkness?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Absolutely. It was partly because of his dishonesty and lack of
                    reliability in personal dealings that he had that point of view. He was seen by
                    many as being more representative of the Israeli government than the American
                    government. This is someone who is a saboteur of arms control and a totally
                    unreliable interlocutor. There was a funny incident though that I remember back
                    from my time in Bonn. Perle was very, very persuasive and articulate on
                    television and in public. He was not a screamer. He was very calm. He was
                    rational. He expressed himself very well and had a sharp wit. There were a
                    number of cases in which spouses would hear their well, mostly husbands complain
                    about this guy Perle coming back from the bureaucratic battles fields of
                    Washington. Then their spouses would see him on TV or whatever and say, “Well,
                    what are you so upset about? He seems reasonable to me.” Even in Bonn when Perle
                    was visiting the embassy and sitting around a table next to Ambassador Burns.
                    Perle was on one side and I think Root Phelps was on the other side. Ambassador
                    Burns at one point had the terrible indiscretion to turn to Phelps and say
                    something like, “Well, Mr. Phelps, I've been talking to Mr. Perle here and he
                    doesn't sound so unreasonable to me.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about the White House, the national security
                        counsel and just the White House, the White House quote/unquote. When you
                        were there, was this an element that Nitze dealt with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Well, he had to some. There were two people, I think I might have
                    misspoken his name but General Schweitzer in at least the first year or two of
                    the administration had sort of a dual management of these issues. You would go
                    to meetings, and you'd have General Schweitzer and Sven Kramer. They were the
                    two National Security Counsel representatives who would attend all these
                    meetings. Both of them had very ideological, and by current standards I think,
                    rather extreme views on these issues. They were really the faces of the NSC. The
                    actual national security advisers first Richard Allen and then Judge Clark, they
                    were not heavy hitters. They were not really engaged that much in these issues.
                    So you really had these assistants, NSC assistants who were trying to control
                    issues with Richard Burke representing the State Department and Richard Perle
                    representing the Defense Department. Then everyone was sort of battling for the
                    mind of Ronald Reagan who didn't really understand the issues and what was
                    happening. That was kind of the lineup that I remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it sounds like there was a time when it really did
                        allow strong-minded people to seize control of power. I mean as we've found
                        with Ollie North—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes. Very good example.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, when you have a president who is detached at the
                        top, who's not so — doesn't really care for control — it allows a bunch of
                        people to start running around doing things on their own because of their
                        strong beliefs. At the time did you have that feeling that nobody was really
                        in charge?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, I did have that feeling. It was like the policy was made instead
                    of coherently it was made by what speeches you could get out, what words you
                    could use and kind of Byzantine maneuverings and sort of sending something over
                    to NSC and hoping that they wouldn't block it or they would endorse it somehow.
                    But you never knew who was endorsing it. I'm not sure when Poindexter took
                    charge of it. But this whole period, when Reagan was allegedly head of the
                    national security establishment, decisions were being made by many people and
                    not the president. You didn't really get a sense that the president had a firm
                    hand on the rudder.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in your role as a special assistant, did you have
                        contacts over at the NSC who were telling you, “hey this seems to be coming
                        down the track,” or something like that or weren't you part of the
                        process.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Well, I seem to remember that I would get on the phone with Sven
                    Kramer or see him at meetings. That was sort of the face of the NSC to me, not
                    the national security advisor.</p>

                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Then actually in the foreign service I had decided not to extend a
                    second year partly out of frustration. Nitze still seemed to be on a losing side
                    of various issues there. I kind of saw the limits of what I could do and wanted
                    to do the next ambitious thing in the foreign service, which is to bid on a job
                    in embassy Moscow, be the political military affairs officer. I did that, was
                    assigned to it, but this was, I'm trying to remember now whether I had known
                    that or not. What I did immediately after Nitze was to go to the Pearson Program
                    to the Hill to work in the office of Senator Tom Harkin. I guess I'm remembering
                    that it was actually only during that year that I bid on the Soviet job. So when
                    I left Nitze, it was only to go to work on the Hill in the Pearson Program. In
                    the back of my mind it was an opportunity to atone for my sins in misleading the
                    American people on star wars, which I was able to do by working for a liberal
                    Democratic Senator, Tom Harkin, as his legislative assistant for defense
                    issues.</p>

                <p>THIELMANN: From Iowa.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From Iowa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Which is my state, which meant it was a very convenient comfortable
                    position since I didn't feel that anyone in the office cared more about the
                    state than I did even though I was sort of the strange foreign affairs officer,
                    a visitor from another planet.</p>

                        you saw at the time. You did it for a year and then we'll move on.
                        Great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is the 11th of February, 2005. Greg, okay. Senator Harkin — tell me what
                    was your impression. We'll talk about that year. This is when? This is
                    nineteen—</p>
                <p>THIELMANN: This would be 1986, 1986 to '87.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What piece of the action were you given?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: When I first spoke with Harkin's office, I took the initiative because
                    Iowa was my home state, and I had had some previous experience with the
                    Democratic Party in Iowa. At that time there was one person who was covering
                    both foreign affairs and also defense issues for Senator Harkin in a legislative
                    assistant position. So the incumbent felt that this was a pretty heavy load,
                    and, after a short talk, he thought that it would be great if I would in effect
                    worry about the defense issues side of his portfolio. I think his heart was in
                    the foreign affairs side of it. Most of the work was in the foreign affairs
                    side. So he saw that as an attractive way to take care of part of his
                    responsibility. Although I was professionally coming out of the foreign affairs
                    sector, much of my work had been on political-military issues and arms control
                    issues, it seemed like a good fit for the office as well. So my official title
                    really was congressional fellow. That's what I think was on my card. In foreign
                    service terms, Pearson Program Fellow. But for all practical purposes I was
                    Harkin's LA or legislative assistant for defense issues. I felt very fortunate
                    doing that because many of my Pearson Program colleagues would go into a staff
                    position on the foreign affairs committee or usually that. Sometimes they would
                    rotate through other positions briefly. But I could in effect for the entire
                    legislative cycle, the entire year, assume full responsibilities for defense
                    issues, meaning that I would help provide guidance to those people who would
                    answer correspondent mail on defense issues. I could take the initiative
                    proposing legislation on certain issues. I could write speeches for Senator
                    Harkin on anything related to defense issues and then participate in those
                    various meetings among other staffers when they would try to devise strategy to
                    either frustrate the administration purposes or guide legislation. So it was a
                    very rich year for me, and in some senses it was good for my soul since I had a
                    lot of cognitive dissonance on certain elements of the Reagan foreign policy,
                    specifically on arms control about which the Reagan administration was very
                    skeptical. On many of the specific assessments that the Reagan administration
                    delivered on the threat, the way it characterized Soviet military power and a
                    lot of the specifics about the way the world was, was from my personal
                    assessment simply dead wrong — not an accurate description of the world. It was
                    more comfortable for me actually writing from the perspective of this Democratic
                    liberal senator about U.S. defense policies in that era.</p>

                    classic case of exaggeration, hyperbole, distortion, some things that were just
                    flat untrue. Obviously we can do that now with the benefit of hindsight as
                    Soviet archives open up, and we can be a little bit more objective with
                    distance. But on a number of issues whether it was the range of the backfire
                    medium range bomber, which was represented by this crowd as being a
                    intercontinental heavy bomber and therefore something which the fatally flawed
                    SALT treaties had left out. Of course we found out, as many people in the
                    intelligence community said at the time, this was a medium range bomber. There
                    was another bomber coming out — the blackjack bomber which was a heavy bomber,
                    an intercontinental bomber. So that was a case of, to put it charitably, a big
                    mistake or, less charitably, a deliberate misrepresentation, even when the
                    administration correctly described a violation of the anti-ballistic missile
                    treaty. The Soviets were building a large phased radar at Krasnoyarsk, Siberia.
                    This was indeed a violation, but the administration said that this violation
                    proved that the Soviets were breaking out of the anti-ballistic missile treaty
                    restrictions because the treaty allowed such radars only to be at the perimeter
                    and oriented outward of the Soviet Union. Well, the real reason we know now that
                    they built it where they did in the interior was not so much to enable them to
                    have a ballistic missile defense, but rather that was where the edge of the
                    permafrost was. The construction would be much greater elsewhere, which doesn't
                    mean they shouldn't have been taken to task for the violation. But the
                    conclusions that were drawn from this were just one of the many conclusions that
                    Weinberger and the Reaganauts used to argue that the Soviet Union was in
                    lockstep march toward world conquest and wanted to use its enormous superiority.
                    I mean one of the Reagan lines at the time or at the beginning of his
                    administration and during his initial campaign in 1980 was that the Soviets were
                    engaged in the largest strategic arms build up the world had ever seen. Well,
                    objectively speaking that wasn't true at all. The largest and most dramatic
                    strategic build up the world had ever seen was in the Kennedy administration
                    when we were simultaneously deploying Minutemen missiles and Polaris missile
                    submarines and modernizing our bomber force. I mean, that was far more dramatic
                    in terms of its simultaneous modernization than anything the Soviets were doing.
                    The Soviets were in a lot of ways just playing catch up with the American
                    warhead numbers. So there was great frustration on my part while in the
                    administration to have to repeat and justify and elaborate on all these
                    extremely exaggerated claims. Working for Harkin I could point out some of the
                    exaggerations, speak more factually and put in perspective what was going
                    on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find working for Harkin was in a way well
                        placed because, and correct me if I'm wrong, Iowa was not, is not like
                        Florida, California, Texas, Virginia or some place with a huge military
                        complex in it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: That's exactly right. One could argue that Iowa senators are not going
                    to be objective about ethanol, and likewise one could argue that the senator
                    from Virginia is not going to be very objective about building submarines or
                    aircraft carriers. Iowa had one of the lowest receipts of the federal defense
                    dollar of all states. That obviously allowed Harkin some room in his
                    argumentation. In general Harkin was for spending less money on defense than,
                    let's say, the average member of Congress, and yet Harkin was a former Navy
                    pilot and someone who actually during the Vietnam war flew damaged aircraft out
                    of Vietnam to repair bases elsewhere in the Pacific — not exactly a combat job
                    but not a safe job either. He had the credibility of being a Navy pilot and a
                    veteran, which at least gave him a leg up on some others who had never served.
                    So it was very interesting, and Harkin also had a particular interest in certain
                    aeronautical issues and space issues. So that meant that as a staffer for him, I
                    didn't have to spend as much time explaining how things work or what things do
                    as other staffers might. Harkin seemed to trust the general thrust of my
                    thinking on defense issues and trusted that I could represent him in his overall
                    outlook. As a result of that trust, I was allowed to draft a series for Iowa's
                    largest newspaper, the Des Moines Register, on what the U.S. defense policy
                    should be. I think I was actually useful for giving Harkin some credibility
                    among those who would be inclined to represent him as a knee-jerk liberal who
                    was opposed to all defense spending. And for being able to articulate for him an
                    approach to defense which called for increases in some areas and a coherence in
                    our spending and our defense posture, which did not put U.S. defense policy at
                    cross purpose with some of the other objectives of the government. That was very
                    satisfying and I think worked out very well. Then there were some other I guess
                    serendipitous events in which because I was in the foreign service and not
                    knowledgeable about the way the State Department worked.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>At that time the State Department was not represented with any offices on the
                    Hill. In startling contrast to the Pentagon, for example, which had fully
                    staffed offices on both the House side and the Senate side and their
                    representatives would roam around asking members of Congress what they could do
                    for the congressmen. “Can we fly you to Europe? Can we fly you some place? Can
                    we arrange a trip for you? Can we line up your meetings with constituents in the
                    service and that kind of thing.” All the State Department could seem to offer
                    members of Congress was on the phone explanations for why it wasn't the right
                    time to visit this country and why whatever the congressman wanted to do wasn't
                    good for our relations with a particular country. I'm making a caricature, but
                    this is unfortunately the view that many congressmen had of the State
                    Department. So one of the things I could do as a fellow in Harkin's office was
                    at least to relatively easily talk to desk officers and others about the
                    substance behind issues. Oftentimes I would notice members of Congress would
                    want to write a bill to introduce legislation on a particular subject and I
                    would ask, “Well, what does the State Department say about that.” I would get
                    shrugs all around. No one had any idea what the substantive arguments were
                    against something such as whether it was naming the square outside the Soviet
                    embassy Sakharov Plaza, as Iowa's other Republican senator wished to do at the
                    time, or any other policy which would burden the Department of State in the
                    conduct of foreign relations. Usually, it wasn't the member of Congress's
                    argument against another argument. There was no other argument in the
                    conversation of the staffers. So on at least a couple of occasions, I was able
                    to fill that in a little bit without being necessarily an advocate for the State
                    Department but just explaining what the problems were with this particular
                    idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened to the Sakharov Square idea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: The street signs went up I think and it was one other provocation for
                    the Soviets. I was a big fan of Sakharov. So this was not the worst thing that
                    we could do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: What I did witness was and this came home personally because after the
                    year in Congress I went to Moscow, was to see the way the bugging of the new
                    U.S. chancery there was exploited sort of shamelessly by politicians of various
                    sides. That was another of those issues in which very few people knew what the
                    circumstances were, but it was an extremely attractive area for political
                    exploitation. I mean, the members of Congress were talking about how stupid the
                    State Department was to let this all happen right under its nose. There was the
                    conventional wisdom on the Hill about how the State Department is such a bad
                    negotiator that years ago we got this terrible location in Moscow, a horrible
                    bugged building, whereas the Soviets negotiated a high hilltop position in
                    Washington that allowed them to monitor electronically all these sensitive sites
                    in Washington. That's just one of those many generalizations which on the inside
                    looked entirely different. I mean I knew later as a foreign service officer in
                    Moscow that we were a short walk away from the Soviet foreign ministry. There
                    was a much longer drive for Soviet diplomats going from their new embassy to
                    Capitol Hill or any of the executive parts of Washington. The idea that the only
                    reason to have an embassy in a city is to conduct electronic surveillance I
                    thought was a rather incomplete understanding of what a foreign affairs
                    relationship is all about. So the problem in Moscow was not the location of our
                    embassy. It was certain other problems. But that was one of those issues that
                    was not dealt with substantively.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself dealing with some staffers. I mean
                        here you could see a balance. I mean as I've talked to people who said there
                        was a so-called Soviet Threat. They had some major military formations more
                        or less ready to go in Europe and all it needed was somebody to say go and
                        they'd go. Whether they'd win or lose, there still would be utter
                        devastation. You couldn't treat that lightly. Did you find yourself up
                        against people who maybe were a little too much under the sway of the
                        academic world and thinking maybe as a result of the '60s, “Oh there's no
                        real problem if we only think positively” and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: “Can't we all just be friends?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: You would encounter that. You would encounter people who seemed to not
                    even see those 22 Soviet divisions line up right across the inter-German border.
                    I mean those divisions were not fictional and those Soviet army soldiers were
                    not, let's say, what we found out the Iraqi army was in March of 2003. So you
                    did encounter that but I would have to say on the whole that many of, even
                    though many of my counterpart staffers were young and inexperienced, it may have
                    just been the pragmatism of the folly of taking the Defense Department head on.
                    I'm not quite sure, but they really did seem to operate more in the real world
                    than I might have expected. They weren't sort of academic theorists about these
                    things. They did seem to understand—I'm talking about the people who were
                    opposed to the rapid increases in the defense budget. There still seemed to be a
                    solid core of support for real defense spending.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is an article of faith in some Republican circles that
                        it was a deliberate policy of the Reagan administration to put a lot of
                        money into defense and essentially break the Soviet Union when they tried to
                        meet us. This is part of the reason for the collapse. Was this a theory or
                        idea that's going around at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I think it was much more of an ex-post facto theory. I didn't hear
                    very many predictions in the mid-1980s from the Republicans or anyone else that
                    the Soviet Union was going to collapse. Instead just the opposite — the Soviet
                    Union that the hard-line Republicans presented was this juggernaut, this
                    steamroller, which we were barely able to keep up with. We had to spend every
                    penny on defense just to prevent the Soviets from attacking us or taking
                    advantage of us in various parts of the world. We needed things like the
                    600-ship Navy to be able to come up with a new sort of military, new military
                    leverage so that the Soviets would have something to worry about. We could
                    threaten them with an amphibious assault in the Bering Strait or the Norwegian
                    Sea. It was not that we were doing all this just to provide the final little
                    push for a decrepit Soviet system, not at all. This seemed to me much more of a
                    theory that was developed after we spent the Soviets into oblivion. I have a
                    different take on that. I really think that the belligerence of the Reagan
                    administration and the defense spending increases that the Reagan administration
                    introduced, actually delayed positive things happening in the Soviet Union
                    because it made it very difficult for the reformers like Gorbachev to argue that
                    the Soviet Union was not threatened, that there was a need to concentrate on the
                    grievous domestic requirements of the Soviet state. I mean the Soviet Union was
                    always sort of on a war footing whether because of its own imagination or not.
                    But this just maintained that war footing to have a belligerent enemy where the
                    president would make jokes about bombing the Soviet Union in front of a
                    microphone. I have really kind of a 180-degree different interpretation about
                    who won the Cold War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now what about the Defense Department? Was Richard
                        Perle there at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Richard Perle was there at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I mean you were sort of Senator Harkin's gray
                        eminent sitting behind him. I mean did you get on the Pentagon's enemies
                        list or do you think or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I really wouldn't have played my role to give myself that much honor.
                    I think I have to add that one of the things about Harkin was, even though he
                    had a distinct sort of anti-defense bias or profile, he was, maybe through no
                    coincidence, not on the defense appropriations sub-committee. He was not on the
                    armed services committee. So in some sense he didn't enter the radar screen of
                    the Pentagon. I mean they have to curry favor with or they're most interested in
                    currying favor with those key senators who control Defense Department budgets
                    and are seen in the Congress as being the defense experts. Harkin was outside of
                    that. So he did not have the clout and the weight that some of the others who
                    were members of the armed service committee had. Probably in some ways I might
                    not have been able to get the position I did if Harkin was up and running
                    actually as he is now because he is on the defense appropriations sub-committee.
                    It would've been hard for me to come in from the outside because it would have
                    been a bigger chunk of the ongoing action in his office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What impression were you gaining about the politics of the
                        Senate in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Well, one of the things that I saw first hand which was very
                    depressing was just how much time senators have to devote to fundraising, even
                    in the Senate. They have six years between elections, and yet it was just very
                    depressing to see that every senator had to spend a lot of time on the phone
                    raising money. A big chunk of their job was raising funds. That certainly fueled
                    my own personal thoughts about the need for campaign finance reform because it
                    was not a good expenditure of taxpayer funds to send people to Washington to
                    raise funds for their re-election. So that was sort of one political observation
                    about the way things worked.</p>

                <p>Another observation was how much leverage members of the Congress had when their
                    vote could not be counted on to go one way or another. So in a way the vote of
                    people like Harkin, who operated I would say more on principle than certain
                    others did, was not much up for grabs on as many issues as let's say a Senator
                    Nunn. I don't want to put, I don't want to make this a pejorative comment on
                    those who were sort of straddling the fence. One can arrive at their own
                    judgments about that. There are a lot of issues that are very complicated, and
                    one could argue that people who understand complicated issues can be persuaded
                    one way or another depending on how things come down on a particular case. But
                    for whatever reason that was another way in which Harkin yielded up some of his
                    potential power. Because on many of the arms control issues for example, Harkin
                    saw the value of negotiated security arrangements that were not perfect as being
                    far better than no treaty at all. Other senators who might have left everyone in
                    doubt about whether they were going to ratify a certain arms control treaty or
                    not would have more leverage over insisting that the Senate passed a resolution
                    tacking it onto a ratification act for example. So just to see some of those
                    ways about the way the Senate operated. Also there was a, there really is a club
                    aspect of the Senate and an opportunity for bipartisan operations maybe less now
                    in the highly partisan divide. On this subject, I noticed within the last week
                    an article written by Senator Specter, Republican of Pennsylvania, talking about
                    how he and Tom Harkin Democrat of Iowa were working together on a particular
                    issue. It was a very nonpartisan approach, which was very interesting to me
                    because Harkin is often labeled as a very partisan senator. I got, as a result
                    of that year, a lot of ground truth on the real dynamics of the Senate, how
                    things get done, how staff members can have a lot of influence and how the
                    influence is divided among the actual elected representatives and those who had
                    the time and the responsibility for going through all the details of bills that
                    members of the Senate oftentimes cannot. So a lot of very useful insight and a
                    strong feeling at the end of the year that the State Department was not using
                    their foreign service resources very well because they would send ten of us up
                    to the Hill every year. At the end of the year that was it. Then we would resume
                    our career and do whatever we wanted. I argued in the Foreign Service Journal
                    for example after I got back that it would be much better if the foreign service
                    would have people bid on a two-year assignment related to Congress — one year on
                    the Hill and then maybe one year back in the legislative affairs bureau so that
                    the foreign service could get some immediate payback from that investment. I
                    think the foreign service clearly got payback and a very good investment because
                    U.S. diplomats are much better off if they understand from the inside how the
                    U.S. Congress works. So there was definitely an advantage to be gained whether
                    or not this was done or not. But I always thought they would get maximum
                    advantage to let those people coming back for the Hill utilize right away all
                    the personal relationships they had formed to inform the Department where the
                    opportunities were with members of the Hill. The connectivity was sort of
                    shockingly low. I mean, I spent my year on the Hill with nary a call from anyone
                    in the State Department. I mean, I would reach out to get information, but no
                    one would ever call me and ask what's going on in the Senate. Obviously that
                    made my job easier in a way because there was no worry about me being a fifth
                    column for the Hill, but it did make me wonder where the Legislative Affairs
                    Bureau was. Why weren't they at least touching base to find out what was going
                    on on the Hill? I think the foreign service could utilize the people on the Hill
                    better than it does. I'm a big believer in the program. I think it's very good,
                    and it should not just be used as a way for members of the foreign service to
                    catch their breath or fill in a year between other assignments. It should be
                    more deliberate.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then in '87 wither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: In '87 I went to Russian language training. So that was one of the
                    nice things about my year on the Hill that I knew from the first that I would be
                    entering Russian language training a year hence and then going to Moscow two
                    years from the time I started on the Hill. That certainty about the future
                    certainly helped me order things better. So in '87 I entered Russian language
                    training in a ten-month program, realizing early on that I was at a certain
                    disadvantage because so many of my classmates had either studied Russian in
                    college or they were coming back from a tour in Yugoslavia with at least
                    three-three Serbo-Croatian or they knew Polish or something like that. So I was
                    really in the minority that had to struggle from scratch — no Slavic languages.
                    Some unexpected marginal benefits were knowing German and having other foreign
                    languages. I mean, as the saying goes, the second foreign language is easier to
                    learn than the first. I found out that interestingly Russian has a whole slew of
                    words and expressions that come directly from German, mostly in the areas of
                    science and war. So there were a few bonus words thrown in at the beginning that
                    I already knew. But it was tough, and I didn't quite make it up to three-three
                    at the end of the ten months. I got that six months into my tour. But the
                    language was a frustration, because, while I got a minimum level of fluency that
                    would allow me to do business in my area in the language, I never achieved the
                    kind of fluency that I would've liked and I think that would've been possible if
                    on the Russian side the security situation would've been different so that there
                    would've been an easier way for me to plug into the society in which I was
                    living. Diplomatic security in Moscow kept us from receiving any Russian
                    television, for example. They wouldn't allow any cables to go into the embassy
                    compound. We had our antennas, but it was very hard to get any kind of reception
                    of Russian television. So we didn't have that opportunity to enhance our
                    language. There was a conspiracy between the KGB and U.S. diplomatic security to
                    prevent us from knowing any Russian. I say that somewhat facetiously. But in the
                    real world that was a double barrier. Even our Russian language teachers at post
                    at one point were sort of expelled from the embassy. I was going to a Department
                    of Commerce office outside the embassy where we were sort of unwelcome. Then for
                    a while diplomatic security told us we should meet in a little sort of Pizza
                    Hut-like building through which we passed to go into our compound, which was
                    totally inadequate. It seemed at one point when we were literally or at least
                    figuratively told, well, just meet in the snow banks somewhere because we don't
                    want you anywhere near embassy property. So that made it very hard to both
                    solidify and improve the fluency level in Russian.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from eighty—what '88?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: '88 to 1990.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: The ambassador was Jack Matlock. He arrived a few months before I did
                    and then served another year after I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the, in '88 when you got there, what was
                        the sort of Soviet-American situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: It was a fascinating time to be there because in general our relations
                    were improving with the Soviet Union. Gorbachev was in charge. He was sort of
                    solidifying his power base at the time, much less tentative than when he first
                    took over in nineteen, as head of the Communist Party in 1985. It was, in 1988
                    the CIA was still fighting a rearguard action to say that Gorbachev was just
                    like all the others. There was nothing new here. He was just a little bit
                    smarter. Our evidence on the ground from Moscow I think showed a different
                    picture that there were a lot of very encouraging and interesting things going
                    on in the Soviet Union. I was right in the middle of one of the most promising
                    changes in Soviet arms control policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're job, what was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: My job, I was the political section's political military affairs
                    officer. So interestingly that portfolio for a number of years before had been
                    handled by one person. It was handled by one person when I was there. Although
                    during the time when I was there, there was also a new office opening up to run
                    the new arms control implementation functions of having inspectors coming into
                    the Soviet Union and everything. So they had several people on that staff, but
                    it was still one person to engage the Soviets on arms control matters to report
                    on what Soviet thinking was both official thinking and in the institutes that
                    wrote on policy and from which some of the ideas derived. It was an
                    overwhelmingly heavy burden. I mean, early on when I arrived there I said we've
                    got to have at least two officers here to take advantage of the new
                    opportunities that were opening up. Because it was only shortly before I arrived
                    that if the embassy political officer wanted to make a demarche on his
                    counterpart on the Soviet foreign ministry, you would write a letter, say what
                    you wanted to talk about, send it over and then wait for days or weeks for a
                    response. There were all kinds of other meetings that you would arrange with
                    similar difficulty or you couldn't arrange them at all. But during that two
                    years that I was there, everything opened up. I mean, when I was there, it was
                    much like in the arms control it was much like serving in a western European
                    embassy. I would call up the phone, ask to talk with my Soviet foreign ministry
                    counterpart, request a meeting, often get it the same day, walk down the street,
                    go into the office and conduct business.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean there's a story that I've heard from several
                        sources at some of these arms control meetings between the Soviets and the
                        United States that we would say well, we understand that you have so many
                        war heads and you have this and that. The Soviet military would sort of get
                        white and basically go over and say, “look, our people, these civilians over
                        here, aren't cleared to have this information” even though we had gotten it.
                        They weren't passing it on. So my question is how well plugged into the
                        Soviet military affairs were your counterparts in the foreign ministry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: This evolved over time. It's certainly true that it was frustrating
                    from the point of view of a military specialist at the State Department because
                    we knew so much more about both our own military force posture and the Soviet
                    military force posture than our Soviet diplomatic counterparts did. So in a lot
                    of ways it was the military that was the more interesting to talk to about these
                    issues. Yet there is a big cultural divide there. The Soviet military did not
                    feel comfortable talking to American diplomats for the most part. They felt much
                    more comfortable talking to their U.S. military counterparts. So we were going
                    through a period of time when one could actually talk with a relative degree of
                    quality from a same general vantage point talking to one of the members of the
                    institutes like Alexei or Bartov, one of the defense specialists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is Canadian-American Institute.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: USA and Canada, and then there was another one, ENEMO (European
                    Network of Election Monitoring Organizations?). I can't even remember now what
                    that Soviet acronym stands for, but there were basically two different
                    institutes that had kind of well rounded staffs on a number of foreign policy
                    and international theater questions. Those people would study our own literature
                    pretty extensively. So they knew a lot about Soviet military forces through our
                    literature. Then through their own means they would buttress that with a little
                    bit of knowledge of the Soviet order of battle. But it was a very fascinating
                    time because of all the new things opening, the new possibilities. As a
                    mid-level foreign service officer, much of our work was made more interesting
                    and new opportunities created by both Matlock's efforts as ambassador and also
                    the high level officials coming from the United States, like Defense Secretary
                    Aspen who came to the Soviet Union when I was there. He came actually from the
                    East as I recall, going to Soviet test site in Kazakhstan as well as the space
                    launch Cosmodrome, gaining access to ICBM (intercontinental ballistic missiles)
                    sites, all kinds of things that the U.S. had never done before. I also went with
                    Ambassador Matlock to the Crimea for the first visit of U.S. war ships since
                    World War II to a Soviet port. So all those sort of new experiences were there
                    to be reported on and chronicled by political officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What role did the military attach�s play? Were you both
                        working on the same thing or how did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: It actually worked very well in Embassy Moscow. I served enough that
                    I've seen that defense attach�s sometimes don't work very well with their
                    political section counterparts. The embassy in Moscow at least during my two
                    year window seemed to get some of the most impressive officers. There were two
                    generals who were head of the defense unit in Moscow when I was there, first
                    General Rock and then General Gavin, very different kind of individuals with
                    different kinds of strengths but both very impressive representatives of the
                    military who had good contacts, who were respected by their Soviet counterparts
                    and who would have access to a different kind of things than we would have
                    access to. So once we gained mutual respect, I thought it was a very smooth
                    working relationship in which we both sort of specialized even though the
                    overall subject matter was very similar. We both specialized in making our own
                    individual contributions, and I think I feel pretty good about reporting coming
                    out of Embassy Moscow on the Defense side and the State Department side during
                    that period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My impression of that period is “trust but verify,” Things
                        were really changing in attitude. But the whole idea is okay, but we'll go
                        out there and take a look on the ground. I think this would be very
                        difficult for Soviet officials to adjust to.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Very difficult. It was a completely different way of life for them. I
                    mean, they were much more indoctrinated with secrecy and secrecy from their own
                    society. I mean the spending amounts, none of those things were anyone's
                    business except the Soviet military. That meant that when later on, when the
                    Duma was introduced, it was an enormous hurdle to get over the idea that members
                    of Congress should know something about what the Soviet military wanted to do or
                    actually fund it. That was really revolutionary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you arrived there in 1988, was there any
                        feeling about what would happen in the end of 1989? I mean, the Berlin Wall
                        going and essentially the Soviet bloc falling apart. Was anybody saying oh
                        boy, they're on the brink? What were you getting?</hi>
                </p>

                <p>THIELMANN: I think Ambassador Matlock was probably a better authority on this
                    because of his senior position and the kind of correspondence he would have with
                    the top level of the State Department and his being privy to meetings with high
                    level Soviet figures. Not all of that stuff was transparent to us at the time as
                    I've seen from reading some of the things Matlock has written since. I would
                    have to say in general that we did not have a sense of imminent collapse. We had
                    a sense that very important, very significant changes were taking place and that
                    there was some tectonic shifts going on, and I was amazed at the time. I
                    remember being amazed contemporaneously at the kind of things that Shevardnadze
                    would say as Soviet foreign minister. I mean he would say things, he would kind
                    of ridicule the notion, which was really the official Soviet propaganda line,
                    that the NATO countries were looking for opportunities to invade the Soviet
                    Union. I mean, he would more or less say, “Why would they want to do that?
                    There's nothing we have here for them.” He would talk fairly openly about the
                    disaster represented by Afghanistan and the deployment of SS-20 missiles as
                    being things which showed the bankruptcy of the Soviet decision making process.
                    Well, this was incredibly sharp and open criticism. This would be quite sharp
                    for a democratic society let alone the kind of the Soviet society represented.
                    So all that was actually going on at the time, and I think a lot of us were
                    saying that because of all that there were more real opportunities here for
                    making arrangements with and dealing differently with the Soviet Union then we
                    had before. I don't think very many people envisioned the speed with which this
                    would happen and what happened in Eastern Europe in the couple months leading up
                    to the fall of the wall. One can certainly point to memos and other things being
                    done only months before the fall of the wall to document that feeling that this
                    really did come out of the blue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a feeling of comfort with President Reagan at
                        the end of his time and a feeling that here is a man who'd come out of the
                        quite far right in the American political spectrum dealing with the Soviet
                        Union. I'm talking about among you officers there and all that. How did you
                        feel about all this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Well, just speaking personally, I mean I was disconcerted from early
                    on at how little interest Reagan had in the details of defense and foreign
                    policy. So I saw him as representing a profound sort of bottomless pit of
                    ignorance which left me feeling very insecure. The thing that made me feel much
                    more calm about Reagan—and I think this extended to many of my colleagues—was
                    that, once he did develop a personal relationship with Gorbachev, after his own
                    demonization of the Soviets as simply being part of an evil empire and as some
                    sort of broodish automatons as part of this Soviet monolith or whatever, Reagan
                    himself developed a different mental image of his negotiating partners. That
                    made a big difference because one got the feeling that now this Administration
                    at the highest level actually wanted to establish a modus vivendi with the
                    Soviet Union, whereas before it seemed like the administration wanted only to
                    intimidate and vanquish this country. So I think the IMF agreement, the signing
                    of that agreement, and the personal relationship that Reagan and Gorbachev
                    developed made everyone feel a little safer and a little more hopeful about the
                    future directions of policy.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now the foreign ministry of any country usually
                        consists of more sophisticated people particularly in a totalitarian, closed
                        society like the Soviets because they've had to deal with the outside. Did
                        you find sort of a relaxation and kind of a sense of fun and enjoyment of
                        doing the job there among your equivalents in the Foreign Ministry?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I really did. That was one of the most pleasant and satisfying parts
                    of the job. Obviously in the back of my mind was the knowledge about the great
                    divide between the Soviet Union and America. The ideological hostility, the sort
                    of the zero sum notion about U.S.-Soviet relations and all of that very heavy
                    Cold War baggage was in the back of my mind. So it was a special thrill when you
                    thought that you were actually connecting with a Soviet diplomat and that
                    together you were actually advancing the relationship in a way that would
                    benefit both countries and third parties. That was really among the most
                    satisfying parts of my career. I had the good fortune to be dealing with a
                    portfolio that allowed me to engage with some of the most Americanized of all
                    the Soviet diplomats, people who had been engaged with the United States and
                    arms control negotiations previously, some of whom who had served in the United
                    States. Those who had both a good command of English but also — I wouldn't want
                    to overstate this — a more western way of thinking than some of the other
                    diplomats. So I actually went through that time with close contacts with, well,
                    people like Pavel Polischenko the bald-headed face you would see as Gorbachev's
                    interpreter everywhere he went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, the moustache.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: He was actually a Soviet diplomat as well. I would be able to talk to
                    them. With these people I developed a level of trust, which I think is really
                    the prerequisite for effective relations between diplomats. Not to say that one
                    would share all of ones secrets but enough understanding and information that
                    you could rely on what they were saying about making arrangements, or if you
                    could get insight into what the real reasons for a country doing something was
                    going beyond what you were reading in the paper, that kind of relationship. So
                    that was something that I really treasured from the experience, and then of
                    course there was what we would call the “institutniki,” the people at the
                    institute, Alexei Bartov, Andrei (inaudible) who were more or less
                    contemporaries in terms of age and had similar professional interests. That too
                    made it a special relationship. I had my fortieth birthday party in Moscow and
                    was able to invite professional contacts to a birthday party in the American
                    embassy compound. I actually felt I was inviting friends who were representing
                    the Soviet government as well as people who were important for me to have as
                    contacts. That just is a little parenthetical aside. That party apparently
                    created fits for the diplomatic security because they were very worried about
                    any Soviet visitors committing a technical attack on the American compound even
                    though our instructions were that we should assume that everything from our
                    bedrooms to our houses was all bugged on the compound. So I don't know if they
                    were worried if the Soviets were going to change their batteries or something,
                    but we actually had to escort them to the bathroom and everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This sounds like in a way you were almost viewing the
                        diplomatic security as the equivalent to the KGB. I mean it was almost the
                        enemy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: They were working for us, and I did at least have sympathy for what
                    they were trying to do. But I didn't have much sympathy for the way they
                    executed it or their degree of sophistication. I mean we got the strong feeling
                    that diplomatic security would be most happy if we would just shut down the
                    embassy and go home or else that we would never leave the embassy. That is, you
                    didn't get a very strong sense that they understood what we were there for, what
                    our mission was. Obviously their mission was to protect our safety and protect
                    our secrets from migrating to the Soviets, but I would argue an important part
                    of their job too was to remember the prime reason we were there. So yeah, it was
                    at times a not terribly cooperative relationship. I spent a lot of time arguing
                    over who should pay the extra guards hired for my birthday party, and diplomatic
                    security wanted to represent it as something that I had requested. I didn't
                    request it at all. They're the ones who insisted that there be special guards
                    hired and paid overtime to protect the bathrooms while this party was going on
                    and to keep the Soviets from going to the Saint Patrick's Day dance that was
                    just a few feet away in another area of the embassy compound. So we sent memos
                    back and forth about who should pay for this for a long time. It was quite an
                    episode.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I served five years in Belgrade where probably the degree
                        of observance was not as heavy, but it was still there. At a certain point
                        you get to realize how little of what you do really, I mean our phone was
                        tapped and I must say the Serb security service learned a great deal about
                        organizing a Girl Scout troop by my wife in the international community.
                        Most of what we do really is trying to communicate our ideas anyway.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: That's right. If you're having an affair with someone or you have some
                    deep family problem, that's obviously the kind of thing that can be exploited by
                    the other side. But, I don't think that if, as diplomatic security requests of
                    us, any time you want to discuss finances you must be sure to do it in the
                    bubble of the embassy. I think that's going a little bit overboard, and I
                    noticed that, whenever we would want to schedule the bubble, it seemed like
                    diplomatic security was always in it meeting. It was kind of hard to find time.
                    So you have to use some commonsense in these things and realize that, as you
                    say, most of your business is not sensitive at all and not really of use to the
                    other side. Part of being a professional is understanding what is really
                    sensitive and where you have to be careful, talking at home to your wife and
                    others about it. So I think the reminders that many of our conversations were
                    vulnerable to interception were good, but we weren't really given as much credit
                    as we should have been for our professionalism and our ability to use
                    commonsense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was this security a result of the Sergeant Lonetree
                        affair?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Much of it was. That was the whole other element of our life in
                    Moscow, which was much more difficult because of the events that started with
                    Lonetree. The combination of the penetration of the Soviet embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mean the American embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, I'm sorry. The American embassy. The facts of this are still sort
                    of murky. I don't really know to this day how much of it was penetrated, but
                    clearly there had been some connivance between some of the Marines, and some
                    Soviets did get to places in the American embassy they were not supposed to. So
                    the consequence of that and the discovery that the new chancellery had been
                    wired in a way that our technical experts had not anticipated or understood —
                    those two things together left a very sort of heavy security cloud over the
                    embassy and much more stringent demands on us than there would have been
                    otherwise. Then to add to all of that, we had expelled Soviet diplomats from the
                    mission in New York in great numbers a couple of years before I arrived there —
                    at least one year before I arrived. So the Soviets then retaliated by pulling
                    out all of their Soviet employees from our embassy, which meant for a while
                    there we were the only embassy in the world that had no nationals from the host
                    country working in the embassy. Because labor is very cheap in the Soviet Union
                    and there was much to be done, of course there was a lot of work that all of a
                    sudden American embassy members had to worry about. So the year before I arrived
                    there were all kinds of horror stories about diplomats maintaining boilers and
                    doing a lot of manual labor whether it was snow removal or other things that
                    significantly kept them away from doing the jobs for which they had been sent to
                    Moscow. By the time I had gotten there, the U.S. had started hiring contract
                    Americans to come and do some of these critical tasks. For example we had a few
                    American embassy drivers who had some minimal Russian language training. So they
                    were considered secure and could take us around town unlike the previous Soviet
                    drivers that we had to assume were working for the KGB. The problem here was
                    there were very few, and so as a first secretary in the embassy, I always had to
                    drive myself everywhere. This meant, if I had to make a demarche or go to a
                    reception or to one of the institutes, I had to get out my CIA-made Moscow map
                    and get in my Sputnik, my Russian car and drive on roads, which were usually not
                    cleared during blizzards and had inadequate signage and bizarre Stalin-era
                    traffic rules. This required a significant skill and caused stress. That of
                    course only added to some of the other things like even cleaning the political
                    section. We were the ones who had to vacuum, clean windows or whatever else
                    needed cleaning. These private contractors couldn't bother doing something like
                    that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the working conditions. What was
                        happening while you were there in the political-military section?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Because of the inspections opened up under the INF treaty and some

                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: That's right. When I arrived the INF treaty was already being
                    implemented. It was a 1987 treaty. So the unit in the embassy that was
                    interfacing with the Soviets was up and running. We had a port of entry at
                    Ulan-Ude deep in Siberia, and there were American military personnel and other
                    inspectors going in and out and a whole series of exchanges with the Soviet
                    military, which were a new thing. I mentioned the Sixth Fleet visit to
                    Sevastopol, homeport of the Soviet Black Sea fleet. There was a lot of
                    interaction with members of the Soviet military that had not occurred before,
                    and they would be receiving high level delegations in ways that they had not
                    done before.</p>

                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I did some, but even though we had access, I probably wasn't able to
                    exploit it quite as well because I was not in the military myself, not in the
                    U.S. military. My Russian, while adequate was not at the level of fluency that
                    would allow me to, let's say, easily develop a rapport with Soviet military that
                    was already disconcerted by talking to American diplomats and most of whom had
                    no English or no serviceable English. This would all be in Russian.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm not sure when that happened.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I'm drawing a blank on that right now. I was there, I mean, I was
                    recalling the other day in connection with an op ed I was writing about Condi
                    Rice. Before saying some not so nice things about Dr. Rice, I was recalling my
                    accompanying her as a member of the NSC in 1990 to a meeting with Akhromeyev in
                    the Kremlin on a Saturday, a one-on-one meeting, in which I was very impressed
                    by Rice. She was speaking fluent Russian, dealing with Akhromeyev who was in
                    uniform but at that time a special advisor to President Gorbachev. I remember
                    being somewhat amazed that for this sixty-six year old World War Two veteran
                    that he was doing business in Russian with an African American, a young African
                    American woman talking about Soviet military policy. To me it was a credit to
                    Condi Rice that she could establish that level of professional respect by
                    someone representing a macho, racist cultural perspective.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And generational.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: And generational. That's right. So I was very favorably impressed and
                    increasingly less impressed with Condi Rice as the years have gone by.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go down to the Sevastopol visit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: That was an incredible experience. It was incredible because it was
                    not a Moscow event. It was in an enclosed military area. It was an area that had
                    never seen — I mean most of these people down there had never seen — an American
                    in their life. All of a sudden there were hundreds of sailors in white uniforms
                    walking the streets. Then there was even General Greg Govan in a green uniform,
                    a U.S. Army general. Govan was very fluent in Russian. He had a politician's
                    manner. He would walk down the streets of Sevastopol surrounded by Russian kids,
                    and he was clowning with them and joking with them, and it was an amazing
                    spectacle. There were some organized exchanges, I think some sports contests,
                    but just sort of Americans walking the streets and you'd hear these Sixth Fleet
                    sailors saying this was the best port visit they'd ever had. I thought, “What?
                    These guys who sail around Greece and Italy, and this is the best port visit.” I
                    think it was simply because the Soviets were so friendly, and it was such a
                    novel experience. It was like a carnival atmosphere. Of course the U.S. naval
                    attach� had to do a special video for the Sixth Fleet members reminding them
                    about the no fraternization policy, and we heard at the time that there were
                    hundreds of prostitutes coming down to the Crimea for the occasion. Then I did
                    notice late at night as I was going back to my headquarters, there seemed to be
                    at least a couple of American sailors who were walking alone with a woman on
                    each arm. So I'm not sure if the policy was adhered to completely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we've gone through that one before a number of times
                        with complete lack of success.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the events of 1989, because this was a cumulative
                        thing, hit you from the vantage point of Moscow. I mean, was this sort of
                        something, you understood that things were happening. I mean this was going
                        to be a year that would shape the world more or less. Were you understanding
                        the significance of it all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I think — and again my specific beat was arms control and not sort of
                    what was going on in Eastern Europe — but I think as those unusual events
                    occurred in Czechoslovakia and Germany, we certainly took note and this is very
                    significant. But even then one or two months beforehand the breaching of the
                    Berlin Wall came as a real shock. I remember getting a call from my wife in my
                    office in our splendid isolation. Of course we didn't have CNN. Only the Soviet
                    foreign ministry had CNN. My wife said something like the Berlin Wall is
                    falling, but there were people crossing over on the wall and it was so
                    electrifying. It was just an incredible piece of news, and then to see the way
                    it played out from the Moscow point of view was also fascinating. I think that
                    month after that was one of the most interesting of my career because for one
                    thing the political officer who was responsible for following German-Soviet
                    relations was gone. I was his backup. So I was the one who went around to the
                    people in the Soviet foreign ministry who were responsible for relations with
                    East Germany. I would go to events where the East German military attach�s were
                    invited to our defense attach�s. There were good contacts with the Germany
                    embassy, which I maintained. So to see that from all these different
                    perspectives of people whose countries were not only intimately affected by all
                    this but whose lives were intimately affected. I mean, East German diplomat or
                    an East German general officer — I mean these people — their lives as they had
                    known it were coming to an end. So it was an incredible perspective. Then also
                    to realize, again no particular insight here, but to realize how worried the
                    British and the French were about unification. I mean the three parties that
                    seemed to be the most worried were our World War Two partners. The Soviet
                    government, the British and the French were deeply worried about what this would
                    mean. To get that sort of firsthand kind of emotional impression about that —
                    this is something that I think was very important that we reported at the time,
                    to get a sense of how the Soviet people were much less worried than the Soviet
                    government about the consequences of unification. I mean one would have thought
                    from an American perspective that this nation so traumatized by the German
                    invasion and Nazi atrocities would rise as one in opposition and fear to seeing
                    a unified Germany. But I think for us from a Moscow perspective it was much more
                    the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the highest and oldest levels of the
                    government — they were the ones who were panicky. My counterparts of my age and
                    others who grew up in the post-World War Two era, they were not traumatized by a
                    united Germany. A lot of these people had seen Germans too, post-World War Two
                    Germans. The images of Germany as the evil empire were already significantly
                    altered by the reality before the fall of the Wall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Leading up to this time was there any occasion where
                        things were beginning to get wobbly to use a term. Were you, was there
                        concern that maybe the Soviets would move into East Germany because it's
                        really a matter of, will the Soviets move or won't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: I think there was definitely real concern about that. That's one of
                    the things, which I think made everyone's pulse go up a little bit. There were
                    huge numbers of Soviet troops in place. There was always the possibility of some
                    unscripted incident occurring between the German population and Soviet troops.
                    Looking back on it, that was something we were very lucky about. All of those
                    hundreds of thousands of Soviet soldiers heavily armed, sitting surrounded by
                    not so friendly populations and all these countries of Eastern Europe, and we
                    managed to escape the whole thing with not only no incidents, but the Soviet
                    Army withdrew on schedule. I mean that's an amazing thing. So I think we
                    remained tense for quite a while after the fall of the wall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were we looking at the Baltic States? Was this also
                        a place that was a concern to us? I mean what was happening there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: As I remember at the time we weren't quite as concerned about the
                    Baltic States as we became later because the Soviet Union was still intact at
                    that time. The Baltics were fairly well integrated into the Soviet Union — I
                    mean integrated in a sense that an awful lot of Russians lived there. An awful
                    lot of powerful Soviets would have vacation plans in the Baltic. Even at that
                    time it was still hard to imagine the Baltics becoming independent countries
                    when the Berlin Wall fell. I had a trip to Riga, Latvia in my last few months. I
                    think this would have been the summer of 1990. A couple of things came out of
                    that experience. One is just to be reminded again that Latvia was a very
                    different kind of place than the Soviet Union. I mean the manicured lawns, the
                    art deco architecture of the city, the overall Hanseatic League flavor of the
                    city that remained after all this time was so palpable that I remember thinking
                    at the time that with economic opening that whether this country was independent
                    or not, this was going to be the kind of place which exploits the opening and
                    takes advantage of new possibilities here much faster than other places. But to
                    my memory I don't think even at the time I left in 1990, that we were looking at
                    the Baltic States as soon to be independent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was anybody within the embassy, political officers,
                        economic officers, looking and saying, Kazakhstan and all the other stans
                        and the Ukraine, might split up or not? Was anybody even contemplating
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: We were certainly watching things at the time. There were some bloody
                    protests in Georgia that were put down fairly brutally. There were movements in
                    Kazakhstan, anti-nuclear testing movements. There were other things which were
                    clearly creating serious problems for the Soviet center and control problems and
                    manifestations of ethnic and cultural identities that we hadn't seen manifested
                    in a long time. Of course we didn't know where that was going to end either. But
                    again I'm trying to remember what was in our minds when I left in 1990, and I'm
                    not sure then that we had any idea. I don't think a lot of us saw in the
                    immediate future the break up of the Soviet Union. That was still kind of an
                    unfeasible thought even after the Berlin Wall.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this was your first time there, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you also come away with a feeling that God this place
                        doesn't work or did you feel that maybe economically it may not work, but
                        it's certainly a strong, strongly held society through military force,
                        political force, that sort of thing? How did you feel about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I definitely had the feeling that this is a very dysfunctional
                    country. This is sort of a pathetic place that even in the summertime can't come
                    up with decent produce. What kind of a place is it that we bought our vegetables
                    all year round at the Polish frozen food store or ordered things from Stockman's
                    in Helsinki to be delivered on the train. I mean, a city of Moscow's size, a
                    city where there were just starting to be some co-op restaurants where you could
                    get some decent food. It was just starting. But it was still the kind of place
                    where, when we went to Leningrad our first fall there in 1988, the city still
                    had a lot of the decaying splendor of Catherine the Great who built most of the
                    building that remained and the canals and everything, a great potential for
                    beauty and a candy for the eye. But the whole city was just extremely hostile to
                    tourists and had no place to sit and have a tea, no place to walk and get in out
                    of the cold, just that sort of a feeling of just barren wasteland where all
                    these millions of people are living. Then there was a kind of brutality of
                    society. One of my favorite metaphors is right outside the U.S. embassy there
                    was a ring road there with like seventeen lanes of traffic. They had the
                    pedestrian stoplights timed so that people literally had to run across the
                    street. To see like old babushkas with grocery bags in both hands walking who
                    knows how many miles sort of slipping and sliding on the ice across the street
                    before the completely unforgiving huge trucks would gun their way through this
                    intersection. I thought, what a society this is! Then in spite of the fact that
                    there were little pockets of great beauty from the past, there was the
                    incredible ugliness of the housing stock, the decay of everything. I mean the
                    average apartment building's door, the sort of decrepit condition of the
                    entryways, all of this stuff was depressing to the spirit, and one got the
                    feeling that hardly anything really works very well in this whole country.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>Yet one remembers World War Two and the German underestimation of the
                    determination of the Soviet people. One remember the space program. I mean they
                    did beat us in putting a cosmonaut into orbit. They beat us in landing a robot
                    on the moon, I think, or at least the far side of the moon. There were some
                    aspects of the space race that the Soviets did first, and then of course they
                    developed ICBM missiles before the United States and to this day have a record
                    of reliability in their space launch vehicles which exceeds our own. So what a
                    contrast and how hard it was to put the evidence of incompetence and lethargy
                    and decay together with those genuine achievements in the society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then Greg, it's probably a good place to stop. You
                        left there when, in 1990?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Summer of 1990.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: In 1990, I went to the Bureau of Intelligence and Research (INR) and
                    became the division chief for strategic forces analysis, which in a lot of ways
                    was a continuation of my time in the Soviet Union, because our main concern in
                    that job was with the breakup of the Soviet Union — who had their finger on the
                    nuclear trigger? It was of course Soviet strategic forces much more than Chinese
                    or any nascent nuclear power that we worried about. That was our focus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we'll pick this up in 1990 when you're off to INR.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is March 14th, 2005. Greg, how did you find the atmosphere of INR at that
                    time. Were people listening? In general, what was your impression?</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: I had a very favorable impression of INR, once I was inside it. I
                    remember having had occasional contact with INR from the policy bureau
                    perspective. I remember at the time they were obviously the keeper of secrets
                    and had some interesting information, and they were capable people in it, but I
                    did not really appreciate what a resource it was until I was inside it. Then I
                    realized that for example the department had a chair in the intelligence
                    community when the fifteen agencies or some subset of them got together to
                    decide on a national assessment or some lower order of intelligence community
                    proclamation. The State Department was there to put in its interpretation. One
                    of the things that I had not appreciated until I got into INR was that there
                    were very few entities in the intelligence community that did not have what I
                    would call a kind of institutional bias which sort of skewed their assessments.
                    All of the entities of the intelligence community have institutional biases I
                    believe, including INR, but some of them seemed to pose a real threat to doing
                    things that would, let's say, cast a dim light on their own agencies policy
                    proclivities. If I can just put that another way, in the State Department it
                    really did not matter if our analysis was critical of current U.S. foreign
                    policy. This was little understood outside the INR, but certainly inside the
                    building I quickly came to realize that the leadership of the intelligence
                    bureau would fiercely protect the intellectual integrity of the line analysts.
                    So an analyst didn't really have to worry about a judgement or a conclusion that
                    would embarrass the others in the building or elsewhere in the U.S. government.
                    The job was about as objective as one could imagine inside a government context.
                    You obviously had to worry about people continuing to listen to you, and, if you
                    got to be such a nag or if your tone was too snide and everything, you might
                    turn off the kind of policy consumers that you wanted to pay attention to your
                    product. But it was really refreshing to realize how academic in a sense INR
                    was. You were expected to be on top of your product and to use evidence
                    intelligently. But you were encouraged to use your judgement, make a leap when
                    necessary as long as you made clear that this was a guess and that you reported
                    accurately on what the confidence level was based on the evidence available. But
                    it was quickly apparently to me that this was the kind of place where one could
                    go home satisfied in the evening because you had done the best job you could
                    given the evidence available to help policymakers understand what we knew from
                    existing information. Much to my surprise I found out that, in many ways, that
                    was more satisfying than being a cog in the policy machine and very often
                    supporting policy with which you had serious reservations. Although broad of
                    course as the implementer of policy you would also have a heavy responsibility
                    to report what the foreigners thought of the policy or what the situation was in
                    a foreign country. So being an objective reporter of facts had its own
                    satisfaction. But I found that for me personally it was very satisfying to have
                    a few layers between me as an analyst and the Secretary of State, the highest
                    level consumer, and to be in that role of controlling the end result of your
                    output much more than you did as a policy player.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one of the things we'll talk about if the
                        interagency discussions and the biases there. One of the things, and you
                        correct me if I'm wrong, was that in a way State had a certain exclusion
                        from the budgetary process. I'm sure as regards the CIA and the Defense
                        Department an awful lot of their analysis was based on how much money they'd
                        get in order to collect this information, all sorts of equipment and paid
                        sources and all that. Essentially we were doing it with what we had. So that
                        nobody was saying well, if you think if you're knocking our product, what
                        you're doing is you're cutting out a big slice of our budget.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: That's right. That's an important observation about the way things
                    worked. The State Department's INR was on such a shoe string that, if one looked
                    at the billions and billions being spent by the intelligence community, INR
                    didn't even show up as a blip. INR's budget was basically the personnel costs of
                    220 people or something like that. Other elements of the intelligence community
                    would have a big stake in people appreciating and valuing their own particular
                    sources of intelligence information whether it was photographic imagery
                    satellites, signals intelligence apparatus or human intelligence. All of these
                    things were costly, and there would be a bias toward making whatever
                    contribution your agency specialized in seem extremely important. The best
                    example of that I think really is CIA and Human Intelligence. The CIA was the
                    agency responsible for putting all of that evaluatory language on any kind of
                    spy reporting. So any espionage would or should've been labeled in terms of what
                    access that source had, what their record of reliability was and any kind of
                    other information that, while protecting the name of the source, would allow the
                    consumer to have some sense of what kind of information this was. From my point
                    of view that was a really flawed part of the system because the CIA had an
                    institutional interest in praising the value of its sources, and over the course
                    of my career there were a number of times when I saw that those labels were not
                    accurate. This is apart from the whole experience in Iraq where the Iraqi
                    National Congress and others had obvious motives to slant the information. In
                    that case even the CIA often said these sources were unreliable. But I'm talking
                    about sources that the CIA kind of incorrectly labeled. As a foreign service
                    officer abroad there were times when we caught this on information that we knew
                    could not be true. Yet the CIA label is consistently reliable, and in at least
                    one instance we found out it was someone who had left the job a year before he
                    was claiming to still hold it. It was obvious because of what he was saying that
                    this person could not be plugged in, and yet the CIA was not rigorous in their
                    labeling. So to me that's an example of how the institutional interests of some
                    of the other agencies would rob them of objective and hard-nosed
                    assessments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, also too I think that, I'll make a comment on this
                        while we're talking in general terms. INR probably is closer to “what does
                        this mean for policy?” In other words it's really very close to action. Do
                        we change our policy or not? Other ones are the accumulation of data, and
                        the people who are on the intelligence side are not having to ask “what do
                        we do about this tomorrow?” When INR is much closer to the policy
                        development process. Does that make sense?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: That points to another institutional advantage we had over many
                    others. We were so close to the consumers of information, literally minutes
                    away, people down the corridor, a couple floors up, other people in the
                    building. This was an advantage that hardly anyone else in the intelligence
                    community had. DIA (Defense Intelligence Agency) was mostly not in the Pentagon.
                    They were in a separate building. CIA headquarters was on the other side of the
                    river from most of their key intelligence consumers. Those agencies were so
                    large that it would be very unusual for the producers of the intelligence and
                    the analysts to really hear directly from the consumers the reactions to their
                    product. So if there were any reactions at all, it was sort of filtered down
                    through many layers. Their activity would be much more like thrown over the wall
                    or shot in the dark as regards its utility. We had a better sense not because we
                    were better analysts but because of the proximity and the constant contact with
                    the policy consumers. We had a much better notion of what was important to them
                    on a particular day or what was relevant given the overall policy context in
                    terms of our analysis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, another thing and then we can move long. I think
                        size also has a factor because the more people working over something, just
                        means more layers. I'm told that the Jordanian desk in CIA has maybe ten
                        people. The INR desk has one or two at most. You end up with the usual
                        government thing of massaging something, editing it, and it doesn't come
                        out. It gets neutered as it goes through the editing process of too many
                        people going too far. It means that something can be wrong. But it also
                        means, if you just have one person or two people working on something, it
                        comes out as a little more stark, unedited as opposed to one that goes
                        through the bureaucratic process of layers, that takes away all the bite, is
                        safer but not perhaps as valid.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: There are a lot of different dimensions to the truism that small
                    really is beautiful, and it is for intelligence analysis as well as a lot of
                    other things. You've referred to some of the ways in which that's true.
                    Certainly the layering is one way. Whatever ground truth you're starting with or
                    keen insights of the line analysts, if you go through too many layers, you're
                    going to weave around and get a product at the end which may be rather far from
                    the original analytical insight. The CIA in particular had so many resources and
                    such polished presenters in terms of wordsmiths and editors that you had a lot
                    of very glossy products and some good writing in some of those products. But by
                    the time it was ripe for publishing and presenting to others you may have
                    strayed rather far for the ground truth that the line analyst originally
                    developed. That just wasn't the case in INR. Usually the Secretary would be
                    reading words of the line analyst. They were sometimes edited or massaged
                    through an office director or the assistant secretary or deputy assistant
                    secretary but not nearly as much as in the other agencies. So that was certainly
                    one advantage. Another advantage of being small that I came to appreciate at INR
                    was that it's almost impossible to lose sight of the forest because you can't be
                    a specialist in all the trees. It's a very good thing that the U.S. government
                    has specialists on the trees and on small detailed issues, but you have access
                    to them as an INR analyst so you don't need to have that in-house. What you do
                    need to have is someone who can put the various things together and describe the
                    forest. I found that one aspect of that was that my office dealt with technical
                    issues, weapons intelligence basically, political-military things, but it was
                    always in the context of some complicated geo-political situation, about which
                    INR experts were in frequent contact with us and also very nearby. If we were
                    doing something on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction, we would always be doing
                    it with the Near East/South Asia office and the Iraq experts. I think that easy
                    access and frequent interaction on a personal level with those people meant
                    that, even though we didn't always agree with their spin on things, there was a
                    close interaction and working relationship, which in the other larger agencies
                    often became a very formal thing. I think it made us a little bit more nimble
                    and more integrated in our end product than some of the other agencies. Also it
                    had an advantage from a supervisory aspect. The assistant secretary and deputy
                    assistant secretaries knew the people whose product they were editing. They knew
                    the eccentricities of the analysts. They knew who was green and who was mature,
                    who was very careful and precise about language and who wasn't. They could make
                    compensations. I just can't imagine in the larger agencies when you got to
                    something that was going to be published in the National Intelligence Daily or
                    whatever that the editors personally knew the people who were writing the
                    product. In this brief conversation we're talking about three different ways
                    that small size can be an advantage. There are obviously also disadvantages. If
                    one analyst gets sick, INR is in trouble. Usually there is one person who can
                    fill in, but that one person has a lot of other responsibilities. So there are
                    obviously advantages and disadvantages, but when it comes to integrated
                    analysis, self confidence, and fidelity to the evidence, I think it's hard to
                    beat the size that INR had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of INR at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Stapleton Roy was the head. Well, let me go back. Douglas Mulholland
                    was head of INR when I came in 1990. This was someone who had been part of the
                    small Treasury Department intelligence operation under President Bush, I think.
                    So he came over to the State Department. In my second iteration in INR it was
                    Stapleton Roy who had been ambassador to China and Indonesia. And Phyllis
                    Oakley. They were basically, Phyllis Oakley, Stapleton Roy and then Carl Ford,
                    those were all people I served under.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the first time 1990 to when were you in INR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: 1990 to 1993, I extended one year.</p>
                <p>Let me just throw in one other head of INR toward the end of my first tour there.
                    Toby Gati, G-A-T-I, became assistant secretary so I had a very brief period with
                    her. It was mostly Mulholland but then Toby Gati.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Mulholland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Mulholland was a competent person, a nice person. I don't think he'll
                    be in the list of INR greats. He was not a product of the foreign service or the
                    State Department culture, but he was a gentleman and competent so people had no
                    real complaints. If there were any secret desires it would to have had a more
                    feisty or stronger voice maybe in the interagency—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now coming from Treasury was he a sort of Baker
                        confidante.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, he was. Yes, he was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So did you feel that you had—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: We felt that we were plugged into the Secretary because of that
                    association, and that's always important for the analyst to feel that they have
                    an entr�e into the Secretary's office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk now about 1990 to '93 and your job was on
                        the military side. I mean this had to be a fascinating time because we're
                        talking about the rapid demise of the Soviet Union, all sorts of weapons up
                        for grabs and everything else. Talk about your job.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: I was acting division chief because I didn't have the foreign service
                    rank that fitted the position at the time. That job had been one of the most
                    important in INR because it was trying to monitor and analyze Soviet strategic
                    forces, which obviously were the large existential threat to the United States.
                    It was also the office that worried about providing the relevant intelligence on
                    that subject which would be used by those negotiating the strategic offensive
                    arms treaties, the SALT treaties and then the START (Strategic Arms Reduction
                    Treaty) treaties. So that was kind of the traditional main focus of the job,
                    worrying about Chinese forces obviously and other countries that had nuclear
                    weapons as well. It was overwhelmingly Soviet military power. Once the Soviet
                    Union fell, one little dimension of the job really bloomed. The traditional
                    efforts to look at the reliability of the command and control structures and how
                    operationally orders to attack would've been conveyed to the missile forces. All
                    of that which was before a very small subset of the job became much more
                    important as the Soviet Union broke up into a number of different states
                    including Belarus, Ukraine and Kazakhstan, each one of which hosted significant
                    numbers of Soviet strategic forces. So that first tour in INR corresponded with
                    this very delicate period of the U.S. working very hard in a number of ways to
                    try to insure that these four countries with nuclear weapons transitioned to
                    only one country with nuclear weapons. Or to put it another way, the Soviet
                    control over the nuclear weapons would morph into a Russian control over nuclear
                    weapons and Minsk, Kiev and Alma-Ata did not end up having their own nuclear
                    forces bequeathed to them because of the breakup. It was particularly sensitive
                    in the case of Ukraine because Ukraine more than the others had some of the
                    largest and most sophisticated missile assembly plants, had a lot of indigenous
                    expertise on how to make both the delivery vehicles and also the nuclear
                    weapons.</p>
                <p>So the Ukrainians had some real choices for keeping some of those nuclear
                    weapons. What actually would have happened if they had continued along that path
                    or if they had seriously pursued that path, we don't know. Obviously the
                    Russians were very intent on them not having those options, but it was a real
                    concern. There were a number of scenarios that were seriously considered that
                    would have featured war between Ukraine and Russia. Most of those scenarios I
                    think we thought were unrealistic, but that they were even seriously discussed
                    showed what a real crisis this was and what a delicate period of time it
                    was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in a sort of peculiar way we and the Russians were
                        both on the same side, weren't we?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: It was a very curious form of cooperation because we shared an
                    interest with the Russians in ensuring that Russia maintained control over all
                    those nuclear forces. In some respects we rooted for the safe transit of nuclear
                    weapons from these other countries back to Russia so they could then be put
                    online aimed at the United States. There was certainly some irony in that, but
                    it was considered a far worse outcome if we had new independent centers of power
                    that might also have targeted their weapons at the United States. So part of the
                    irony also was that, as much as we wanted Russia to maintain control of the
                    weapons, we genuinely wanted Ukraine to evolve in a western direction and to
                    reanimate some of the traditions that were really alive in Ukraine as a European
                    country. It was much more oriented toward the U.S. than the more Asian-oriented
                    heartland of the Soviet Union was. So we were trying to encourage that. We were
                    trying to get Ukraine to see itself as a country that would be benefited much
                    more by pursuing a German or a Japanese model of obviously being capable of
                    having nuclear weapons but, by pursuing a non-nuclear path, could find a better
                    way to reintegrate itself into the western economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you find dealing with particularly the
                        Defense Intelligence Agency and the CIA on this particular issue? I mean
                        were there any problems or divergences?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: There were certainly some divergences and, while my memory is not
                    terribly sharp on this, I think in general I would like to say we were a little
                    bit more sophisticated in the scenarios that we used. Some of those probably
                    from the Defense Department side of things put more credence in the outbreak of
                    war between Ukraine and, Russia, and when we thought through those scenarios, it
                    just seemed extremely unlikely. I mean for one thing there were so many Russians
                    living in Ukraine. The eastern part of Ukraine was basically ethnic Russian. It
                    just got kind of incredible to think about any scenario in which you would have
                    one of these countries lobbying nuclear weapons at another. So I think, to put
                    it neutrally, it was because we were closer to a more sophisticated analysis of
                    the internal dynamics of Soviet society and the new emerging societies that we
                    weighed the likelihood of those scenarios a little bit differently. One of the
                    other things that I remember about this era is that we received some very
                    valuable human intelligence from some of our foreign allies. Without going into
                    too much detail, I was impressed at the quality of information of one of our
                    special partners in intelligence. They had presumably at much lower cost were
                    providing better human intelligence, more critical useful human intelligence
                    than our own U.S. agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you concerned about rogue scientists in the Ukraine
                        or elsewhere exporting their knowledge of nuclear things to people such as
                        Iran, Iraq and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: That was definitely a constant concern. Even in INR where we had such
                    limited resources, we tried to start keeping track of certain individuals about
                    which there was intelligence. We tried to stay plugged into the other agencies
                    who had the resources to look closely at this because this was seen by almost
                    everyone in the intelligence community as a source of concern that in the end
                    would be much greater than the prospect of Ukraine developing independent
                    nuclear forces. The collapse of the Soviet economy and all those incentives and
                    privileges and everything else that made life for weapons scientists about as
                    good as it could be in a Soviet context led to people not getting paid month
                    after month. The temptations became very great even though in that respect I
                    think those who were not as familiar with the Soviet society maybe saw the
                    temptations as being greater by putting ourselves in their shoes. I think there
                    was for those who were not as close to the way the Soviet Union actually
                    operated, it was just easy to imagine hundreds of thousands of scientists just
                    contracting out to Libya or other countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I mean when one looks at it, one thinks about

                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If all of a sudden the State Department stopped paying me
                        my pension, my God what would I do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I guess they had support systems and other
                        things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: They had support systems and sort of a deep nationalism so that a lot
                    of Soviet scientists would not be particularly comfortable working for the
                    Iraqis or the Libyans, or the North Koreans or anyone else. I say that even in
                    the knowledge that there were Russians and Ukrainians who did just that. The
                    magnitude of the problem was probably not what we might think putting ourselves
                    in their shoes. It was certainly a serious enough concern that we needed to
                    inform the policy people who could actually do something to mitigate that danger
                    and did in fact by aiding some of the labs and the weapons manufacturing
                    facilities to give them another alternative at home for using some of their
                    skills.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Soviet Black Sea fleet because it was a
                        pretty sophisticated set of ships and all that including nuclear missiles.
                        The problem was where did it belong?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: That was another incredible development that occurred as a result of
                    the breakup. Sevastopol, the headquarters of the Soviet Black Sea fleet, was a
                    very Russian city. It was extremely important in the Russian military context.
                    It had this sort of glorious World War Two history as a heroic defense against
                    the Nazi invasion. It was about as rock solid as any Russian city could be, and
                    yet all of a sudden it found itself in the Ukraine. So all those Russian war
                    ships and the Russian personnel were all of a sudden in another country that had
                    its own designs on Russian ships. So that was another messy problem and of
                    course one of the serious irritants in the Russian-Ukrainian relationship.
                    Having been to Sevastopol while in the embassy in Moscow and having seen that
                    firsthand, it was another way in which I suppose I benefited from having been a
                    foreign service officer and our office benefited a bit from that kind of
                    perspective. But we also understood that in terms of strategic forces, the Black
                    Sea fleet was fading in significance, and it almost was almost irrelevant in
                    terms of the strategic impact of the Russian Navy. I mean, it was all the
                    Northern fleet and the Pacific fleet. That's where their sea-based nuclear
                    deterrent was based. So the Black Sea fleet and those military capabilities,
                    during the height of the Cold War had been exaggerated by the U.S. partly
                    because it was good for raising funding. But no one I think ever really saw the
                    Soviet Navy in the Mediterranean as being able to last very long if there were
                    actually a war. So I think the Black Sea fleet in that conflict with Ukraine was
                    of great significance in political terms but less so in military terms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With naval intelligence and all looking at the Black Sea
                        fleet, did the defense people have a sort of a different view? Because as
                        you say it's pretty obvious it's a write off. But in order to maintain
                        enough ships in our Navy you've got to have a threat.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, I think it's pretty hard to ignore that dynamic entirely. This
                    isn't to cast aspersions on the integrity of defense analysts or the Navy. But
                    there's just a natural interest in looking at the order of battle of Russian
                    ships and arguing that we had to have a comparable order of battle matching them
                    cruiser for cruiser ignoring all these things like the bases that ring the
                    Mediterranean with fixed wing aircraft that can attack those ships. It was just
                    a horribly hostile environment for the Soviet Navy in the best of days to
                    operate. I mean they could use port facilities in Syria or Egypt perhaps
                    but—</p>

                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I mean so vulnerable to being bottled up. I mean I would say that the
                    U.S. Navy didn't have an institutional interest in presenting to the public the
                    full dimensions of the Russian problems — what the Soviet problems would be and
                    what the U.S. problems would be if there were an actual conflict.</p>

                        regarding missile control in this Soviet-Russian-Ukraine context during this
                        '90-'93 period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: There were some very delicate moments in which we analyzed what the
                    Ukrainian options would be if they really wanted to seize control of forces, and
                    it wasn't evident that the Russians could keep them from doing it if they really
                    chose to. There were elements in the Ukrainian political spectrum that were
                    arguing for that course of action. So it wasn't just a theoretical excursion of
                    Western analysts. There were real Ukrainians who wanted to do that. I think my
                    memory is that we were a little less alarmist about the prospects of that
                    happening than some in other agencies. We recognized the danger and certainly
                    highlighted it as a danger and treated it as an analytical priority because of
                    the consequences, but we were a little less pessimistic about whether or not it
                    would happen than were some in the other agencies.</p>

                        at that time? I mean in other words for domestic political reasons, you just
                        didn't talk about it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: This was one of those areas in which it seemed to me that the long arm
                    of the policy world stretched into the intelligence world. I remember from that
                    period in INR working on national intelligence estimates, looking fifteen years
                    out at the nuclear powers, I was somewhat amazed at the invisibility in these
                    top-secret intelligence community surveys of world nuclear weapons. It was
                    almost like the Israelis didn't exist. At that point it was really a very
                    bizarre thing because the Indians and Pakistanis didn't have nuclear weapons at
                    that point. We had the five MPT nuclear powers that existed in 1968 and the
                    Israelis. The Israelis had a very significant nuclear capability with
                    sophisticated delivery systems that could for example allow them to attack
                    Ukraine or parts of Russia and a kind of nuclear force that in size was kind of
                    approaching the British and French nuclear forces. Yet it seemed to be
                    politically incorrect to say anything in these top-secret internal documents
                    about Israeli nuclear capabilities. I remember protesting at analytical sessions
                    and trying to push them to a more objective academic look at the issue not
                    colored by the fact that the Israelis had their policy of ambiguity and did not
                    want to admit that they had nuclear capability. I said that's no reason for us
                    not to describe it as we know it. I mean whatever policy the U.S. wants to take
                    in terms of subscribing to Israeli ambiguity we should not be kidding ourselves
                    about the objective realities.</p>

                        to leak and it's sure to bring all hell on the Israeli lobby and Friends of
                        Israel will be all over us? In other words this was not somebody from up
                        above doing it. Where did you feel it was coming from?</hi>

                <p>THIELMANN: I really felt it was self-censorship. Now I wasn't maybe high enough
                    in the hierarchy. Maybe it was more direct than that, but I think it was
                    political savvy — senior intelligence officials thinking this is a problem we
                    don't want to have. We don't want the pro-Israeli lobby coming down hard on the
                    U.S. government because of something that we did here so let's just not talk
                    about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. It really is amazing. Well, what about China? How did
                        we view China at that time, '90 to '93?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: What I remember about that era is that it was so difficult for the
                    intelligence community to not use our own model of strategic forces development
                    in thinking about the Chinese. So what I remember from that era was how strong
                    the other agencies pushed in their analytical product for the assumption that
                    China would have many more strategic nuclear weapons within some number of
                    years, that they would have multiple independently targeted reentry vehicles on
                    each of those missiles and that they would be telling policymakers the Chinese
                    are basically going to take off. One of the reasons I remember that so strongly
                    was because I was uncomfortable at the time since we had seen a history of the
                    Chinese being very modest in their nuclear weapons programs. I mean they
                    acquired nuclear weapons, and then they increased their capabilities at a very
                    slow rate. It was nothing like either the U.S. or the Soviet development pattern
                    — kind of exponential increases in warheads. I remember at the time feeling that
                    I didn't really have enough time as an analyst of Chinese strategic forces to
                    really pound the table too hard on this issue. I remember being skeptical, but
                    these memories came back to me several years later when I reentered the picture
                    and found that lo and behold the Chinese hadn't done any of those things that
                    the majority of the intelligence community seemed comfortable in predicting. But
                    they were still at that same low level of strategic missiles that could threaten
                    the United States.</p>

                        military assumption of a worst case scenario. You can't say the United
                        States will roll over the Iraqi Army in a matter of days practically. You
                        have to say well, maybe such and such, whatever it is. It's always, you have
                        to plan for the worst case. Was this coming through in the what you are
                        getting out of the analysis people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I think that's certainly part of it, and I'm not as hard as some on
                    the worst case analytical predisposition of the Pentagon. I mean I call it
                    responsible prudent worst case analysis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I agree.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: But that's what they need to do. But that didn't mean that we had to
                    do that. The way I would put it, our obligation in advising the senior State
                    Department leadership was to present them with our best estimate of what was
                    likely to happen and not what could in the worst circumstances happen. I mean we
                    can identify that and encourage people not to forget that this most likely
                    course could be wrong and that it could be even worse than that. But that
                    shouldn't be our headline on intelligence products because that's very
                    misleading. If you end up writing products that use screaming headlines and
                    saying this country could do this when that's a ten percent probability, you've
                    fundamentally mislead the Congress and the senior leadership because they don't
                    read that as being something that's very unlikely. So to me that's the real
                    difference. You do need to look at the worst case, but you also need to have
                    perspective properly presented to the policy makers. So I think what was
                    happening here was a reflection of the natural and understandable instincts of
                    the military side of the intelligence community. But then the irresponsible
                    senior intelligence officials who come up with the community products giving it
                    more weight than it deserves and the kind of presentations that are made. I
                    would also say even for those who understandably should look at the worst case,
                    I don't think there was due deference to what the track record was of China even
                    in that 1990 to 1993 interval. They should've drawn some conclusions from how
                    China had behaved in the 1980s instead of just saying well, of course China
                    could technologically develop independently targeted reentry vehicles. In order
                    to provide the sort of U.S. level of protection of their modest force, there is
                    an imperative they increase the number of warheads. I mean that's the way we
                    would think. We would think you assume the worst of the other side so you have
                    to make sure that you can survive an attack that the other side makes against
                    you. The Chinese obviously didn't think that way because their forces in the
                    early 1990s and certainly in later 1990s were getting perilously vulnerable to a
                    first strike U.S. attack. But the Chinese weren't thinking the way we were about
                    that because they were obviously willing to accept that kind of
                    vulnerability.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the powers in this time period of North Korea,
                        India, Pakistan? Was this part of your portfolio?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: It's interesting in terms of portfolio our office in INR was still
                    treating this as something the proliferation division looked at and not the
                    strategic forces division. I was already a little uncomfortable with that
                    because it's such an artificial distinction really. I mean the putative
                    strategic powers or the countries that were emerging nuclear powers or had an
                    apparent intent to continue pursuing that at least had to be something we were
                    looking at because the expertise and the criteria of maintaining strategic
                    forces and command and control and all those things were something that was in
                    the realm of the strategic forces analyst not so much in the realm of those who
                    were worrying about whether this missile production equipment was being
                    transferred or not or range testing or range radars for testing missiles in
                    flight. I mean ultimately there was a merger toward the end of the period of the
                    missile proliferation into the strategic forces, which kind of took care of the
                    problem for me anyway. That was a logical development. But in 1990 to 1993 it
                    was still on the horizon. We knew that India and Pakistan were working on this,
                    but we didn't know in either case for sure that they had made a decision to
                    actually go forward. I'm going to have to take a break.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Were there any either incidents, crises, amusing
                        things or anything like that happening during this particular time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I don't think so. I mean I'm sure there were, but I'm drawing a blank
                    at the moment on whether other developments—. One of the things that struck me
                    about the particular office that I served in was we had a very able office
                    director named Gary Dietrich, and he had a deputy named Alan Locke who I then
                    went to work for later. It was a real sense that this particular office was one
                    of the hardest working and well managed in the bureau. That made an impression
                    on me because it was very easy to compare offices in a small bureau. You would
                    see the office directors represented at morning meetings, and so it was very
                    impressive in terms of the way the office was managed and the recruitment of
                    personnel and everything. I was impressed with this particular office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you ever feel that you were outmanned, outgunned
                        or something at the joint meetings with particularly Defense and CIA?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, we always felt that one of the particular frustrations in INR,
                    and I experience this much more when I became office director, was it always
                    seemed like we were just on the verge of getting the minimum number of people.
                    We could never quite get there. There was always some critical shortage in the
                    office, some critical issue that you had to cover that for one reason or another
                    you just couldn't get people on board. Either security was taking a long time or
                    veteran's preference indicated that you had to chose someone that you didn't
                    want to chose or INR seemed to be always at its personnel limit. It was always a
                    real juggling act to bring someone else onboard, and then there would be freezes
                    and everything. So personnel was a constant problem and the State Department had
                    not been particularly generous over the years either. When it took the various
                    cuts that it experienced over those decades, it was always tempting to shave a
                    few more analysts off of INR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course this is a particularly bad time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Personnel wise throughout the State Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes. That's right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Throughout the government but—</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the State Department was taking quite a hit. There
                        just wasn't the pressure from above. Baker was not very interested.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, that's putting it mildly. I mean, we all noticed it at the time.
                    This gets back to that exact time, 1993, that the Soviet Union broke up, and
                    Baker gained points on the Hill by saying well, we can eat all those cuts. We
                    can established fourteen new embassies, and we don't need more people for those
                    fourteen new embassies. It was an absurd statement and we paid for it in a
                    terrible way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then in '93, you got a new administration coming in,
                        the Clinton administration. What did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Well, that was when Toby Gati came to INR. But what I did in 1993 was
                    to go to the European bureau and get a job as officer in charge of German
                    affairs. I don't know if the position still exists or not. But it was an unusual
                    position in that not very many country desk jobs involved supervision of only
                    one country. As officer in charge of German affairs, I would supervise two more
                    junior officers who worked full-time on West German (FRG) affairs. This was in
                    an office that had previously dealt with all those esoterical issues like Berlin
                    matters but also had the East German (GDR) account and Austria and Switzerland.
                    Then there was also an economics officer who dealt with all of those countries.
                    So in one sense I didn't really supervise all the people who were working on the
                    German issues; the economic operation was separate. The office director and the
                    deputy office director were themselves sometimes at least eighty percent focused
                    on German affairs issues, but it was a job that I liked a lot because at least I
                    had license to concern myself with anything having to do with Germany. It was
                    one of those occasions for trying to orchestrate the reporting out of what was
                    still a significant number of constituent posts for one country. It was in a
                    period of time where some of the new posts, like Leipzig, was very important for
                    trying to keep track of what was happening in this new piece of Germany that had
                    obviously a very different political culture than in the past.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this in '93 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: '93 to '95.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '93 when you took over, was Germany united by this time
                        or what was happening?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: By that time Germany was united, and I'm trying to remember when the —
                    can't even remember what it was called, the Four Plus, the Four Plus Two or
                    whatever — we had these very sensitive negotiations to lay out the reunification
                    or unification of the two Germanys. By the time I got there, it had all
                    happened. I think that there were still some Russian soldiers on their way out.
                    I'm not quite remembering the last withdrawal although I do remember that the
                    Russians kept to the schedule, which was impressive. They got everyone out at
                    the time they were supposed to have them out. But what was happening was of so
                    much interest at the time. There was one Germany. There were these new German
                    provinces in what had been East Germany like Saxony. When I say new, of course
                    they were in many cases returning to a very old political identity, particularly
                    in the case of Saxony. There was Saxony-Anhalt and Pomerania and Brandenburg and
                    so forth. This was just really fascinating for anyone with a background in
                    German affairs to see those old identities and the old way of doing things and
                    even where German companies would traditionally be headquartered. Would the
                    Dresdner Bank go back to Dresden for example? There were all those banks that
                    had moved to Frankfurt and then had the option of locating in Berlin or one of
                    the other places. So seeing how Germany was changing, seeing how the country
                    would share the enormous costs of bringing East Germany and East German
                    infrastructure into the very modern West German orbit was really fascinating as
                    was seeing where the fissures in the society were, the so called Wall that the
                    East Germans still had in the head. The resentment of East Germans toward the
                    sense of superiority the West Germans had and what we would've seen in our post
                    civil war context as carpetbaggers coming from one side to exploit opportunities
                    on the other were also visible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you took it over, did you feel that we were, you
                        might say, overly optimistic about the integration of Germany or did you
                        realize what a tough nut it was going to be. Because as we speak in 2005
                        there's a real divide still there. It hasn't moved together the way that at
                        least I would've thought it would.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: I'm trying to recall the way we thought about at the time. I think
                    some people thought that Chancellor Kohl was too optimistic about it, and of
                    course, he was. Historically speaking, he used certain images about the East
                    German landscape blooming. Some of the entrenched problems of having a whole
                    generation of Germans raised in the socialist paradise model of low incentives
                    to work and inefficiency and all those things were much harder to fix really
                    than things like the transportation and communications infrastructure, which
                    really was fixed in a spectacular way. People have commented that East Germany
                    now has a more modern infrastructure than West Germany does because so much of
                    it is new. I mean that was enormously expensive, and it took years to work on.
                    But you can point to concrete accomplishments there. If you look at what has
                    happened to the human potential and the problem of high unemployment in large
                    sections of Eastern Germany, it's been a real chronic problem and something that
                    unification has not been terribly successful in achieving. So I think that the
                    U.S. State Department's Germany analysts saw very realistically some of the
                    problems that would lie ahead for Germany. I think in some ways the real Germany
                    experts were probably pleasantly surprised at how successful some aspects of the
                    unification were. I mean the Germans and their Germanic way were very thorough
                    with a lot of the things that had to be done. There was in some senses even more
                    of a German identity that was successfully appealed to than some people might
                    have appreciated. So I think the kind of deep problems were foreseen by the
                    U.S.-Germany experts, and if anything there was some pleasant surprise about how
                    successful some aspects of unification went. But it was very important to have
                    people on the ground and in contact with the new political elements and
                    particularly important to have those who actually bridged that chain, the people
                    who served in Germany in the late 1980s and who knew a lot of the protesters and
                    everything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we see politics in Germany at that time, as
                        regards their impact on American policies and interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Well, what I remember most distinctly at the time was the great
                    satisfaction in seeing Germany united. I think I may have mentioned this
                    previously but from a Moscow perspective it was seeing the nervousness felt by
                    France and Britain about unification, and the United States had none of those
                    concerns about a looming Germany changing the power relationship. What was
                    clearly different was the adjustment to a Germany that did not have to accept
                    basically anything that the U.S. security required for existential reasons. Some
                    in the U.S., and I think especially in the Pentagon were slow to appreciate the
                    fact that a united Germany didn't have to accept sort of low flying jet aircraft
                    or tanks churning up their farmer's fields anymore now that the threat was
                    receding rapidly. With an independent Poland and everything, the Germans were
                    just in a very different situation. The United States in my opinion wasn't as
                    adept as it should have been in making an adjustment in our own minds about
                    Germany. We should have more rapidly adjusted our own dealings with them and
                    backed off from the somewhat imperious ways that we demanded cooperation from
                    the Germans.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we seeing a new German in its role in Europe now? I
                        mean, did we see a Germany that was beginning to shuck off the almost
                        subservient guilt of World War Two and say, yeah, we're a big powerful
                        country and we have our own interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I think there was a new Germany emerging, and of course one of those
                    endlessly fascinating aspects of German affairs was to try to say how much is it
                    new and how much is it old. It doesn't lend itself to easy generalizations. I
                    think the roots of the Federal Republic of Germany that emerged after World War
                    Two are very deep. The new unified Germany is a victory for that Western German
                    model. There's no kind of halfway point between East and West Germany. I mean
                    the West took over. We wouldn't usually say it that bluntly, but that's what
                    happened. There are some negative consequences of that too in terms of
                    alienation of some of the Eastern Germans. But I think it's very solidly rooted
                    in the kind of western values that we always wanted Germany to have. Of course
                    it's ironic that the U.S. has taken to complaining about the Germans not being
                    willing to have a large enough military and being too reluctant to go abroad in
                    search of dragons to slay. There is terrible irony in that. So there's obviously
                    some impatience on our part still for Germany not assuming it's full weight as
                    an international actor. But there's also irritation on our part of Germany
                    defining its own interests in any way on any occasion as being different from
                    our own. So it's a little bit hard for us to have it both ways. I mean, what
                    kind of Germany do we want after all?</p>
                <p>But the combination of the German unification and the biological factor of the
                    older generations dying off and Germany being run basically by people who don't
                    have a memory of the war years, and increasingly don't even have a memory of the
                    early post war years of hardship are creating a very different Germany than the
                    previous one. It's manifested in such simple things as watching the Germans at a
                    World Soccer Cup, seeing Germans waving flags or painting their face in the
                    German colors. It's really extraordinary for people who have been German
                    watchers in the post-World War Two era. As harmless and innocuous as those
                    manifestations of nationalism are, the Germans just didn't do it. You'd be hard
                    pressed to find a flag flying anywhere in Germany when I first went there in
                    1969.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>So I see this as Germany becoming a normal country. I think it is most of the way
                    to becoming a normal country, which doesn't mean Germany is avoiding the issue
                    of war guilt. I mean Germany is still paying large sums of compensation for
                    victims of the Nazi dictatorship even though, of course, Germany is often
                    involved in action to limit the amount of payments it has to make. It often
                    finds itself in the role of heavy in those arguments. But, if one takes any kind
                    of a comparative look between Germany and Japan, Germany has dealt with its war
                    guilt and Japan has not fully done so. East Germany has not fully dealt with its
                    war guilt, but that's the consequence of the Communist leadership always blaming
                    it all on the West Germans and saying that they, as the inheritors of the
                    communist resistance, had nothing whatsoever to do with it. But then it became
                    of course no accident that the skinheads and the fascists were much more
                    prevalent in East Germany than West Germany, and in some sense the real
                    inheritors of Nazi fascism are, have their roots in the impoverished part of
                    East Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the role of France and Germany part of your portfolio?
                        I mean there was a lot of effort on the part of the leaders of the two
                        countries to create a solid political blockage. Did that come up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: It came up. I guess I first had a full appreciation of that when I
                    served in Germany in the '80s. The enormous contribution of the real sea change
                    that was achieved originally in the coal and steel community after World War Two
                    brought them into the same economic basket. But also those enormously successful
                    and large-scale exchange programs that brought young Germans and Frenchmen
                    together in the 1950s really fundamentally changed that long standing, kind of
                    instinctive animus between Germans and French. I really think that even though
                    during this period, 1993 to 1995, we saw a fair degree of cooperation and good
                    relations between Germany and France. We're only now years later really seeing
                    the full implications of the German and French working together. We see it again
                    and again in diplomatic reactions or initiatives in which Paris and Berlin are
                    part of the same position often with the United States in some other
                    position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess you weren't dealing with the economic policy or
                        maybe you were as we were moving towards the world trade organization. Did
                        that come across your desk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: That was really more in the area dealt with by the economic officer on
                    the desk. So I noted, tried to cooperate in, but wasn't directly responsible for
                    that part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see Germany extending itself into the east. I mean
                        this is when Germany was unified. One of the thoughts was “oh my God, they
                        will take over Eastern Europe basically economically and eventually sort of
                        politically because they're well positioned compared to the rest of the west
                        and also have the power.” Is this something you were looking at and
                        concerned about?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, it was something we were looking at. I think we had lesser
                    concern in a way. To a certain extent, if one has a notion of a limited power
                    pie, then German inroads into Eastern Europe were in competition with U.S. power
                    and control over what was happening in Eastern Europe. In fact in the economic
                    world that was very much often the case. It was either German investments and
                    ownership or American investments and ownership in some of the countries of
                    Eastern Europe. But I was really struck during my time on the Germany desk by
                    the vitality and the relevance of this notion of central European culture. It
                    was something that ironically the State Department organization kind of
                    reflected even in the depths of the Cold War when you had the Communist part of
                    Europe being dealt with in one bureau or one side of a very sharp bureaucratic
                    division except for East Germany, which was still part of Central European
                    Affairs and dealt with by all those people who were dealing with NATO affairs.
                    It was kind of an odd little artifact of that Central European notion. But John
                    Kornblum, who had such an important role in handling Germany in the State
                    Department from policy planning staff, from the European bureau, from Brussels
                    and eventually as ambassador in Germany, always spoke about Central European
                    identity as rooted in its historical knowledge. He always pointed out that this
                    Central European identify meant that Czechs and Slovaks and Hungarians and to a
                    certain extent even Poles saw a German cultural center there that extended from
                    the business community into the cultural realm in so many ways after the Cold
                    War ended and Europe was united. The Czechs and the Hungarians were enormously
                    influenced by the Germans, and the Germans had a lot of influence in these other
                    places they once had in German history. So a lot of that shift continued, and,
                    of course, it also extends to Russia and a historic German commitment to and
                    involvement in Russia that the U.S. really doesn't appreciate. I mean the
                    Germans always had a much longer-range view of Russia and I think Americans tend
                    to think of the German-Russian relationship as the terrible conflict between
                    Nazism and Communism, a very brutal German occupation, the holocaust. They
                    forget about the centuries old settlement of Germans under Catherine the Great,
                    the significant German industrial investments in Russia, and even the German or
                    Prussian soldiers that fought under the czars in the Napoleonic era. All of that
                    should not be exaggerated, but it's all there and helps account for a much
                    deeper German-Russian relationship than an American-Russian relationship. I
                    noticed even as recently as a couple of days ago in the Washington Post's Jim
                    Hoagland talking about Germany as just a spokesman for the West or the United
                    States in dealing with the Russians, which really doesn't capture the
                    relationship that I see as the Germans having a very distinct interest in
                    relations with Russia that doesn't correspond completely with the U.S. interests
                    and relations with the Russians. I mean it was manifested earlier in the Soviet
                    era when they had a gas pipeline into Germany, and the U.S. had a fit and said
                    this is unacceptable. The Germans had a different point of view about that.
                    There really is a different relationship. Even though there is clearly direct
                    economic competition in terms of Eastern European markets and other things, I
                    see this as being a friendly competition. I don't feel a sense of alarm about
                    German influence in Eastern Europe and Russia, because I think for the most part
                    their political values are our own values as well.</p>

                    <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there any concern at this time about I'd say the
                        diminution of American interests in Germany? It was no longer the frontline
                        state and things were happening all over. A considerable number of American
                        males myself included served in Germany as soldiers. All of a sudden this is
                        beginning to dissipate, and I was wondering whether Germany was so much
                        faded on our radar. Was this—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: That was very much a concern during my era on the Germany desk because
                    we were seeing the departure of half of the soldiers that were stationed in
                    Germany going to fight in the Gulf—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then left.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: And then they went home rather than going back to Germany. They just
                    went home so that the troop strength was cut in half, and, of course, now it's
                    even less, and with Rumsfeld talking about old Europe and looking lustily at
                    Eastern Europe you have a different situation. But our concern then was exactly
                    what you were talking about. You had more than one generation of Americans that
                    had intimate contact with the Germans. They had lived in their midst. They had
                    mixed with them. A whole lot of marriages resulted from that contact. There were
                    very big exchange programs with Germany, and then with the ending of the Cold
                    War there was a sense that it had become pass� and we had new frontiers to
                    explore. There was a real concern in the State Department about this loss of
                    initiative and priority and what were we going to do to replace that automatic
                    massive contact between our two cultures that resulted from our heavy military
                    investment in Germany. There were various things that were conceived and
                    programs implemented to try to move into a new era without losing the kind of
                    connectivity we had. But I think the concern was real and continues to this
                    day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I have a feeling that not as many people are taking
                        German, and if you're going on vacation, Germany is pretty far down the
                        list.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: That's right. That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There's France, Spain, Italy, Britain or a cruise in the
                        Baltics or something, but Germany is pretty far down the list. So the
                        contact is lessening in a way.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: That's right. I think it's less of a concern. There's still plenty of
                    German contact with the United States partly because of the relationship between
                    the Euro and the dollar. I mean the U.S. is still a very popular tourist
                    destination. I mean there are enormous number of Germans in Florida and so
                    forth. Germans are still or even more capable in English than they ever were. So
                    that's not so much a problem. But it's the Americans being exposed to Germany
                    and learning German and traveling in Germany. That's the tough one. We were
                    working hard during that period on it and I think are still working on it now. I
                    should also mention that that was the period when Richard Holbrooke was first
                    ambassador to Germany, and then he came back to become head of the European
                    bureau. So I saw Holbrooke from both perspectives as sort of our man in Germany
                    and then back as boss.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Holbrooke in this
                        particular—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Holbrooke was very capable and impressive in terms of his energy
                    level, his ability to work the system and this a bit of a reluctant witness
                    because I thought he had some serious character flaws. But I found myself so
                    frequently in agreement with his policy instincts and his sense of where U.S.
                    interests lay. So that's my reluctant witness, but he was such an egomaniac. He
                    had such non-admirable character traits from my perspective that it was hard for
                    me to see him as a model senior diplomat nor someone that I would be happy to
                    see as Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were there, what was the situation in former

                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I think I missed the really critical period when Germany from
                    retrospect jumped the gun and recognized the various component parts of
                    Yugoslavia and at least from what I've heard from those who know the area much
                    better than I kind of precipitated some of the crises.</p>

                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, so I think that Germany had played a role there that it should
                    not be particularly proud of. But in some respects it tried to make up for it
                    later by committing significant forces to the very unpleasant and thankless task
                    of creating order and some foundation for the birth of democracy and the rule of
                    law there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were there any particular events or something that

                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: There were a lot of little anecdotes. I'll just mention a couple. One
                    is in terms of interesting State Department dynamics. There was a secretary in
                    the office that was not performing adequately, and I remember, when I first came
                    in the office, an attempt to remove her from a position had been underway for
                    almost two years. During the time I was in the office, she was finally separated
                    for reasons of non-performance. But I looked back on it as being an
                    extraordinary effort by a series of foreign service officers basically to do
                    their job, take seriously their supervisory responsibilities and document
                    someone who was not performing adequately. It was obviously something that
                    caused the office significantly because none of the offices had the secretarial
                    support that we would've liked to have had. So when you had one that was not
                    functioning up to standards, it was a heavy burden. But in this case after I
                    think three years the office was eventually successful. I remember that
                    personnel rewarded this kind of bureaucratic heroism on the part of the
                    sustained efforts of a number of officers by basically taking away the position,
                    by saying, “well, you obviously don't need this person because you've been
                    getting along without him.” I thought it was sort of a tremendous and of course
                    terribly damning example of the State Department internal management and the
                    personnel system doing exactly the wrong thing. So that was one little
                    piece.</p>
                <p>Another thing that I remember well was an effort to try to talk the Coast Guard
                    into a port visit in Northern Germany by the Coast Guard training ship Eagle.
                    This is a tall ship, big sails.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tall ship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I was just remembering with amusement about trying to talk the Coast
                    Guard into doing this when, there was some sort of inconvenience for their
                    schedule even though they were going to be in European waters. It seemed like it
                    was a real chance of them doing this, but I couldn't quite make it happen. The
                    irony of this really struck me too since the Eagle was previously a German ship,
                    which was seized as war booty. It was the Horst-Wessel, which was a Nazi
                    song.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nazi martyr.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, Nazi martyr. I thought it was very funny that not only did we
                    steal their ship but we wouldn't visit. I mean the Germans really wanted it as
                    part of Bremer-hoffen or some local event. So that was just an amusing little
                    occurrence. But I guess that's all I'm coming up with at the moment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well this is probably a good place to stop. In '95
                        where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: After the Germany desk I was planning on going to Germany. But alas in
                    the strange ways of personnel, of two jobs that I had my eye on, one was
                    eliminated. The sure fall back went to the special assistant to the head of the
                    European Bureau, and I ended up going back to Brazil as a political officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was from your first tour.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: It was my first tour, and it ended up being my last foreign tour. So
                    back in the same political section in the same embassy—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there from '95 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: To '98.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well, we'll pick this up the next time at that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is the 22nd of March, 2005. Greg, all right, we're off to Brazil. You were,
                    I assume in Bras�lia. You were in the political section. What were you doing
                    there?</p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I was one of the more senior line political officers there. It was a
                    little demoralizing to me when I first got in the embassy because I literally
                    was sitting in an office just two down from where I was at the beginning of my
                    foreign service career in 1977. It seemed a little bit as if I was moving up the
                    political ladder like one rung after seventeen years. That kind of overstates
                    the degree of change. But all of us in the political section actually divided
                    domestic responsibilities and foreign affairs responsibilities. So, for example,
                    because of my background, I dealt with all of the political military issues
                    involving Brazil. I was the one who interfaced with the defense attach�s. I had
                    some of the Brazilian political parties—and there were quite a few—in terms of
                    keeping track of them and some aspects of national policies. So that's really
                    how I started my three-year tour. I might just mention an interesting tidbit on
                    the language front: I came back into a Portuguese refresher course shortly
                    before leaving for Bras�lia again. There had been a seventeen-year interval
                    since I had last served in Brazil, and there was very little opportunity to
                    maintain my Portuguese during that time. In the intervening time I had served in
                    German-speaking and Russian-speaking posts. So it was a very interesting
                    experience of trying to extract from the far corners of my mind those Portuguese
                    words, and I remember one little problem I was having. I kept inserting like one
                    Russian word in my Portuguese sentences, and the frustrated Portuguese teacher
                    after a while asked me who this person was that I kept mentioning, but it was
                    just a Russian word that was sort of mixed into a Portuguese construct. So I
                    found that obviously learning Portuguese the second time was much faster than
                    the first, and it was. My language was pretty serviceable when I arrived at
                    post.</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, first who was the ambassador when you arrived there?
                        What was the state of Brazil at the time and then Brazilian-American
                        relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: The ambassador was Melvin Levitsky, and one of the interesting things
                    about the relationship with Brazil was that during my first tour it was, one
                    could say almost at the nadir. It was during the Jimmy Carter years. Human
                    rights and nuclear proliferation seemed to be the main components of our
                    Brazilian policy at the time. Of course the military dictatorship at the time
                    resented deeply both of those policy initiatives. Much had happened in the
                    intervening time. One of the things that happened was that Fernando Henrique
                    Cardoso was elected president in Brazil, and his rule followed some extremely
                    mediocre Brazilian presidents that were either corrupt or incompetent or both.
                    So there was unfortunate squandering of an opportunity during some of those
                    intervening years when Brazil did have a new constitution which needed some
                    tweaking and reforming. But there was only a ten-year window for doing that, and
                    ironically just as the president came onboard who knew how the constitution
                    needed to be changed and where the reforms needed to be, that ten years elapsed.
                    So he had to do it in the hard way with I forget what kind of a majority it was,
                    but it was no longer 51 percent. It was either three-fifths or two-thirds
                    needed, which is extremely difficult to get in the Brazilian congress. Anyway in
                    terms of Brazilian-U.S. relations the circumstances were really very favorable
                    for a significant improvement in the relationship because the president of
                    Brazil had values that were very similar to our own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the president?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Cardoso. One had also during my tour Bill Clinton as president, and
                    Clinton and Cardoso were very much on the same wavelength. I mean whether one
                    wants to call it sort of the new Democrats or kind of democratic reformers or
                    whatever. The same kind of triangle that made Blair a very effective European
                    interlocutor with Clinton. So on a number of issues like nuclear
                    nonproliferation where Brazilians had, one might say, a Gaullist approach of
                    feeling the injustice of a regime that put nuclear powers into one category and
                    all non-nuclear powers in another category. So they persistently and stubbornly
                    refused to be a member of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty during all that
                    time. During my tour they finally agreed to coming on board. They basically made
                    the intellectual decision to abandon those elements that were interested in
                    nuclear weapons and long range missiles. When they made a very effective
                    agreement with Argentina basically to open up each other's nuclear facilities to
                    mutual inspections so that they would eliminate any suspicions that either was
                    seeking nuclear weapons and long range missiles. This agreement with Argentina
                    in effect placed all the restrictions that the NPT would, but they refused to
                    sign the NPT because it was a deep-seated emotional and historical position for
                    them. But the NPT was one of a number of areas in which the long-standing
                    differences between U.S. and Brazil started to close. I really see in a lot of
                    ways the period as being kind of a golden era between the U.S. and Brazil in
                    terms of bilateral relationships.</p>
                <p>So just as my first tour there was a close hand glimpse of all the problems
                    resulting from a deteriorating bilateral relationship, this time I could see the
                    potential of favorable circumstances allowing for a lot of productive work by
                    diplomatic entities. This included with us over that period a number of VIP
                    visits, which would result in deliverables. I mean, Clinton made his first visit
                    to Brazil while I was in the embassy, and his wife made a separate visit. The
                    Secretary of State made a visit independently and then with the President and
                    former presidents. George H. W. Bush visited Brazil when I was there. Jimmy
                    Carter visited Brazil when I was there. A lot of other Americans came to the
                    country while I was there.</p>
                <p>So anyway, back to my job. I was in this very interesting job. For the first time
                    in my career it was a job that did not seem to require me to come in every
                    weekend like most of my other foreign jobs. It was not a crisis situation. But
                    it was an opportunity for a lot of very good and interesting work. It was also a
                    very pleasant family situation because my wife as a former Peace Corp volunteer
                    returned to a country where she was quite fluent in the language, actually more
                    fluent in terms of colloquial Portuguese than I was. She had middle class
                    Brazilian friends in Juiz de Fora and some other Brazilian cities. This provided
                    a useful opportunity too because the American embassy people would really have
                    contact only with the elite, the power elite of Brasilia who were very rich and
                    very privileged people or the lower classes who would shine our shoes or pick up
                    the garbage and everything. There wasn't a whole lot from a Brasilia living
                    perspective in between. I valued a lot having some contacts over the course of
                    three years with my wife's previous Peace Corp contacts, who were schoolteachers
                    and other people who would fit solidly in that middle class role.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had the political military portfolio.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Brazilian military. Had
                        they really gone back to the barracks? Where were they recruited from? I
                        mean looking at it as a foreign analyst, how would you characterize the
                        Brazilian military at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Thinking back on it, I would say that the Brazilian military was
                    pretty solidly back in the barracks in their own state of mind. There were a lot
                    of bad memories associated with their period of rule even for themselves and the
                    way they looked at things. The military there sees themselves as sort of the
                    national savior, as different than the corrupt politicians and so forth. But
                    they I think felt very burned by that period too because they looked back on it
                    as a period that corrupted the Brazilian military instead of the military
                    cleansing the country. They were sensitive to the human rights abuses, although
                    not quite sensitive the way we would've liked them to be sensitive. I think they
                    did not really purge people who had sordid records or whatever. But I think it's
                    fair to say that most of the leadership of the Brazilian military was not like
                    the stereotypical Latin American military that was interested more in
                    suppressing unpopular movements rather than in some sort of national mission.
                    They had a lot of kind of uniquely Brazilian notions about their calling to
                    defend the Amazon. Now the threat to the Amazon they wanted to defend was kind
                    of an imaginary U.S. threat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yeah, I mean how we were going to take it over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Right, it was kind of hard to keep a straight face sometimes listening
                    to some elements of the Brazilian military talking about U.S. designs on the
                    Amazon. The Brazilians were very suspicious of even the most innocent things,
                    the cooperative programs to work on malaria and all those tropical illnesses
                    where U.S. military could really make some valuable contributions really to
                    world health. During my period there there was a long running conflict over the
                    Brazilian attempt to establish a surveillance system that would allow them to
                    police air traffic over the Amazon in a more effective way called SIVAM
                    (EnglisSystem to Guard the Amazon). There was some corruption in that program
                    too and there were a lot of suspicions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the drug smugglers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, that was—</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On behalf of Bolivia and—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Right, that was certainly part of the motivation. From a Brazilian
                    perspective it was very much an attempt to maintain or even in some cases
                    establish sovereignty over extremely sparsely settled region with indigenous
                    peoples and others that one might say had questionable loyalty to the Brazilian
                    government. During that period also there were insurgencies in Columbia and
                    Venezuela that caused some border problems with Brazil — not arguments over
                    where the border was because Brazil was quite proud of the fact that many years
                    ago they had established borders with which all of their neighbors agreed. But
                    it was more a kind of the spillover of insurgencies where the people would
                    either want to use Brazilian territories as a refuge or would want to exploit
                    one part of Brazil. Protection in the Amazon was really after the Brazilians
                    threw off a lot of their silliness about the conventional war with Argentina
                    which was sort of their “raison d'�tre” (reason for being) for many years. The
                    Amazon really emerged as let's say, the core defense mission of Brazil that
                    enlivened and gave esprit to a lot of the Brazilian military efforts.</p>
                <p>Now Brazil's military also still had a counter insurgency role in effect or a
                    role to establish order when police authorities couldn't handle things — a
                    bigger role than the U.S. or Western European militaries had. But the Brazilian
                    military was not keen on doing that kind of thing. It wasn't the same kind of
                    military that some of the other Latin American countries would have. But it was
                    a very proud military too.</p>
                <p>Just a final thought about it is they were suspicious of the United States. Their
                    egos were constantly bruised by having the U.S. prefer the Commander in Chief of
                    the Central Command being their interface instead of the Pentagon. The word
                    theater commander was very offensive to them. They didn't see themselves as a
                    theater. So there was a constant struggle. They wanted to do business with
                    Washington, and Washington wanted to go through the CINCENCOM to deal with the
                    Brazilians. The Brazilians harbor a lot of grudges personal and otherwise. A
                    Brazilian general told me about going to the post office in the United States
                    and someone wanting to sell him postage for Belize instead of Brazil. Obviously
                    all these years later it was still bothering him that that happened. A Brazilian
                    admiral told me on the occasion of a ship visit about the U.S. military's plans
                    to invade Brazil at the beginning of World War One, which I thought was another
                    sort of silly Brazilian excursion. Then a couple of months later I read in the
                    Proceedings of the U.S. Naval Institute, a magazine to which I subscribe, an
                    article laying out the U.S. plans for an entire Marine divisions to seize the
                    northeastern part of Brazil in order to have a launching pad for the invasion of
                    Africa. Apparently this was a real plan, and it was part of the leverage in the
                    negotiations with the Brazilian government, which ultimately resulted in a
                    Brazilian invitation for the U.S. to establish our largest air base in the world
                    during World War Two, in Natal, Brazil. So the Brazilian admiral had it right. I
                    naively thought the U.S. would never do that kind of thing even though of course
                    we had invaded Iceland to take over airbases there. Anyway, that was the
                    complexion of the Brazilian military when I was there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Oh I'm sorry, one more thing. The composition of the military was
                    increasingly middle class and lower middle class, a very different composition
                    than the Brazilian foreign service for example, which continued to be a very
                    much elite organization. The Brazilian military was getting to be the kind of
                    place where people of color, that is to say darker-skinned Brazilians, could
                    actually serve as officers, unlike the pattern fifteen to twenty years earlier
                    when as some commentators noted that if you saw the Brazilian army marching by,
                    you could almost tell the rank by the shade of the skin. It was becoming the
                    kind of institution the U.S. military has really become — where merit was more
                    important than socioeconomic background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the military tackling the way our military has women
                        in the ranks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I think not the way the U.S. has. I can't remember right now what the
                    legal rules were for women. But I rarely saw women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Brazilian politicians? Were they a different
                        breed than you'd found before? I mean, overall was Bras�lia really the
                        capital by this point I mean in thought, in word or in deed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Bras�lia really was the capital, and that was a dramatic change
                    between the late '70s when I was there and the mid to late 1990s. Bras�lia for a
                    number of years was a very artificial construct, and the government had a rough
                    time keeping the legislators in Brazil when all of them really longed to be back
                    in Rio. I could never really get over the fact of their departure. When I
                    returned to Bras�lia you had a whole generation of condongos or Bras�lia-born
                    natives who saw everything about Bras�lia as being their norm and didn't pine
                    for the beaches as previous generations had. Even the appearance of the city was
                    dramatically altered. When I was there, there were still a lot of bare red earth
                    and termite mounds between the apartment buildings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember seeing a movie called Our Man from Rio or
                        something. It was a French movie. It showed all this red dirt piled up and
                        these modernistic cement buildings.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: There were still a lot of city neighborhoods that were still to be
                    constructed. I mean there were kind of vacant lots still when I was first there.
                    When I returned most of the original plan — and it's a planned city — basically
                    looking from 10,000 feet or a mosquito or a bird depending on how you wanted to
                    look at it, but all of the pieces of that bird's body had been filled in the
                    second time I was there. So even some of the shantytowns of the city of Bras�lia
                    had become more established and looked more like regular Brazilian towns. Some
                    of the ways in which the urban planners had unrealistic decided this is the side
                    of the building where the people are going to enter and this is the path that
                    the people will take walking to this building. Of course life had intervened,
                    and some of the footpaths had been turned into concrete and everything. It was a
                    more livable, less raw kind of place when I was there — a lot of tropical
                    flowers and vegetation. It was really a very attractive city in many ways with a
                    San Diego-like climate, high and dry as a characteristic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as a political military officer did you work with
                        our military to explain the sensitivity of the Brazilian military. I would
                        think that you and the attach�s had quite a job preparing visitors from
                        Washington — particularly military visitors but others about the sensitivity
                        over fleet visits, and everything else for them to understand that they're
                        not just coming to another friendly country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, we constantly had to do some missionary work with visitors, and
                    we had very savvy attach�s for the most part. Certainly the Defense Attach� was
                    extremely good, and his written briefings for either the Secretary of Defense or
                    visiting generals were always very good scene setters for them. So fortunately
                    we were pretty much on the same wavelength on the kind of things we would
                    prepare civilians for. But it was very difficult to get U.S. military officers
                    that were accustomed to going around Central America ready for Brazil and to get
                    out of their heads that, no, you're not going to just tell the Brazilians what
                    kind of status of forces arrangements you want to have or arrangements for this
                    or that. It was also similarly hard to acclimatize some of the civilians who
                    would come to Brazil because Brazil is really kind of a great undiscovered
                    country in the U.S. political mind. Brazil would occasionally have a crisis or
                    something that would enter the minds of members of the National Security
                    Council, and then there would be fifteen years during which they would never
                    think about Brazil at all. The fact that half of all Latin Americans live in
                    Brazil does not correspond to the attention that Brazil gets in terms of
                    visitors and the time of U.S. national security managers and key decision
                    makers. So a lot of what we would do would be continuing effort to inform and
                    update Americans who were involved in foreign and defense policies on what the
                    realities were. The business community of course always understood Brazil's
                    importance because there were enormous investments there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during the Clinton visit. How did that go
                        from your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: It went very well. We had several so-called deliverables, initiatives,
                    things that were launched in preparation for the visit and then announced during
                    the visit. So we regarded it as extremely successful, successful at altering
                    somewhat the Brazilian image of the U.S. as sort of a heavy-handed imperialist.
                    Clinton because of his personal qualities loved the visit. I mean, Clinton, the
                    musician, reacted very well to the African-Brazilian musicians that he
                    encountered, and Clinton is such a natural in these kinds of visits. He could
                    connect with people of all levels. He had a great intellectual meeting of minds
                    with Cardoso, and yet he could just as effectively interact with street
                    musicians. So it was a great visit.</p>
                <p>There is one little personal embarrassment for me in that I believe that I was
                    the one who drafted what I believe was originally a limited official use summary
                    of the Brazilian political context and which was then used in a briefing package
                    for American journalists. I'm not even sure if it started out being written as
                    confidential or whether it was limited official use. But anyway, it ended up in
                    the hands of the press, and they picked out one statement that I believe I had
                    penned about corruption being endemic in Brazil. This got out to the Brazilian
                    press, and, of course, they were extremely indignant that the U.S. would
                    characterize Brazil in this way. It ended up blossoming just as the President
                    was arriving. He ended up apologizing to the Brazilians for this
                    characterization. I always thought it was an unusual and dubious honor to write
                    words that the President of the United States then had to apologize for. Of
                    course, on an intellectual and analytical basis, I stand by what was said, and
                    it was not written for public consumption. Obviously I would've been more
                    diplomatic in the way that I stated it, but this was a very consistent theme of
                    our political analysis. If one looked at the Brazilian political picture, all
                    politics is corrupt in a sense, but especially the Brazilian Congress is very
                    much a function of — or let's say ordered by — money and influence, and the
                    Brazilian political and business culture was really infused by that as well. So
                    when organizations like Transparency International would rate countries around
                    the world in terms of corruption, Brazil would usually rank pretty high. The
                    Brazilians themselves in analyzing this problem would share a lot of the
                    sentiments in their own analysis. But it was just unfortunately presented.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find being in Bras�lia a difficult place to sort
                        of cover the country because of S�o Paolo and Rio or other places. Was it
                        difficult to work out of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: I would say no, but one of the problems we had, of course, was as in
                    most places the travel budget was somewhat limited. We had the usual sense that
                    we were penned down in the embassy by the responsibilities of the time, and
                    travel opportunities even when the money existed were more limited than we would
                    want. The country's enormous. The land area is the same as that of the
                    continental United States. We did have fairly good plane connections from
                    Bras�lia, but it was a challenge as it is any time you have a number of
                    constituent posts and a particular challenge in the economic sector since the
                    vital beating heart of Brazilian economy is in S�o Paolo, not in Bras�lia. So it
                    was a challenge, but it was one that I thought that we handled fairly well, and
                    this is probably a good segue into what happened after I had been there one
                    year. Our political counselor retired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: That was Ted Wilkinson. The deputy political counselor, my boss, moved
                    into the political counselor position, and I became the deputy political
                    counselor. So whatever reservations I had about that very modest move up in the
                    seventeen years seemed a lot different after one year in Bras�lia when, as
                    political counselor, I had more of an involvement in the management and the
                    orchestration of political reporting throughout the country. I tried to be very
                    conscious about orchestrating how we would report on national events, nationwide
                    elections and everything with close coordination from the political officers in
                    our constituent posts or in some cases with the principal officer who was the
                    only officer. That was challenging and enjoyable because I realized that I liked
                    that kind of coordinating, managerial function of sort of orchestrating how a
                    number of posts do a coordinated and coherent job describing what's going on in
                    the country to the Washington audience. There were also opportunities for me to
                    travel to the various posts, meet with some of the people doing the reporting
                    and make some of my own personal contacts. One of the most memorable of my trips
                    was a trip to Marab� which was a city in the Amazon that had a real Wild West
                    flavor to it. It was one of those cities where there was only marginal control
                    by civil and police authorities. There were huge disputes over the ownership of
                    land. There was an influx of poor Brazilians who had been granted little pieces
                    of land along some of the highways by the Brazilian government as part of a land
                    reform program. There was in the general region great mineral wealth, huge iron
                    ore deposits, and it seemed like a real natural for me to plan a trip there with
                    one of the political officers that was reporting to me as deputy political
                    counselor. He was the one who was drafting the human rights report in fact and,
                    since this was an area where so many of the abuses originated, we thought it was
                    a natural for a trip that actually had us both going into the region through
                    different angles. I went through the state of Maranh�o in northeastern Brazil,
                    and then I took a Brazilian passenger train that was run by a big iron producing
                    company all the way into Marab� sort of an all day trip. He approached from a
                    different direction, and then we were planning to spend several days together,
                    but the ambassador originally thought this was too extravagant to have two
                    officers going to the same place. We had to make a pitch to him with a
                    justification to override his own reservations. It turned out that about a week
                    before we were scheduled to arrive, there was a massacre of peasants at a rural
                    road junction that became one of the most significant human rights development
                    in the entire year. So the timing of our trip, while fortuitous, was really the
                    perfect thing for the embassy to report on this development including both of us
                    inserting ourselves into the interrogation of some of the people involved and
                    having that kind of first hand account. We got some coverage at the time also as
                    being the first diplomats going into the area to investigate this and
                    manifesting the U.S. government's concern about the allegations of what had
                    happened. While part of it was accidental in terms of timing, I thought this was
                    really a great use of embassy resources to combine human rights reporting,
                    political reporting, on the scene with some of the let's say more academic or
                    distanced commentary from an embassy perspective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how about the local officials? I'd think they'd be
                        kind of unhappy to have you mucking around there.</hi>

                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: There was a combination of reactions. Certainly some were not happy to
                    see us. There were a lot of non-government organizations operating in the area
                    that were very happy to see us, delighted to see some manifestation of concern
                    for some of the things that they had been complaining about for a long time. But
                    even some of the politicians were people who were trying to do their best in
                    difficult circumstances, and they were not happy at all with the massacre that
                    took place, and it was not as uniformly hostile as one would suspect in that
                    kind of situation. So that was one of the highlights of my tour there. Another
                    thing related to the human rights front should be said. The human rights report
                    was still resented by the Brazilian government as probably it is in almost all
                    countries. But we had a kind of unique glimpse there. Since I had this vivid
                    memory of how much the U.S. inserting itself into human rights during the time
                    of the dictatorship was resented. There was a fascinating meeting that we hosted
                    in the embassy between the visiting former president Jimmy Carter to Brasilia
                    and a group of Brazilian human rights organizations including representatives of
                    the Brazilian government's human rights commission. The incredible thing about
                    this session was people roughly my age in their fifties or in their forties
                    telling Jimmy Carter about the importance of the U.S. position on human rights
                    events at the time in the late '70s when there was a lot of open oppression.
                    Some of these people who had been in prison at the time, others in exile, others
                    who were now serving in government were part of the opposition movement and the
                    pro-human rights movement at that time. So there was almost unanimity around the
                    table about what a vital service the U.S. had performed in the human rights
                    profile at the time. It was a good reminder that the way it seems at the time is
                    not always the enduring legacy of a particular policy.</p>

                        '70s during the Carter thing, and we had North Korea thirty miles to the
                        north, and so many divisions poised to come in. We were very unhappy with
                        this. Why are we monkeying around with human rights? We've got a real
                        problem here but in the long run, I mean it took time but it has become part
                        of the vocabulary, world vocabulary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, the human rights report is something that a lot of people turn
                    to. Amnesty International does one too, but the U.S. government does have
                    certain sources that others don't have, and so it's become a much quoted
                    reference document.</p>

                <p>THIELMANN: I would say we were quite successful, successful also in getting it

                <p>THIELMANN: And also in not arousing more than the usual kind of grumbling about
                    hypocrisy, and I'm quite proud of it. I mean the glory goes to the drafter
                    really. But I feel very good about it not being vulnerable to attack. We, no one
                    really, found us deficient in our statement of facts.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were students going at this time? Were they going to
                        Europe or were they going to the United States? Where was the flow of young
                        people going?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: At my time students were still going to the United States
                    overwhelmingly, and this was very significant because in another generation
                    there was a whole series of Brazilian intellectuals who were educated in Europe,
                    and Cardoso was a good example of that. I mean, he was very French-oriented in
                    terms of his education. Even though he later spent time in the United States
                    while he was in exile from earlier Brazilian military governments. But there's a
                    strong sort of European continental Brazilian intellectual thrust, which of
                    course originates in the fact that the colonizer was Portugal, but it kind of
                    extends into a broader European intellectual thrust.</p>

                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, I think that's right. Culturally and temperamentally Brazilians
                    were quite happy throughout the Latin-speaking world, and Italy would be another
                    place, but in terms of the intellectual centers I think more Paris and
                    secondarily Portugal in terms of the traditional education of the Brazilian
                    elite. But the U.S. was still a very powerful magnet when I was there, and since
                    I left of course, I have wondered about how our visa restrictions have changed
                    that now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's a concern. Did you find when dealing with Brazilian
                        politicians and the military that they understood the United States? This
                        was always a problem. America's a complex country, and our politics are
                        difficult for an American to understand and yet they drive what we do, and
                        it's nice to have a political body that understands at least where you are
                        coming from. Did you find this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: I found what I usually find in other countries — that the
                    understanding of the United States and all of its complexities even among
                    educated natives is not very astute. In the case of Brazil, though, there was so
                    much more Brazilian understanding of the U.S. than there was American
                    understanding of Brazil. Put in that comparative context, I would say the
                    Brazilians seemed to actually understand the United States fairly well. In terms
                    of the Brazilian elite, not only had they been to the United States, but their
                    kids were sort of raised in Disneyworld or so it seemed. They, the Brazilians,
                    visiting the United States absolutely loved New York City. California, or let's
                    say the more cosmopolitan coastal U.S. was something the influential Brazilians,
                    had a lot of personal contact with. They still had kind of a Hollywood version
                    of the United States in many ways. As my wife told me when she first went to
                    Brazil, in the smaller villages and even some of the larger cities in the rural
                    areas, they were shocked to see that she didn't have blonde hair. I mean, there
                    was that kind of very simplistic image of the United States. Even in the more
                    sophisticated circles that I would run in, there was often surprise when the
                    Americans did something that didn't fit the stereotype of a kind of heavy-handed
                    imperialistic approach to issues. So it's hard to say the Brazilians really
                    understood the U.S. and all of its nuances, but, in comparison with some of the
                    other countries that I've served in, they had a pretty good knowledge of their
                    big brother to the north.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How Latin American was Brazil? I mean how much did they
                        look to their other neighbors or were they really a different world and
                        these just happened to be appendages onto their geographic position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I think Brazil is a place unto itself in many ways, but it is also
                    increasingly a Latin American country. There was always a lot of similarities,
                    of course, but in terms of Brazilian consciousness, they were bigger and better
                    than their neighbors. So they would almost be offended to see themselves as just
                    one of several South American countries. Yet politically speaking the Brazilians
                    realized that their own weight is not always sufficient enough to get our
                    attention or to lobby effectively for political change or economic change. So
                    before I arrived in Brazil the founding of Mercosur [Spanish: Mercado Com�n del
                    Sur; English: Southern Common Market] or as the Brazilians would say Mercosul
                    [”Mercado Comum do Sul”]—</p>

                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: The Spanish would say Mercosur.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The common market of—</hi>

                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: The common market of Brazil, Uruguay, Argentina, Chile and I guess
                    Paraguay [Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay, Paraguay]. I've forgotten now. This was
                    something the Brazilians were very serious about. They wanted economic
                    integration to occur there before NAFTA or before a hemispheric integration
                    occurred, and they were trying to woe the Chileans in that direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were they looking at, you know, the Chilean model
                        which seems to be the most successful one in that whole area. Were you
                        hearing things of envy about Chile or inquiries? Obviously the size
                        difference is tremendous.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I think intellectually there was interest in that. But the Brazilians
                    were so proud of being Brazilians that it's very hard for them to envy any of
                    their neighbors. There's this long rivalry with the Argentineans, and the
                    Argentineans were kind of proud, sort of European-South Americans, and would
                    have a little bit of that kind of racist looking down at the Brazilians as being
                    this horrible mix of races and disorderly people. The Brazilians, so many of
                    them, saw virtue in their mixed blood and in their dynamism and had their own
                    reasons for not seeing the Argentineans as a model for them, but I think that it
                    almost goes the same way with Chile too. I mean Chile and Argentina are both
                    kind of heavily European racial kind of places in a more temperate climate zone,
                    and Brazil didn't necessarily see models in these countries as being directly
                    applicable to them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Mexico play very much of a role or is too far
                        away?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I'd say it was just too far away. The real economic powerhouses are
                    Mexico and Brazil now. I mean in a lot of ways they're in kind of the same
                    category. Also in their suspicious and defensive attitude about the United
                    States, they're in the same category. So Brazil and Mexico would often have
                    common cause in political attitudes and positions, but it was really too far
                    away. Brazilians to the extent that they see themselves integrated in a region
                    of the world are South Americans and have much less sort of kinship with Central
                    Americans or Mexicans. However there is also a consciousness about being part of
                    the hemisphere, and one can see right now in the large Brazilian contingent in
                    Haiti that Brazil does take it's OAS [Organization of American States] role and
                    the hemispheric role seriously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about other embassies there? Often the American
                        embassy is the embassy the other embassies come to to get information and
                        all that. Were there other embassies, i.e., those of countries playing a
                        role like European Union or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: I think that's true on economic issues. I mean there were European
                    Union representatives. I wasn't as close on economic issues. So I would say from
                    my political perspective we had good and friendly relations with a number of
                    other embassies there, and the ambassador certainly met with some of his
                    colleagues. But I wouldn't say that we relied too heavily on them. The Canadian
                    embassy or some of the Scandinavian embassies or the European embassies that
                    tried to keep track of political developments would certainly be worth talking
                    to in terms of getting their perspective or maybe hearing from some of the
                    people that they had spoken with. But in general we had so many more people to
                    cover the issues, and there was such a difference in scale that we could do a
                    lot of things that the other embassies really couldn't do. It wasn't the kind of
                    relationship you would have had with the embassies that were of roughly of equal
                    size.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Given the seventeen-year difference, you arrived there in
                        '95 and all, the communication revolution really had hit by that time — the
                        ability to email, telephone easily and all that — how does that affect your
                        operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: The question of communications was a very dramatic difference between
                    my two tours. I remember well a little ways into my first tour we started
                    getting a summary of the Walter Cronkite evening news program. I remember that
                    that was kind of our connection with developments in the United States or it was
                    a much better way to find out about what was happening. I think the whole week
                    was condensed into an hour, and we would play it over lunch at the cafeteria.
                    Telephone service was not very good when I was there before, and it was very
                    expensive to call the United States. So we were really connected only by letters
                    with home. When I returned, of course, cable news was big. We had a choice of a
                    lot of Brazilian television stations, many of which were quite sophisticated and
                    produced soap operas for export to all kinds of other countries. The Brazilians
                    themselves were extraordinarily well plugged in. I'm obviously talking now about
                    the elite, but even middle class Brazilians had discovered the cell phone, and I
                    think the Brazilians took to cell phones like almost no other culture has. One
                    would see them everywhere, and the Brazilians would like to talk and keep in
                    touch with people by phone. I think cell phone use increased exponentially. So
                    the country was much more in touch with itself and the outside world when I was
                    there than previously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about dealing with Washington? I mean, it would
                        appear that fast communications and all this would mean that Washington
                        didn't really need to have an embassy because it could all be done by fax or
                        telephone or what have you. But I've heard on the ground that actually it
                        means the embassy sometimes has a greater role in presenting things and all
                        because it can get into the planning stage of presenting a demarche or what
                        have you rather than getting it and not being able to have that input. Did
                        that affected you at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Brazil was still far enough away and enough off the beaten track that
                    I felt our embassy there and the constituent post still played a pretty central
                    role. I mean as I said before I thought that Brazil only sporadically entered
                    the consciousness of high ranking Americans, and so that really left to the
                    ambassador more of the business than would be the case in some other countries.
                    So I felt that we had a little bit more leash on some of the initiatives than we
                    might have had in other places. Most embassy officers felt that we knew better
                    than Washington about how these things should be handled in the field.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you left there in '98.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: In '98 I went back to the Intelligence Bureau, the same office in the
                    intelligence bureau that I had worked in earlier in the decade, 1990-1993. The
                    office name had changed shortly before I left the first time to the Office of
                    Analysis for Strategic Proliferation and Military Affairs. But the office, let
                    me back up here. The office when I first came to it was called Strategic Forces
                    Analysis. It had incorporated proliferation increasingly as time passed, and it
                    became less just an office that would analyze what the status of Soviet
                    strategic forces was. The important thing that changed in terms of the
                    responsibilities of the office since I was there before is that another office
                    in State Department Intelligence Bureau, INR, had merged with the office I was
                    going into. Basically it was the part of INR's activities that monitored
                    political-military developments. Conventional military forces that used to have
                    their own separate office became part of SPM (Strategic Proliferation and
                    Military Affairs). The strategic analysis part of it and the proliferation
                    analysis part of it were basically exactly the same as when I left. I even went
                    into the same division, the strategic and arms control division that I had left
                    previously. Before I had been acting division chief. I returned as division
                    chief because I had been promoted to FS01 and that allowed me to take the
                    division chief job. This was a very comfortable return because I knew the
                    issues. I knew the people that I was working with. My supervisor, the office
                    director Alan Locke, had been my supervisor upon leaving. It was really great to
                    be back in such a comfortable setting, but intellectually stimulating because
                    obviously a lot of things had changed in the intervening five years.</p>

                <p>THIELMANN: I did it from 1998 to 2002. The experience there really can be
                    bifurcated by me becoming the office director. So I was really division chief
                    for two years, and then I was office director for two years. The circumstances
                    of me becoming office director probably are worth mentioning because it involved
                    the notorious disappearance of a laptop. That was from this office.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's do up to '98 to 2000 and then we come to the—. How
                        was the strategic situation, what were we seeing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Well, by this time we were still monitoring the START II treaty and
                    its painful way through the Russian Duma, where a lot of Russian nationalists
                    were raising objections to what they saw as the unfairness of a treaty that they
                    felt really had been dictated by the United States as winner of the Cold War and
                    as the country that held all the cards in the late '80s and early 1990s. From an
                    analytical perspective I think we felt that in some sense the U.S. was reaping
                    what we had sewn. We were so eager to get the best possible treaty for
                    ourselves, which is to say one that allowed for a strategic force structure that
                    was really the one we wanted one that depended on sea-based systems,
                    discriminated against large multiple warhead land-based systems and at levels
                    that the U.S. wanted, that is higher levels than what the Russians would have
                    probably agreed to. That really violates one of the major principles of
                    negotiations — that you want to negotiate agreements which both sides see as in
                    their own interests. Now the truth is that at this point because the Russian
                    economy and the Russian political order were in such sad shape and because they
                    really had no alternative recourse this treaty was still a deal for the
                    Russians. They couldn't really exploit the kind of opportunities that they would
                    have had and a treaty that they would've written because they just didn't have
                    the resources anymore. But that doesn't really answer the emotions that the
                    Russians had. Because the United States was so insistent on pursuing its
                    strategic defense initiative or missile defense program, we basically lost what
                    eventually became the opportunity to get START II. I mean, ultimately the
                    Russians agreed to it, did the rational thing. But they conditioned it on the
                    U.S. not going forward with missile defenses because obviously strategic missile
                    defenses can recalibrate all of the strategic calculations and the Russians had
                    agreed to START II on the assumption that the anti-ballistic missile treaty
                    would remain in force. So that was the overall background. During this period
                    the Russians very slowly and reluctantly agreeing to the strategic arms
                    agreement that had been negotiated previously, agreeing to ratify it on the
                    condition that we would stick with the ABM treaty, which then the administration
                    decided not to do so. But during 1998 to 2000 we were still in the process of
                    trying to get the Russians to ratify START II. We were going forward with a
                    strategic defense initiative, but we still hadn't committed to deployment.</p>

                <p>In the world of nuclear weapons there were two for all practical purposes, only
                    two nuclear powers. It was the U.S. and the Russians each with some 6000 nuclear
                    warheads. The second tier of nuclear powers were Britain, France and China, not
                    one of which had more than two or three hundred nuclear weapons. The Chinese in
                    terms of the kind of long-range nuclear weapons that would threaten the
                    continental United States, had only about 20. So it was still very lopsided in
                    terms of the focus of our attention on who had the nuclear weapons and where the
                    threats to the United States would be. In terms of the energies of the
                    policymakers proliferation was a major concern and it was during this period of
                    time that the Indians and the Pakistanis were for the first time developing
                    nuclear weapons. They tested their first nuclear weapons in the spring of 1998
                    right before I went to work in the office. It was certainly one of our
                    responsibilities too to look at these emerging nuclear powers. Because of my
                    previous involvement and expertise on missile development, the threat posed to
                    the United States from other countries who were developing or who had long-range
                    ballistic missiles was a major part of our work at that time. I personally was
                    very much involved in a series of national intelligence estimates written on the
                    foreign ballistic missile threat, the first one in 1999. Then there was one in
                    2000 which was a subset of the major thrust of this yearly estimate that at that
                    time was oriented to how other countries were reacting to our strategic missile
                    defense plans and what the impact of the U.S. moving forward on that and getting
                    out of the ABM treaty would be. So both of those estimates took a lot of time,
                    and a lot of people were saying at the time that up until the Iraq national
                    intelligence estimates they were by far the most important estimates that were
                    done during those years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you see a change in raw intelligence that was
                        coming in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: I would say there was less of a change in raw intelligence coming in
                    than there was in the political spin that the agency put on the raw
                    intelligence. There was a reaction, I would call it an overreaction, in the 1999
                    estimate to the last time that the intelligence community had looked at this
                    subject, which was 1995. At that time they looked fifteen years out as they
                    usually do and said that in some senses the coast is clear here that North Korea
                    is the only country with the potential of getting a long-range sort of
                    intercontinental ballistic missile during that timeframe. They said some more
                    specific things about how North Korea would evolve. But what happened after the
                    1995 estimate was that the North Koreans tested a system, Taepodong I, in 1998,
                    which then in combination with the Rumsfeld condition report on the foreign
                    ballistic missile threat was kind of a team B alarmist version in reaction to
                    what they perceived as an overly sanguine intelligence community look in 1995.
                    The combination of that Rumsfeld commission report and the North Korean test
                    which involved some genuine surprise from the intelligence community because it
                    involved the third stage of the missile. It was actually a device to allow the
                    North Koreans to launch a satellite which failed. But the first and second
                    stages did not fail. I mean they were successful, and it raised all kinds of
                    alarm that any country which can put a satellite in space can essentially put a
                    warhead on the other side of the planet. That's sort of the physics of the
                    matter. It was that third stage and the space launched element which allowed
                    Rumsfeld and the highly defensive intelligence community to do a national
                    intelligence estimate, which took a major turn from what the intelligence
                    community had been saying in 1995. It did so by basically changing some
                    definitions and changing some criteria that were not evident to people other
                    than the specialists. As one example, the time in the evolution of a missile
                    system at which we say that the system is operational or to put it another way
                    that it actually constitutes a threat was changed to move up much closer to the
                    present time than it had traditionally. So all of a sudden in the way that
                    Rumsfeld, or the senior management of the national intelligence council
                    producing the national intelligence estimate, would talk about this these
                    countries that had been distant potential threats became within five years
                    threats. The Rumsfeld commission said that any country that had an
                    infrastructure that could produce a SCUD missile with a range of 300 to 600
                    kilometers could, within five years of a decision to do so, also produce an
                    intercontinental ballistic missile to throw a nuclear warhead, a claim which in
                    terms of the way it was presented I thought was preposterous. INR that I was
                    representing on the national intelligence committee basically said so. We
                    disagreed with the main thrust of both the Rumsfeld commission report and the
                    national intelligence estimate, which was unfortunately aping what the Rumsfeld
                    commission report said. So you had a little bit of the 1980 sequence of team B
                    taking over the intelligence community and getting it to do things against its
                    better judgement.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>From my point of view as a participant in this coordination process, which lasted
                    a period of months, what I saw was what I felt was a consensus around the table
                    by the CIA representative, the DIA representative, the Air Force missile
                    representatives and INR on what kind of things were likely. But somehow at the
                    end of the process, INR was all alone in an opinion dissenting from the majority
                    view. From my biased perspective, what happened was that the missile experts
                    were quite sober and consistent in what they said was technically feasible and
                    technically probable. The pressure by the Republican majority in the Congress
                    and a willingness of the senior leadership of the CIA were such that the
                    intelligence community basically delivered a product that was just what the
                    Republican leadership wanted in terms of justifying moving forward with
                    strategic missile defenses, jettisoning the anti-ballistic missile treaty which
                    would place limits on what we could do on strategic ballistic missile defense.
                    Again from my perspective I saw this as really a corruption of the objective
                    intelligence analytical process and I was of course not in a position to do much
                    about it other than to author part of the dissenting views that INR registered
                    when the 1999 estimate was produced. But I did certainly take note of when that
                    five years within which the Rumsfeld commission said we would be facing a world
                    of many more ICBM powers would be up.</p>
                <p>After I'd retired from the foreign service, I did a somewhat scholarly piece on
                    how wrong Rumsfeld and the intelligence community were. But, even while I had my
                    tour in INR, we could see that some of the alarmist predictions were not coming
                    to pass. One in particular that became public so I can talk about it is that the
                    intelligence community was predicting that North Korea would test an upgrade to
                    that Taepodong I system that so alarmed people. They would test a Taepodong II
                    that would not only have this highly theoretical potential of hitting the United
                    States but would actually have enough throw weight to deliver nuclear warhead to
                    at least Alaska, if not the Pacific Northwest. We dissented at the time and said
                    we didn't think you could say that was likely by the end of the year, by the end
                    of 1999 as they were saying. The end of the year came, it hadn't happened, and,
                    of course, still hasn't happened today that this system has been tested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was INR, I mean you but also the powers that be, were you
                        able to be independent or did you feel pressure?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: We only felt pressure around the table when the intelligence estimate
                    was being discussed. There's considerable pressure there. Some of it desirable
                    pressure to come up with a consensus document, to get rid of some of the
                    quibbling and to get something that is intelligible and coherent. So there is
                    certainly pressure to do that. But there was also a certain kind of pressure
                    around that table because you were dealing with the nation's leading experts on
                    missile aerodynamics, the NSA experts who through signals intelligence had made
                    determinations about capabilities. There's certainly readiness on the part of
                    others around the table to say, “well, who are you guys in the State Department?
                    We have the missile experts.” Or “we have the hundreds of people who have been
                    going through these technical analyses” and so forth. But I felt somewhat
                    resistant to that kind of pressure because I knew that we had been educated by
                    some of the same experts on what was possible. What we were really objecting to
                    was the way that the facts and the best judgement of the analysts were twisted,
                    misconstrued in the final product. A lot of it had to do with things as simple
                    as how you phrased the key judgments in the summary of an intelligence estimate
                    — not so much what was in the body of that top secret code word text but how you
                    presented it — how did you sanitize this for Congress and for the American
                    public? This estimate was sanitized and presented to the people and it said some
                    things which I judged to be misleading.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there any, I mean was there a sort of people
                        going at you one. Get with the program! Get with the political thrust! But
                        other ones with you looking them in the eye and saying, I understand what's
                        happened, but this isn't honest.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: There was; both of those views were expressed. In terms of the former,
                    it was a little bit easier to maintain an irascible minority position because
                    everybody knew this is what INR did. INR frequently had dissenting views, and we
                    really didn't care. We really didn't care if we were the only ones at the bottom
                    of the page saying “INR disagrees.” Of course from my point of view we were
                    strengthened in that because INR cares more than anything else about being
                    right. Historically speaking, I think INR's record of dissenting views, at least
                    in my experience and I obviously have seen only a small fraction of the
                    estimates during the period I worked there, but in terms of military technical
                    analysis, I would stack up our record about being right whenever there was
                    dissent. I would say we were usually right when look back historically. Our
                    emphasis was much more on what was likely to happen than what could technically
                    and conceivably happen. Some of this just has to do with the institutional
                    orientations and biases of the organizations. I understand and tolerate and
                    approve of the Defense Intelligence Agency being more interested in worst case
                    analyses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, they have to. This is what they're defending.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: That's right, and that the worst thing that can happen is for them to
                    have underestimated the potential threat and then to lose a war or put the
                    nation in jeopardy and so forth. But our institutional bias was in terms of
                    evidence and what was most likely to happen. We had to serve the senior
                    leadership of the State Department that was concerned with using our very
                    limited diplomatic resources to forestall likely threats to U.S. security and
                    not to orient our diplomatic establishment against what had some five percent
                    probability. So that was our bias, but it did result I thought in allowing us to
                    always emphasize or point out when the others were going beyond the bounds of
                    the probable and were misleading the consumers of these documents into
                    overreacting to something that wasn't likely to happen. So that is why I think
                    INR has historically developed a good record at being right or more right than
                    often the majority was and why, when INR once again was going to dissent on a
                    document, some of the others sort of shrugged their shoulders rather than trying
                    to talk us out of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, during the 1999 review, did Iraq come across your

                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: It certainly did come across our radar, and even the majority view
                    conceded that Iraq was not the first level problem. I mean North Korea and Iran
                    were both considered more serious problems than Iraq on the missile side of it
                    because Iraq was under extraordinary constraints. There was international
                    agreement that was fairly consistently abided by to deny Iraq components and
                    resources that were available to some of the other potential missile powers. The
                    United States had also demonstrated a willingness to attack the facilities in
                    Iraq as they did in Desert Fox in 1998 that were clear violations of what Iraq
                    was allowed to do. Iraq for example was under a restriction against developing
                    any missile with a range greater than 150 kilometers. The general missile
                    technology control regime restraints were 300 kilometers. So that's one of the
                    many examples that Iraq was under even tighter controls than other countries,
                    and that there were controls that were being enforced. So for all of those
                    reasons we at that point were all in agreement that Iraq was less of an imminent
                    danger than either Iran or North Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Pakistan at that time and India?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Pakistan and India were also mentioned in the agreement. Because of
                    their particular needs and because no one assumed that the United States was a
                    major target of their missile development programs, the need for a
                    intercontinental range ballistic missile, 5,500 kilometers, was not really seen
                    as being a driving factor. So we were charting the Indians and the Pakistanis
                    also in terms of their missile developments. But in their case it was more a
                    question of what kind of medium range or even intermediate range missiles they
                    were developing and they would have. But those tracks were also not exactly the
                    fast track.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened in 2000 and the laptop computer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Before I get to that, just let me mention the interesting thing about
                    the 2000 national intelligence estimate, which again did an update not only of
                    the ballistic missile threat but also in this case talked about the likely
                    reactions to the U.S. moving forward with its strategic ballistic missile
                    defense programs. This was also a very stormy estimate in which the drafters in
                    the majority seemed to have the basic attitude that no one could do anything
                    about the U.S. strategic ballistic missile defense program. Our allies in Europe
                    are not going to get out of NATO. No one in the world can really tell us not to
                    do something we want to do. Therefore, it's really no big deal. But I think that
                    we were successful in getting into the estimate the annex that pointed out that
                    virtually every country in the world had voted for the UN resolution which
                    called for the U.S. staying in the anti-ballistic missile treaty and that we
                    sometimes in dissenting positions would at least somewhere in the document
                    capture the concerns of many countries about where this would lead if the U.S.
                    moved forward with the program. So this was at least sufficiently sensitive.
                    This was all in response, by the way, to an explicit tasking by President
                    Clinton to the intelligence community to describe the likely reactions. The
                    president ultimately postponed going forward with the strategic missile defense
                    program on the original schedule. He said for technical reasons. But I have to
                    think it was partly because of some of the reality therapy that was provided by
                    this document in which we were fairly explicit about the diplomatic problems
                    that would be confronted if we moved forward. I took note of the fact that
                    unlike the 1999 national intelligence estimate, which included like a
                    sixteen-page public summary, there was no public summary of this one at all. I'm
                    just assuming that we didn't want to let the American public, the Congress and
                    the world know that we realized how unpopular this development program would
                    be.</p>
                <p>So anyway, going to the laptop. INR, having very little resources to buy new
                    equipment, really had no hope of getting a laptop, which seemed to be standard
                    issue at the CIA. But CIA with its abundance of funds gave INR some money to
                    have a couple of laptops, which were used. At least one of them was used to
                    perform a very valuable function. We had people from the policy community coming
                    down and spending time in our spaces, in the vaulted area, so that they could
                    prepare for interagency groups that would discuss intelligence on prohibited
                    materials being transferred to various countries. There was the missile
                    technology control regime. There were restrictions on chemical weapons and
                    chemical weapons components. These policies would have to start with the facts
                    the intelligence community was finding out about who was trying to ship what. It
                    was just part of the mechanics of handling the top secret information and who
                    could have what kind of machine in their office and how the pieces of paper
                    needed to be controlled to ensure that the people from the policy community
                    working on these documents would do so in the right places and wouldn't take the
                    documents with them and could not have access in the machines they were working
                    on to all of the other top secret information that INR computers had access
                    to.</p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>So what happened here was that they could on the laptop prepare top secret
                    information and cite individual report numbers and summarize the reports that
                    were going to be discussed at these meetings. They could have it on the laptop,
                    and it would be a closed system. So even though they were working with
                    top-secret information, there would be no access to other top-secret information
                    they were not authorized to have. It was kind of a neat, handy way to take care
                    of the administrative demands of intelligence, or so we thought at the time. But
                    this laptop was kept in the office, which was locked up at night, but it was
                    kept on a shelf where people would come down and work on it.</p>
                <p>We had some construction going on over a period of weeks and probably months in
                    which one wall was being knocked out. The size of our conference room inside the
                    vault was being expanded, and unfortunately this meant that there was sort of a
                    chaotic situation in terms of where the workmen were, where various things were
                    left in the office. So the very shelf on which the laptop was kept and the work
                    was done was removed in the construction process, and the laptop would move from
                    here to there and around the office. It was in the course of that construction
                    activity that one morning someone asked, “well where is the laptop?” No one
                    could find it. This didn't alarm people immediately because no one would've
                    thought this laptop would be in any place other than the office. But it started
                    quickly getting alarming when the laptop could not be found. I have to mention
                    here that this was the time when I was still in the strategic and arms control
                    division. So we basically didn't have anything to do with the laptop. I mean I
                    knew vaguely about it. I'd seen it around. I knew that people used it, but it
                    was the proliferation division that was really involved in all this. So I did
                    not quite have the involvement early on in the disappearance of the laptop. When
                    we in the office satisfied ourselves that it was not in the office, of course,
                    we reported to diplomatic security which then wanted to do its own investigation
                    before it confessed to the CIA and the wider intelligence community that we
                    couldn't find this laptop. But they couldn't find it either, and after talking
                    to all the people involved, they could not figure out where it had gone.</p>
                <p>Then the intelligence community got involved, and then the FBI got involved.
                    Before it was over, of course, this was a tremendous embarrassment to the State
                    Department because it was the third in a sequence of security problems, the
                    first being the disappearance of a big thick stack of top secret material from
                    the office of the Secretary of State. It was on the desk of one of her
                    secretaries, which I couldn't help but note was then awarded secretary of the
                    year later on even after it disappeared from her desk. Then the planting of a
                    bug by a Russian—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the paneling.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, in the paneling of a room. It was actually the office of the OES
                    (Oceans and International Environmental Scientific Affairs) conference room on
                    the sixth floor. I think this was where this happened. By the way, even though I
                    saw in the press that this room was not used for sensitive discussions, I was in
                    that room one week before all this came out to hear a presentation about nuclear
                    weapons design. So I don't think that story was exactly accurate. But both of
                    those things happened, and there was certainly not a consequence in terms of
                    anyone being fired or penalized or anything else. But when the laptop
                    disappeared, there was eventually disciplinary action taken against six people
                    including my boss and the security officer in our office. I won't get into all
                    the details. But it seemed to me somehow unfair in the grand scheme of things
                    that the bureau was by far the part of the State Department that took security
                    regulations the most seriously. We were always trying to enforce on the policy
                    people the CIA handling instructions that we had a responsibility to enforce and
                    were always sort of catching policy people for not doing what they should do,
                    and we were always kind of lecturing them. Then within INR I think that partly
                    because we had more top secret safes than anyone else and a whole lot of
                    technical intelligence and control of compartments and so forth, I would say
                    that our office was probably the office that took most seriously security
                    regulations. So it was not a place that I would call lax before all this
                    happened.</p>
                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>I still have no idea how it disappeared. The FBI has apparently given up on it
                    after having offered a $25,000 reward for several years running. I think they've
                    given up on the case. Certainly I've always wondered about a possible role the
                    people who were in our office doing the construction work might have played.
                    Also Robert Hansen the FBI spy, that is to say the Russian spy who was an FBI
                    agent, would regularly work down the hall from our office. He would be there
                    every week from the FBI as their liaison to the State Department. I always
                    wondered if there was a role there since he would've been someone who would've
                    seen this construction activity and could certainly have used it to tip off
                    people. But ultimately it was never found. We had multiple FBI searches of our
                    office. We contributed a chair. A chair against which the laptop was last seen
                    leaning was taken by the FBI for destructive analysis. We never got the chair
                    back. We were all interviewed individually by the FBI and then one day summoned
                    into a room and encouraged to sign a piece of paper allowing us to be
                    polygraphed on this matter. My boss had been removed from his job because of
                    this incident — sort of suspended pending the completion of the investigation.
                    So I was already acting office director at the time, didn't appreciate the way
                    the FBI had orchestrated this. They were supposedly just going to tell us about
                    the course of their investigation. Then it became a sort of, close the door and
                    here's a piece of paper to sign that you will be willing to be polygraphed. So I
                    asked some fairly unfriendly questions about whether there had been any change
                    in the determination that polygraph information is not permissible in court
                    because it is seen as an unreliable, unscientific method. They kind of
                    acknowledged that, and I conspicuously declined signing the paper in front of my
                    subordinates to try to give them some cover if they choose to do likewise. It
                    ended up that everyone signed the piece of paper except for the foreign service
                    officers in our office, and the investigations were conducted. The FBI did not
                    keep its word. It said that it would only ask questions relative to the
                    investigation and instead asked questions going back to people's early life,
                    have you ever done this and that. So I did not think this was one of the stellar
                    performances of the FBI. On the other hand, since we never found the laptop,
                    it's also a blemish on our office too, which can't really be erased because
                    ultimately we're responsible for maintaining our equipment. Whether what
                    happened was just or unjust, the main point was that, as someone who wasn't
                    directly involved in it and as a fairly senior division chief, I was asked to
                    take over as office director although I was still only acting office director
                    because I did not have senior foreign service rank. I was only an FS01. But in
                    May of 2000, I became the office director for what turned out to be a little bit
                    more than two years, the remainder of my time there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think this is probably a good place to stop. So
                        we'll pick this up in 2000 when you have become the office director after
                        the laptop thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is March 29th, 2005. Greg, when you became the office
                        director at INR, you were there up to the transition. Is there anything we
                        should talk about before the new team came on board?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: I think for INR the trauma of going through a transition is somewhat
                    lightened because in INR's case between the departure of Stapleton Roy as head
                    of the bureau and the arrival of the new political appointee Carl Ford, Tom
                    Finger, who was the principal deputy assistant secretary, stepped into the
                    acting bureau chief role. That represented such continuity and was so
                    comfortable that it was really about as seamless a transition between
                    administrations as could be imagined.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when Stapleton Roy left, he was sort of made the
                        fall guy in a way for this thing. Did that leave a lot of bitterness around,
                        I mean feeling—? Whenever somebody is picked out, you think administrations
                        sometimes like to toss somebody to the wolves. Does that leave an impact
                        around?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: It did. Let me go back a little bit and talk about the Stapleton Roy's
                    final days in the bureau. I had just a couple of months earlier had one of the
                    most enjoyable travels abroad of my career when I accompanied Stapleton Roy on a
                    trip to Australia, Japan and South Korea. Roy was going for consultations on
                    intelligence issues with the Japanese, the Australians and the South Koreans. He
                    brought two of us along, one of our East Asian experts and myself as a missile
                    proliferation specialist to make presentations in these consultative sessions
                    with our Australian, Japanese and South Korean allies. I was able to witness Roy
                    in action presenting U.S. perspectives on these issues when he had served so
                    much of his career in Asia. He had served as ambassador to China and as
                    ambassador to Indonesia. He had served earlier on in Moscow, was extremely
                    knowledgeable about issues and had a very rare historical approach to issues, a
                    sweep, a vision, a way of talking about what had happened decades before and
                    what was likely to occur decades in the future. You could see at almost every
                    stop the people listening to him — you could almost see their jaws drop because
                    this is just not the way they were accustomed to hearing U.S. views. I mean
                    usually it was the policy people with a very narrow perspective — what needed to
                    be done in the next few weeks. Many times the Americans had just arrived on the
                    job or were political appointees who were seized with the moment, ignorant of
                    what the dialogue between the U.S. and that country had been a year or two
                    before. So Roy was a very exceptional diplomat and analyst. It was a great
                    pleasure being with him.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>Now this is related to Roy's departure because Roy was planning a trip through
                    Germany, Eastern Europe and Moscow that he was very much looking forward to in
                    December. I guess this would've been December 1999. It was in the context of
                    making preparations for his departure from INR that he informed the Secretary of
                    State that he would be on this trip and that Don Keyser, his deputy who was
                    really his number two in the bureau, would be taking his place while he was
                    gone. Now Don was one of six people who had been cited for having some kind of
                    responsibility in the disappearance of the laptop. In Don's case it was really
                    kind of the captain of the ship model because he was the person who had been
                    there before Roy arrived. Roy was not there when the laptop disappeared, and Don
                    was supposedly held responsible for something that happened even though there
                    wasn't really anything specific to cite him for. He was under that cloud.
                    Stapleton Roy certainly had no loss of confidence whatsoever in Keyser, but
                    Secretary Albright said that it was really not acceptable for him to put Keyser
                    in charge of the bureau under these circumstances even for that temporary period
                    of time. This is all second hand of course, but my understanding is that Roy
                    told the Secretary that he had complete confidence in Keyser. He had
                    specifically chosen Keyser for that position when he came and if the Secretary
                    didn't have confidence in Keyser, then Roy felt that he couldn't continue to
                    serve in that position. So the Secretary allegedly said, “well, then you'll have
                    the leave the position.” That was really the background to Roy's rather abrupt
                    departure as head of INR.</p>
                <p>This was a big blow to the Bureau because I think most of us felt that Roy lent
                    considerable prestige and weight to the bureau. I mean most of us had a fairly
                    high opinion of the bureau with or without Roy. But he was just sort of icing on
                    the cake, considerable intellectual weight at the top of it. So his abrupt
                    departure I think gave a lot of us a feeling of what it must have been like
                    earlier in the 1950s during the purge of Americans from the State Department who
                    were allegedly not American enough during the House Un-American Activities
                    Committee era, the McCarthy era.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: McCarthy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: The ironic twist about that and one of the reasons I use it to say it
                    gives us a slight flavor of it, is that Roy was one of the young Americans who
                    grew up in China, the son of missionary parents with a native ability in
                    Chinese.</p>
                <p>John Service and John Patton Davies were some of the other foreign service
                    officers who were purged. A lot of us felt that this was really a political
                    purge that had nothing to do with Roy's capabilities. In fact he was, he was in
                    effect being purged for his loyalty to someone that he had a great deal of trust
                    in. So that was the nature of Roy's departure. It left a lot of very bad
                    feelings behind I think, feelings that the Secretary had for whatever
                    reasons—the suspicion was for political reasons, political survival
                    reasons—dumped one of the finest foreign service officers we had and someone who
                    some people felt would have been the logical successor, as one of the career
                    ambassadors for the number three position in the State Department.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, maybe I asked this before. But in case I didn't, I
                        take it that Secretary Albright and INR didn't fit too well somehow. I mean,
                        I've interviewed Phyllis Oakley who told me, she was there somewhat earlier,
                        but she was cut out of briefing Albright. They left it to the CIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Albright did not seem to have much of a personal connection with the
                    bureau and seemed not to rely on the head of the bureau. Neither Phyllis Oakley
                    or Stapleton Roy seemed to be in her inner circle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Going back to this trip you took, were you getting a feel
                        for the Japanese and South Koreans on missile development by North Korea
                        because for them this was sort of the soul of their existence. I mean, what
                        were the North Koreans up to? What were you getting from them or did we know
                        more than they did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: In some respects we did know more than they did, and there was
                    sometimes a delay in the Japanese getting information that they thought was
                    critical from us. In some cases it was information that we ourselves only
                    through analysis months after an event understood fully what the North Koreans
                    had done with missile tests. One in particular involved a Nodong missile that
                    actually overflew Japan or the water between the Japanese islands. That was one
                    of those cases that we ourselves didn't realize at the time when there was a lag
                    between the Japanese finding that out. Both in the case of Korea and Japan there
                    was considerable apprehension about the North Koreans. Ironically, the main
                    thrust of my remarks during the trip was to remind our interlocutors that some
                    of the tone they received from the CIA representing the U.S. intelligence
                    community did not reflect our own assessments of foreign ballistic missile
                    developments. That is we had a somewhat more sanguine — that's an overstatement,
                    but let's say a less alarmist view of what was going on in missile developments
                    than the majority opinion reflected in the briefings of the CIA and the other
                    presentations that our allies encountered. So obviously in the case of South
                    Korea and Japan, we were not going to try to talk them out of their anxieties.
                    But we were trying to present as objectively and as factually as we could the
                    pace of the North Korean program, the problems in their development program and
                    not to present or imply as likely developments things that we felt were unlikely
                    in terms of the speed with which the North Koreans could progress on their long
                    range missile development program.</p>
                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>Another part of this trip that I should mention though is, because of a
                    coincidence in time, we were actually in embassy Seoul at the time when the
                    first overland convoy to Pyongyang left the embassy. Just by coincidence I was
                    there on the day this convoy left the embassy and then proceeded through the DMZ
                    on its way to Pyongyang on the ground for talks that were setting the stage for
                    a later visit by Secretary Albright to North Korea, which in turn we thought at
                    the time were setting the stage for a presidential meeting with Kim Jong-il,
                    which we had the feeling at the time would actually have allowed for a deal on
                    stopping the North Korean long range ballistic missile program and their nuclear
                    weapons program. But of course the election intervened and President Clinton
                    spent his last weeks trying to get Middle East peace rather than trying to seal
                    a deal with the North Koreans. Conventional wisdom at the time certainly was
                    that the North Koreans would only make a deal if the president were personally
                    engaged. Then of course the presidency changed, and the new Bush administration
                    came in, and their approach to North Korea wouldn't be the Clinton approach even
                    though they weren't quite sure what it would be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you had the feeling that they backed out of all
                        Middle East stuff. They weren't going to get burned by that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If you let go it burns.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yeah, and the President repudiated Secretary Powell in I think March
                    of 2000 when he basically said publicly that the U.S. would continue to try to
                    engage the North Koreans. Within 24 hours the White House told the public that
                    that was not the case. Then by my accounts for the remaining portion of my time
                    in the State Department there was great incoherence in U.S. policy. Every time
                    coherence started to form, there would be opponents of whatever approach or
                    policy we wanted to adopt that would prevent it from jelling. In effect, the way
                    I would characterize it, there really was no Korea policy other than sort of
                    obstreperousness and derogatory remarks, public remarks on our part about the
                    nature of the North Korean regime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On that, John Bolton was very much in that, wasn't
                        he?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Well, he was. Bolton would publicly discuss the tyranny in Pyongyang
                    and both make comments and express policy perspectives that infuriated North
                    Koreans and led to them labeling him as human scum and other non-diplomatic
                    terms that were sort of probably a reciprocity for his own characterizations of
                    North Korea. We did get the feeling on Korea that of all of the issues in which
                    INR expressed its opinion of what was going on both politically and technically
                    almost, the most sensitive in terms of the new head of the bureau, Carl Ford,
                    were our views on the Korean nuclear program. I would not say that there was
                    really political pressure to change our assessments. But we got a lot of
                    coaching about the way we needed to say things so they would not be dismissed
                    out of hand by the consumers of the information in the White House and elsewhere
                    in the interagency communities. What it told analysts I think was that there
                    were such strong feelings about, let's say the inequity of the North Koreans or
                    the folly of seeking to negotiate with them that were clearly coloring the way
                    the information would be received. I'd probably have to concede in this case—and
                    this is one of the very few exceptions—that INR may have pulled its punches a
                    little bit — not so much at the analyst or office director level, but at the
                    senior INR level — about the way assessments of Korea were formulated because of
                    the sensitivities. One can say that that's one of the values of having someone
                    like Carl Ford in charge. He understood the sensitivities, but there's a little
                    bit of regret also that by pulling one's punches the information may not have
                    been as crisp or as easily understood as it should be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did Carl Ford come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Well, he had a background. I think he started out in Army intelligence
                    and he was in the CIA during the Reagan administration. I believe he was the
                    national intelligence officer for the Far East. So he had long experience in
                    Asia, and after the Reagan administration I believe he worked for Cassidy
                    Associates which was a firm doing work for Taiwan. So that was his
                    background.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean, did you feel, what was the feeling when he was
                        announced and first came on? Okay we've got a political — this thing is
                        going to get political?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0153" n="Page0153"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: There was a little bit of a feel for that as is really the case when
                    any political appointee comes in. But I think in an administration that was
                    perceived to be fairly ideological, there was even more concern that our
                    analyses would somehow be doctored or twisted by the new leadership of INR. That
                    really proved not to be the case. I think Ford although there were cultural and
                    stylistic differences at the outset and you had to make the usual adjustments to
                    the new person. I think it turned out to be in the end a good fit with INR, and
                    Ford I think won the allegiance of the bureau by first of all proving himself
                    feisty with regard to the other agency heads. Ford, by temperament, was
                    perfectly willing to argue a case that was a minority position, and I think Ford
                    also came fairly quickly to trust the analytical capabilities of the INR staff.
                    So it I think worked out as a fairly comfortable period under Ford. Most of us
                    felt most of the time that Ford was just like a non-political appointee in terms
                    of doing his best to represent what his professional career analysts had found
                    in monitoring and analyzing the intelligence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the relationship between
                        Secretary Colin Powell and INR?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: We certainly had the feeling that Powell had high regards for us, and
                    there were various alternatives. Obviously secretaries praise the bureau; they
                    praise all of their bureaus. So you never know how seriously to take that. But
                    there were other occasions in which we would have INR award ceremonies or other
                    things when both Powell and Armitage would show up and spend a half-hour or hour
                    with the bureau, and those were usually interpreted as events when he didn't
                    have to do that. He had a lot of competing demands on his time. It was felt at
                    the time that Secretary Albright would not have done that. It was noted that one
                    of the only times the bureau could remember Secretary Albright being in any
                    bureau offices was when she came to our office on a Saturday, I think it was, to
                    satisfy her curiosity about where the laptop had disappeared from and was heard
                    to make some derogatory remarks while going through the office by one of my
                    hardworking analysts, who was there working on a Saturday.</p>
                <p>So Powell gave every impression that he valued the analysis of the bureau. It was
                    as is often the case like looking through one of those two-way mirrors when he
                    knew everything that INR was thinking, but we didn't hear too much feedback on
                    what he thought on individual cases. Every once in a while he would openly
                    disagree with something. Other times he would write on the margin of reports or
                    give oral feedback that he thought something was a very good job. But I think we
                    could infer from the taskings and other things that he did value our input.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see an increasing gap between say INR and military
                        intelligence or the CIA as the Bush administration came in or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: I would actually say no. I say that because I was in the hot seat
                    representing INR in 1999 and 2000 when — and I'm realizing now that I may have
                    given the wrong date. Obviously the election was in the fall of 2000, and the
                    events that I was describing in terms of going to Asia were at the end of 2000.
                    Now I have to remember where I was. If you could repeat the last question?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'm just wondering, when the Bush administration
                        came in, you had Donald Rumsfeld who was a very strong Secretary of Defense.
                        There was a lot of ideology in other parts of the administration, not really
                        on the State Department, which I think worked to its detriment because it
                        wasn't playing the same game that the Pentagon was playing. CIA seemed to
                        get on board a lot quicker. I don't know. I don't want to make judgments
                        because I wasn't there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, and what I would say about that is that I had noticed in the
                    foreign ballistic missile threat assessments that I had been involved with in
                    1998, '99 and 2000, before the Bush administration came in, there seemed to be a
                    senior CIA inclination to fortify themselves against the fairly conservative
                    Republican leadership of the Congress, which was already moving away from what
                    one would've thought their desire to please the White House. So my specific
                    problems with the tone and the priorities and the somewhat faithless
                    representation of what the experts around the table were saying really started
                    before the Bush administration came in with what I thought was an over
                    responsiveness on the part of the CIA leadership to Republicans in Congress. So
                    in a way what I continued to see then in the first two years of the Bush
                    administration were a continuation of the subjects that I had dealt with on
                    foreign ballistic missiles and the WMD proliferation issues, a continuation of
                    what I thought was too much spinning and too much alarmist cow-towing to those
                    in Congress who had a particular agenda. What I didn't see at the time and what
                    was clearly happening was that Secretary Rumsfeld had created an intelligence
                    apparatus in the Pentagon which was apart from and in juxtaposition to his own
                    Defense Intelligence Agency experts. So it wasn't so much that the DIA and the
                    CIA experts at the analyst level were bending to the new winds coming out of the
                    White House but that the senior leadership of some of these agencies was
                    continuing to bend to the leadership of the Congress. There was a creation of
                    new entities in the Pentagon, the Office of Special Plans and another office
                    that, dissatisfied with what the experts, even defense intelligence experts,
                    were saying they were resifting the raw intelligence, cherry-picking and coming
                    up with a more extreme take which was then apparently channeled through Vice
                    President Cheney, and created in effect a stealthy team B inside the
                    administration that was outflanking what the career professionals were saying.
                    It had its most dramatic manifestation in the use of human intelligence on both
                    Iraqi weapons of mass destruction issues and the alleged connection between
                    Saddam Hussein and the perpetrators of 9/11.</p>

                <p>THIELMANN: Ironically it did not come up directly. During my entire time there I
                    did not even know about the existence of these offices in the Pentagon. I think
                    that speaks to the stealthiness of their activities. They were not appearing at
                    interagency coordination sessions where the intelligence community would be
                    trying to coordinate its position on analysis or registering the differing views
                    around the intelligence community about opinions. In effect they were not
                    submitting their analysis and their conclusions to peer review.</p>

                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: That's right. They were doing an end run around peer review because in
                    many of the sources they wanted to quote from or the reports they wanted to rely
                    on and report to the president were from sources that both the defense
                    intelligence analysts and the CIA analysts had deemed unreliable or proven
                    unreliable or suspected unreliable.</p>

                <p>THIELMANN: I would say that there really were not dramatic changes in the missile
                    situation during my last two years. There were changes in the perceptions just
                    as I was coming to the bureau in 1998 because of the August 1998 Taepodong I
                    test that shocked everyone.</p>

                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: The one that actually was supposed to launch a satellite but failed.
                    Since it was three stages and in some people's estimate would kind of be in the
                    category of an intermediate range ballistic missile it shocked people and gave
                    additional credence to the Rumsfeld commission report that had been released in
                    the spring of 1998. But in terms of actual developments the Indian and Pakistani
                    missile programs continued to move slowly forward. As regards the North Koreans'
                    program, after that one test, they never tested again a Taepodong I, and they
                    never tested the successor missile that the rest of the intelligence community
                    had judged would be tested in 1999. Instead they froze their testing and still
                    to this day have not tested anything more capable than that on the August 1998
                    test. During my last two years in INR people were predicting very dramatic and
                    early progress in the Iranian missile program moving forward. Instead during my
                    last two years, 2000 to 2002, we really just saw continuing work on the Shahab
                    III missile, which the majority of the intelligence community seemed to want to
                    label operational far earlier than the Iranians had worked out the problems in
                    the missile, some of the things that we tried in dissenting opinions to point
                    out from an INR perspective. So the real activity I would almost say, was in the
                    minds of hyperventilating congressmen and members of the administration because
                    they had their own agenda on strategic ballistic missile defense and wanted to
                    raise the alarms.</p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>One of the more dynamic developments that had actually taken place was that
                    Chinese shorter-range missiles were being moved off of Taiwan. This too was
                    something that during my time as office director responsible for analyzing these
                    issues, we saw in this case the Defense Intelligence Agency coming forward with
                    what proved to be an overly alarmist view on the speed with which China would be
                    deploying these missiles. That's something that INR took a dissenting opinion
                    on. Then when we got additional intelligence information that proved that to be
                    over alarmist, we had a heck of a time getting the National Intelligence Council
                    to take note of the new intelligence and to correct the conclusions that had
                    been reached on the basis of earlier analytical reporting. That was another
                    great lesson to me about how the intelligence community was always very eager
                    and moved very quickly when we got new intelligence that showed the threat was
                    greater than we had reported. But, when we got intelligence showing that we had
                    over-reported the threat, there was a great disinclination to register that or
                    to get any kind of information around to the consumers. It was almost as if we
                    had hoped that additional events would prove that original overestimate to be
                    accurate or that the actual events would catch up with some of the earlier
                    projections about what a potentially hostile state would be able to do. It just
                    showed me that the default setting of the intelligence community is on
                    overestimates, on exaggerating things for some understandable reasons because
                    the intelligence community gets really beaten up if something bad happens that
                    it hasn't warned about. So you can understand why, after getting beaten over the
                    heads and shoulders so many times in the past for missing things, it makes sure
                    that it doesn't miss anything by overestimating the kind of bad things that
                    could happen. Then it can always say well, see, we warned you this could happen.
                    So that's the inclination and default setting. But it doesn't work very well in
                    saving the taxpayers money by avoiding the U.S. building and deploying systems
                    that really aren't needed or in helping the State Department that's really
                    trying to deal with likely threats to hype threats that aren't very likely. It
                    can create a misallocation of some of our finite resources.</p>

                        influence? Were they another spoke in the whole wheel or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0158" n="Page0158"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: The intelligence committees really didn't pay much attention to INR.
                    We would often accompany the national intelligence officer or the head of the
                    CIA when they would go over and testify to congressional committees. This is
                    funny also because at least half the time we were not told that the CIA was
                    going over there speaking for the intelligence community as a whole. It would
                    somehow slip out or we would find out that they were going over and then kind of
                    hurriedly send one of us over there in effect as a truth squad to make sure that
                    they were not misrepresenting what the intelligence community as a whole said.
                    On one occasion I was representing INR in the back benches at one of these
                    sessions and the national intelligence officer made a reference to an INR
                    dissent on this particular issue. The congressmen were very puzzled, kind of
                    scratching their hair, well why would INR think that? In this case it was kind
                    of hard not to sort of turn it over to me to explain why INR thought that about
                    a particular country. But that was a really a very rare event. The members of
                    Congress and their staffs very rarely heard directly from INR about why we
                    analyzed things in a certain way. Having said that I saw a lot of examples of
                    fairly faithful representation of what our opinion was by the national
                    intelligence officers. So it wasn't that our opinions were constantly being
                    misrepresented. It was more that the thrust of a lot of the intelligence
                    assessments that Congress was being provided in terms of their presentation of
                    the prioritization of U.S. intelligence concerns and everything, I felt was
                    really not educating the Congress very well about what the line experts actually
                    felt was going on and not putting comparable threats next to each other or I
                    should say putting different threats next to each other so that the congressman
                    would understand the sense of priorities. The best example really was in the
                    National Intelligence Estimate on foreign ballistic missile threats but very
                    much in the fine print. It was the notion that it was really more likely that
                    someone could slip a suitcase bomb or a truck bomb into the United States than
                    the United States would ever be attacked with a ballistic missile with a nuclear
                    warhead. So that was an early reminder by the intelligence community — before
                    9/11 actually — that a terrorist threat or that kind of non-sophisticated threat
                    was really a graver concern or a more likely danger than North Korea or Iran
                    attacking the U.S. with a ballistic missile. But you sure wouldn't get that
                    impression from the way it was presented to Congress and the way Congress
                    reacted to this unlikely threat.</p>

                <pb facs="0159" n="Page0159"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes. I handed over the leadership of the office on July 3rd, 2002, and
                    so that really ended my period of directing the analysis on things like Iraqi
                    WMD. But it didn't quite end my knowledge about what was happening because after
                    taking a vacation, I went through the transition course. I spent much of
                    September then back in the office trying to clean out my safe and making sure
                    that all those various items that I'd been involved with were properly handed
                    over to someone else. So I was still in contact with and talking to the various
                    other people in the office, which has some relevance then as the Iraq WMD
                    intelligence war justification accelerated right after I left my office. I mean
                    it was August when Vice President Cheney made his VFW speech on the need for
                    regime change and the dangerous urgent threats that were occurring in Iraq.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To that group.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: End of August, while I was still in the transition course, but it
                    happened very quickly after that. End of August, Cheney's speech, early
                    September British dossier now known as the Dodge dossier. Then it was the
                    President's announcement to the UN General Assembly in late September that we
                    had intercepted aluminum tubes that were being used in the nuclear weapons
                    program. It was in September that Condi Rice started mentioning mushroom clouds
                    on the horizon, and we couldn't let them be the smoking gun. Then there was the
                    National Intelligence Estimate released in October 1st and somewhat
                    misrepresenting the line experts in assessing the threats. Things started
                    happening very quickly after that. Partly as a result of the U.S. military
                    threats, the Iraqis let the inspectors return in November of 2002. They were
                    quickly denigrated by senior U.S. leadership as being ineffective. The Iraqis
                    did their not very convincing report on what they had been doing. Then in
                    December of that year in a State Department white paper the issue of uranium
                    from Africa was mentioned. That's a whole mystery in and of itself since this
                    white paper would've had to have been cleared by INR. Even though I was out of
                    the office then, it became obvious later that this statement about why the
                    Iraqis did not mention that they were attempting to get uranium from Africa, was
                    not mentioned by the Iraqi voluminous report. An intelligence matter coming from
                    the State Department was not cleared by the State Department's bureau. So a very
                    odd thing. But since I'm already beyond when I was in the State Department, I
                    should probably maybe go back to what happened while I was there.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: I think it clearly had a shocking effect. Everyone has their 9/11
                    stories, but I'll just move through quickly what was happening in our office on
                    that day. There was one television in the office director's office, and one of
                    my colleagues told me that they had heard that a plane had crashed into the
                    World Trade Center. It may have come for the operations center, but because of
                    that news we had the television on. Several of the analysts were sort of
                    gathered around wondering what had happened. I think almost all of us assumed it
                    was a small plane that had crashed into the building. Because many of us were
                    watching at the time, we saw the second plane hit. I think it was almost
                    automatic. As soon as that happened, everyone assumed this was deliberate that
                    it was something very suspicious or something that would actually involve us as
                    a national security matter and not just be a matter of idle speculation or
                    something that happened in another realm of activity. Shortly after that, we
                    learned that the State Department was being evacuated, and it seemed to happen
                    very quickly. I'm not quite sure how many minutes elapsed, but at that point we
                    really didn't have much of an evacuation plan, and we of course tried to get our
                    classified material in the safes as quickly as possible. That was something
                    which later on we were actually directed from above not to be too punctilious
                    about — that life was more important than documents in this case. If we got an
                    evacuation order, everyone should get as soon as they could and merely lock the
                    vault and the lock on our outer office door and not worry about every safe and
                    every piece of paper in the office. But on the occasion of 9/11 we were all
                    being careful as we always were to make sure everything was locked up. So
                    everyone was rushing around doing that. I remember my wife called just as all
                    this was happening since she had heard about this and wanted to know what was
                    happening on our end. Whoever it was that answered the phone said that we were
                    all evacuating and that I couldn't talk now. Shortly after that the radio
                    reported that a bomb had gone off outside the State Department entrance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A car bomb, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: A car bomb or some sort of bomb. Of course this greatly alarmed my
                    wife, this sequence of events. It was very annoying to me after the fact because
                    I was making my way very slowly to her thinking that there was not reason for me
                    to rush to the subways. It would be oversubscribed, nor to get in long lines at
                    pay phones to try to reach her. She was of course imagining me dead while I was
                    making my slow way back to her. What had happened? It seems after the fact that
                    it was one of the F16s creating a sonic boom as they were overflying Washington

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I heard another version. I happened to be just getting off
                        the shuttle bus from FSI (Foreign Service Institute) when all of a sudden I
                        saw all these guards come running out of the State Department, out of the
                        entrance there just as I came down and developing the cordon. I was going
                        off to interview somebody somewhere else, and so I walked on, and all of a
                        sudden I heard sirens. I happened to have a radio with earphones and I was
                        listening and they said a car bomb had gone off. I thought “my God.” I just
                        was there and I didn't know that. But I'm told that they didn't have any
                        plan to say what happened, and the closest thing they had was to say a car
                        bomb went off. It would mobilize people to the proper extent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: So that was actually told people officially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I mean, well whatever it was, their plan for dealing
                        with the car bomb mobilized the State Department security people. It was
                        closest thing they could come up with. They didn't have something about an
                        airplane being crashed into you or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Well, whatever it was, it further created confusion and anxiety, but
                    what we did in our office was — I mean I was with several people — but our
                    instructions were basically to go home and call in to try to find out what
                    further instructions were. The interesting thing in terms of our office, we were
                    to my knowledge the first office in kind of a military way to develop a
                    contingency plan so that we had a place where we would reassemble a safe
                    distance from the State Department, count noses and decide on further action. We
                    were the first office in INR to really develop this, and I think it kind of
                    became a model for the rest of the bureau subsequently so we wouldn't be caught
                    with no plan as we were in this case. But on that particularly day everyone left
                    at that point in the morning and did report the next day. But one of the things
                    in my memory was how slowly the State Department reacted in terms of protecting
                    the building from what we thought at the time could be some sort of car bomb or
                    truck bomb follow up. At least in my memory virtually every other federal agency
                    put up concrete barriers and, in the case of the military agencies, had guards
                    with submachine guns before the State Department did. I think this was on a
                    Monday and for Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and Friday, it was basically
                    business as usual in terms of State Department security around the building. One
                    of my analysts, who had actually grown up in Lebanon, was sufficiently alarmed
                    by the laxity that he said he wasn't going to come in until the State Department
                    took the threat seriously. He wasn't going to return, which I didn't try to talk
                    him out of. I did use him in my conversations with diplomatic security to try to
                    get them to do something. I noticed then it was on the next Saturday that they
                    finally moved some security barriers in and removed us from being the most
                    tempting target by virtue of having the lightest security of any federal agency
                    in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your thinking? Within INR was the thought
                        turned immediately towards Osama bin Laden or was it turned towards Iraq or
                        Iran or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: I think it was turned very quickly toward Osama bin Laden. I don't
                    remember now how quickly INR had reached the conclusion that it was bin Laden,
                    but I think — and this wasn't my office's determination to make — but I think
                    our terrorism experts fairly quickly settled on Al-Qaeda as being the most
                    likely explanation. The main way that our office got energized on this issue was
                    related to the attack on Afghanistan because our office had to or felt obligated
                    to do an analyses of what the Taliban and Al-Qaeda in Afghanistan would likely
                    have in the way of weapons of mass destruction technology or expertise. It was
                    in this connection that we worked closely with the narcotics, crime and
                    terrorism office in INR to pool our efforts to find out what the terrorist
                    experts had to tell us about Osama bin Laden and Al-Qaeda and their access to
                    things. Then we had to tell them what we knew about the extent to which they
                    would be likely to have or to have gained access to the kind of expertise or
                    weapons that they would need in order to have a real chemical or biological or
                    nuclear weapons capability against first and foremost U.S. troops just going
                    into Afghanistan.</p>
                <p>It was because of my exposure at that point to the evidence that I could after
                    retiring then say publicly that the connection the administration was explicitly
                    and often implicitly making between Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein was not a
                    reflection of what the intelligence community was saying at the time because I
                    was very much aware of that in light of our own office's reporting analysis of
                    the likelihood of Al-Qaeda or the Taliban gaining access. Obviously one of the
                    first places you would think was well one of his neighbors that had a lot of
                    people in the country who knew how to make chemical weapons or biological
                    weapons and who had had a very active nuclear weapons program. So he was one of
                    the first likely suspects lined up intellectually speaking. It was then that I
                    learned that actually Osama bin Laden and Saddam Hussein were mortal threats,
                    that Saddam's secular regime was exactly the kind of regime that Osama bin Laden
                    wanted to replace, that Saddam as a somewhat paranoid dictator and all dictators
                    need to be somewhat paranoid in order to thrive and that supplying one of his
                    mortal enemies with this kind of material was one of the last things he would be
                    likely to do. So that was certainly our assumptions at the time and important to
                    our own assessment that Al-Qaeda was not likely to have the kind of biological
                    and chemical weapons that U.S. troops would have to seriously worry about. On
                    the nuclear side it quickly became obvious from the evidence that Al-Qaeda just
                    did not have the expertise. It was obvious before gaining any evidence that
                    terrorists groups like this are not well positioned to pursue nuclear weapons
                    developments. They would have actually to get a weapon in hand in order to be
                    able to use it. Their understanding of nuclear weapons proved to be pretty
                    rudimentary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you retired when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I actually retired on the last day of September of 2002.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You developed a career beyond that, didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: Well, a career of sorts. To this day in March of 2005, I have had no
                    salaried employment. I now am heading toward a job on the Senate Intelligence
                    Committee, which hasn't started yet. But what happened to me after retirement
                    was that I continued to make efforts within the constraints of security
                    restrictions to make the point publicly that the administration had not been
                    accurately reflecting what the intelligence community had been saying. This was
                    even what the intelligence community had been saying, which was already an
                    exaggerated rendition of what I thought the intelligence justified. But I
                    started telling this story of the senior leadership of the intelligence
                    community exaggerating what an honest analysis of the intelligence should have
                    delivered and then the administration further exaggerating that already
                    exaggerated intelligence product. This was all an effort to try to explain, on
                    my part to the public how the U.S. could get it so wrong, and it became evident
                    from the early days of the invasion that we had gotten it very wrong in terms of
                    whether or not Saddam had weapons of mass destruction and whether or not there
                    was a close connection between Saddam and the perpetrators of 9/11.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How then, would your stand manifest itself and what sort
                        of reaction were you getting from various elements?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Well, I guess the other point I would make is that in some speeches to
                    my alma mater Grinnell College first in October within weeks of my retirement,
                    in letters to my congressman, in draft op ed articles all before the invasion, I
                    had tried to make some of these points in a careful way so that I was not
                    spilling state secrets. But I was singularly unsuccessful in getting anyone's
                    attention. The Washington Post was not interested in my draft op ed in January
                    which pointed out how even the term weapons of mass destruction was misleading
                    people about the nature of the Iraqi inventory and the significance if they did
                    have biological and chemical weapons programs to any confrontation with the U.S.
                    or Iraq's neighbors. Then one week later, I'm sorry, one month later after
                    Secretary Powell's speech to the UN, I wrote an op ed with some specific
                    analysis of what Powell had said about the aluminum tubes and the uranium from
                    Africa, stories that were the core evidence to support the administration's
                    case. I mentioned for example Powell said nothing about uranium even though the
                    President of the United States had just mentioned it in his state of the union
                    speech eight days earlier. I noted how significant it was that the Secretary of
                    State said nothing at all about one of the two pillars of our nuclear weapons
                    charge, which was by far the most significant charge about the danger of Saddam
                    Hussein. I pointed out this was probably because the Secretary of State thought
                    that this was such a bad case partly because INR had told him that but moreover
                    because I think he realized that a lot of others in the intelligence community
                    thought it was a weak case as well. This was obvious since George Tenet had sent
                    a memo to the NSC in October and at a phone call to the NSC in October warning
                    them not to use this charge in a speech the president was giving.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: George Tenet, the—</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: The director of Central Intelligence — not to use this charge in a
                    speech the president was giving in Cincinnati, Ohio on October 7th. So that op
                    ed was also rejected even by the Des Moines Register, an Iowa boy giving them in
                    effect an inside scoop. It quickly became evident that the press was far too
                    gullible about its briefings from the CIA, inside backgrounders from the CIA,
                    was very excited about the upcoming game or so it seemed on CNN with all of its
                    music of the upcoming invasion. The Congress too seemed to be terribly
                    disinterested even after the UN inspectors had returned and were gathering
                    evidence on the ground to fill in some of the gaps we had had and to resolve
                    some of the ambiguities about what was happening under those roofs that our
                    satellites had picked up or to what use those dual use chemicals were being put.
                    The Congress never asked the intelligence community as far as I can see to
                    update them on what we had learned by the presence of UN inspectors on the
                    ground or what the significance was of Iraq reversing what was really the only
                    smoking gun which was the testing of missiles in excess of the 150 kilometer
                    range the Iraqis were allowed. Incredibly the Iraqis agreed to that under the
                    threat of use of military force, and we were eliminating their entire arsenal of
                    illegal weapons. But none of this seemed to have any impact on the Congress or
                    seemingly on the press. It was only after the invasion and after U.S. forces
                    failed to find any weapons that I got a call from one of the journalists that I
                    had been pestering to ask me to say more about my take on how this intelligence
                    failure had occurred. That was Nicholas Kristoff at the New York Times in late
                    May, who mentioned me in one sentence in an op ed he had written. That
                    precipitated a flood of press inquiries from various countries and from all over
                    the U.S. to ask me more. I found myself to be really I would say the only
                    official through July of 2003 who had seen all the top secret information and
                    who was willing to say that what the administration was saying was not
                    consistent with the intelligence provided. That was a pretty lonely position to
                    be in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a problem when all of a sudden people started
                        listening to you and they tend to cluster together? I mean it's a pack
                        instinct, and all of a sudden you're somebody who they can get a few lines
                        from, talking about the news media and all. Did you have a problem to get
                        them to concentrate on what you really were saying and not try to run off
                        and make the meat rarer or rawer than it actually was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, there was occasionally that kind of problem, and of course they
                    would fixate on one or another thing that I had said that seemed like a juicy
                    line and then replay that a lot or overemphasize it. So one of the things you
                    learn is that when you're responding to the press, you're not exactly telling
                    the story with the perspectives and the emphases that you would like to see or
                    have in your own head. That's one of the things that motivated me to write an
                    article to the Foreign Service Journal about this sort of coming out from behind
                    the curtain and the life of dealing with top secret information but not never
                    talking to the public about it. I had the good fortune to be invited by the Arms
                    Control Association to participate in a press conference in July.</p>

                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: This is 2002, in July — to get a coherent package on the record so
                    there would be a transcript of my own explanation of how the U.S. got it so
                    wrong. That was fortunate because in subsequent interviews, the press could deal
                    with one aspect or another, but at least I could refer back to my own words on
                    what I thought the big picture was.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any effort on the part of people still in

                </p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>THIELMANN: I think a lot of this was kind of in my own head. You're really very
                    deep into INR culture INR of avoiding any contact with the press. I think that
                    the foreign service as a whole is a little bit too deep in that avoidance of the
                    press and contact with the public. I would note that a lot of other foreign
                    diplomatic corps have much more integration in terms of getting their young
                    diplomats as press spokesmen for embassies and that kind of thing, so that
                    there's more familiarity with the public relations side of foreign affairs. But
                    in the U.S. I think traditionally, and we'll see what happens a few years down
                    with the integration of the former U.S. Information Service and the diplomatic
                    establishment, we'll see if the barriers are torn down a little bit. But I think
                    that we as foreign service officers are trained not to talk to the press at all.
                    That's the main way you can stay out of trouble. Just don't talk to them at all.
                    Don't talk to the public in terms of speeches because it can only do bad things
                    for you. It's not career enhancing. It will just set off mines that will wreck
                    your career. So those are very strong lessons. One of the things that means is
                    that, if you retire and you start talking to the press about it, you not only
                    have the anxiety about maybe stepping over the line in terms of saying something
                    that is not just a bureaucratic secret but a genuine national security secret.
                    But you also have that very strong sort of against the grain cultural pull that
                    I am betraying the band of brothers here. I am doing what the members of the
                    team did not do and looked down on. So there's a lot of worry and anxiety about
                    whether or not your colleagues, your friends, your community is going to think
                    ill of you or think that you are either grandstanding and involved in some sort
                    of ego trip or else you're being totally irresponsible in terms of the nation's
                    business. So there was a lot of that kind of anxiety, but I have to say that in
                    terms of any direct feedback I didn't get a lot of negative feedback. I would
                    hear either directly or indirectly from some of my former colleagues that I had
                    not said or told one piece of the story exactly right. They would find often
                    times that it was a reaction to the way the press reported on what I had said
                    and that I could often assure them that what I had said was actually something
                    they would have been comfortable with hearing but the press didn't get it quite
                    right. But the fear of doing something that my former colleagues would not think
                    highly of was certainly one of the things that slowed down my willingness to
                    talk publicly and made me more circumspect than looking back on it I wish I had
                    been. I wish I had been a little more explicit before the invasion occurred and
                    a little bit more aggressive in trying to get my version of the story out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Secretary Powell during this
                        time? He had become a great hero of the foreign service by paying attention
                        to it as a former military officer learned to take care of his troops unlike
                        practically any other Secretary of State. So he had that, and also he seemed
                        to be on the right side of issues, but the Bush administration was not. But
                        he seemed to have sold out or something. One has the feeling because of this
                        whole episode of appearing before the UN and essentially putting his
                        prestige on the line and his presentation proved to be basically false.</hi>

                <p>THIELMANN: I would certainly subscribe to what you said about the reasons for
                    Powell's popularity. I really think that almost without exception everyone felt
                    good working for Colin Powell — working under him as Secretary of State. He had
                    a fantastic way to praise people for the work that they were doing to make them
                    feel part of the team, to reach out to everyone associated with the State
                    Department, whether they were the senior policy maker or a janitor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, he even talked to me at a reception.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: There you go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We had thirty seconds of conversation about oral history.
                        Before, I never in my entire thirty year career in the foreign service
                        talked directly to the Secretary of State other than shaking his hand.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: He had incredible charm I thought, and he put everyone at ease who was
                    around him. So it was really a great period to be part of the State Department.
                    I think most of us also saw that he had a very high common sense quotient, that
                    he had a very good feel for talking to foreign leaders and how to talk with
                    them, just as he did to us. So a lot of us saw him as an effective diplomat in
                    that way too. He did not create any enemies through his manner of dealing with
                    them. The exact opposite of John Bolton who antagonized people who might even
                    have been in agreement with what he was saying. So it was because of all that
                    high regard, it was much more in sorrow than in anger that we saw the Iraq
                    invasion lead Powell into places that he shouldn't have gone to do things that
                    he should probably be ashamed of himself for doing. Our assumptions at the time,
                    and by that I mean really throughout my period as office director, 2000-2002,
                    was that Powell wanted to avoid unilateral action, that he was genuinely
                    interested in the UN security council resolutions being carried out, and Saddam
                    Hussein contained, not removed from power. We assumed that this was an uphill
                    struggle perhaps because of the others in the administration that had a much
                    more ambitious agenda in the case of Iraq. But even though we didn't get a lot
                    of direct feedback on, or even indirect feedback, on the nature of his
                    conversations behind closed doors, our assumption was that he was the voice of
                    reason on this issue, on many issues in heated arguments with a bunch of
                    ideologues who had no good feel for the damage that would accrue to U.S.
                    relations with many other countries in the world if they were to prevail in
                    policy preferences. That was our assumption about Colin Powell.</p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>When we heard through I guess Carl Ford, our bureau chief, that Powell said he
                    wanted to be the smartest man in the room when the subject of Iraq came up, we
                    thought that this was one of the easiest tasks we'd ever had because he was
                    already the smartest guy in the room. He was already someone who had been
                    chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff during Desert One who had a lot of
                    experience professionally both at the NSC and afterwards with the very issues
                    that were on the table during the lead up to the Iraq war. Powell had the
                    knowledge of weapon systems, which made it a much lower order of difficulty in
                    sending him memoranda and analyses on these subjects. We didn't have to waste
                    time as we would — I don't want to say waste — we did not have to take the time
                    or take the space that we would use for other Secretaries of State explaining
                    what this kind of weapon system was or how military units worked or anything
                    like that. He was for our office, the perfect consumer of information because he
                    knew all this stuff. He knew it as a soldier, as a previous consumer of this
                    kind of detailed information. So we thought we had sort of the best cabinet
                    member in town for those meetings. We had the best consumer of our information.
                    We had someone who had a natural sympathy for what we saw from the facts up kind
                    of analysis. We felt that he was someone who wanted to know what his experts
                    thought about issues, and then he would do often the logical thing in making the
                    best, most commonsensical policy recommendation. So that's the background.</p>
                <p>We also thought by the way that he was very unhappy with Undersecretary Bolton,
                    that he did not agree with Bolton's predilection on arms control and other
                    issues. But he was really constrained in the fact that Bolton was the White
                    House choice for the job and had very powerful backing by Vice President Cheney
                    and Secretary Rumsfeld. So that Powell felt he didn't really have much of a
                    chance, he didn't have much choice in taking Bolton originally. What
                    conventional wisdom was in the State Department, what we had heard and assumed
                    was that Powell was keeping book on Bolton's various outrages. We felt, month
                    after month, Powell was one day going to go to the President and say, “I can't
                    have this guy in my Department subverting my policies and your policy, Mr.
                    President.” That was our assumption, and we were wrong in that just as we were
                    wrong in making assumptions about what Powell would not be willing to do for the
                    president in selling his Iraq policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>But I wanted to mention a specific that I can talk about better with hindsight
                    about what was going on. This involves something that happens in March 2002.
                    This was really at a time when we were still reporting as we always were on what
                    we thought the Iraqis were doing for various illicit efforts or in programs that
                    they were prohibited by UN Security Council resolution, by international treaty
                    or some sort of international regime. This was at a time when we got one of
                    those taskings from the Secretary of State, delivered through I think Carl Ford,
                    but might have been through his principal deputy Tom Finger, with a tasking to
                    us as the office that monitored how Iraqi WMD programs were doing and was the
                    institutional source of knowledge on the history of the inspections program. Our
                    office and another office, the Near East South Asia office of INR were tasked
                    with coming up with an inspection scheme which Saddam Hussein would reject. I
                    was flabbergasted to get this task. I remember sitting in an office and taking
                    notes and nodding my head and leaving the office and then an hour or two later
                    sending an email to the head of the other office director involved asking him
                    whether he heard the same thing I did — that we were basically asked to design
                    an inspection scheme that was designed to fail and that would fail in getting
                    Saddam Hussein to eliminate his weapons of mass destruction. It was confirmed by
                    this other office director, that yes, that's what we were asked to do. I
                    remember communicating by email to our front office saying that I refused to
                    carry out that task. I don't know if I had any right to refuse to carry out such
                    an order. But I just thought it was just so immoral and so dishonest to be
                    allegedly designing an inspection regime that was supposed to enforce the UN
                    Security Council resolution but in fact was doing something which was presumably
                    designed to give us an excuse to overthrow Saddam. This was in March of 2002. I
                    look back on that and I have to think that this was Colin Powell who knew
                    apparently from the fall of 2001, shortly after 9/11, that the U.S. was bound
                    and determined to overthrow Saddam Hussein. This was Powell's effort to try to
                    make that happen with the least damage to our relations with other countries,
                    that is to be able to blame it all on Saddam through some sort of obviously
                    unacceptable rejection of UN inspection regime. But that was just a little bit
                    too much for me. In my email response, I was trying to be responsive and
                    helpful, and I said, we will try to outline an inspection regime that will be
                    sufficiently rigorous that we can have high confidence of knowing that Saddam is
                    not pursuing the various weapons of mass destruction programs. This regime may
                    very well be sufficiently rigorous that Saddam Hussein will reject it, and we
                    can give you an assessment of that likelihood also — I mean, we in conjunction
                    with our Iraq experts in the other office. But I'm not going to suggest a regime
                    that's designed to fail in its stated purpose. That was really the way the
                    matter dropped. We did the project as it was redefined. We gave a lot of
                    specifics to our front office in terms of what an inspection regime would look
                    like that had sufficient confidence or would give us sufficient confidence that
                    the Security Council resolutions would be carried out. This is something that I
                    have not talked to the press about partly because I guess I did not want to
                    create inquiries to my colleagues both laterally and above me on something that
                    was ultimately never really carried out in the way that it had been tasked. But
                    it does tell me, I have to say that, this must've been something if I can
                    believe the people who tasked me with the project that Colin Powell came up
                    with. That was a disappointment to me as was his UN speech. My final thought on
                    that March 2000 event was that within the last week and a half the BBC had aired
                    a documentary on Panorama which quoted from a leaked memo that the UK ambassador
                    sent from Washington that same month in which he was reporting on the U.S.
                    determination to get rid of Saddam and the need to, as he put it, wrong foot
                    Saddam in terms of the inspection — wrong foot meaning to trick, to out maneuver
                    him — and it's very hard for me not to associate that with exactly what had come
                    down to us as a tasking from Secretary Powell.</p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>So that was one of my disappointments about the Secretary. But the other very big
                    one was what he did in February of 2003 in his 85-minute elaboration to the
                    other members of the Security Council, about what the U.S. intelligence
                    information said about what the Iraqis were doing. It wasn't so much the
                    specific information that Powell gave that I found offensive because in many
                    cases he was reporting on fairly hard evidence about what we had seen. For
                    example, we did intercept aluminum tubes that were bound for Iraq. Powell
                    characterized the tubes accurately in terms of them being high strength
                    aluminum. We did know that various precursor agents were going into Iraq that
                    could be used in the making of chemical weapons. We did know about new
                    construction activity at sites that had previously been associated with WMDs. So
                    it wasn't so much the many the individual pieces that Powell was reporting. We
                    did have those intercepts of kind of questionable comments prior to UN
                    inspections. Many things were true that he conveyed, but what he said in and
                    around the margins, that were facts. “We have multiple sources.” All of those
                    things that he said that helped emphasize or in my retelling helped mislead
                    people about how you would put all this together or what these facts actually
                    showed us. That was very disappointing because you can only see it in retrospect
                    as a very skillful and slick oversell job, which certainly worked very well with
                    the American press and with the Congress at the time. It didn't work so well
                    with the foreigners, particularly those who knew the subject matter and knew the
                    nature of his game. But most deeply disappointing of all was what he said about
                    the aluminum tubes, during which he acknowledged that there was a dispute that
                    experts differed on what they thought these aluminum tubes were going for, which
                    was interesting since when the president brought it up in September, he didn't
                    acknowledge any difference at all. He acted as if the mere fact that these were
                    aluminum tubes, sophisticated aluminum, meant that they were going into the
                    weapons program. But Powell first of all rejected what we had told him more than
                    a year earlier that the Department of Energy and the leading experts in the
                    United States said that these tubes were not suited for nuclear weapons program.
                    That he basically sided with the White House and the CIA was disappointing but
                    maybe understandable because of his political position. What was inexcusable on
                    our part was the details that he gave here. I'm just a simple soldier, but he
                    noted the U.S. did not use this kind of aluminum in our own artillery rockets,
                    which is what we said they were being used for and what we now know they were
                    being used for. He said the U.S. doesn't use this kind of aluminum, and he
                    talked about a lot of other things, which made it convincing to the layman that
                    yeah, that's really suspicious. But what he didn't mention was that we knew at
                    the time that the Iraqis had reverse engineered an Italian-designed artillery
                    rocket that used exactly that kind of aluminum, and in fact the U.S. did in some
                    of our rockets use that kind of aluminum. If not artillery rockets then in
                    helicopter-borne rockets that were used for some of the same targets. So that
                    was disingenuous if not completely dishonest. That was very disappointing. That
                    was really Colin Powell banking on his integrity and credibility, which were
                    considerable.</p>

                <p>THIELMANN: And misleading people if not telling them fibs on very critically
                    important issues that any nation or any international community needs to inform
                    itself about.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before going to war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Yes, that's right. So to me that permanently blots Colin Powell's
                    legacy, and there's really no way that he can sort of wriggle out of having done
                    something that was irresponsible in the extreme. I think that in his own mind,
                    and this is armchair psychology, I don't think he knew or fully realized the
                    extent to which that he was really telling fibs. I mean he knew that he was
                    really stretching the truth as far as it would stretch and beyond. But I think
                    he was genuinely disappointed with, if not extremely angry with, George Tenet in
                    the CIA who he had relied on totally in those final days to at least keep him
                    out of too much trouble. I think that he thought that he was operating in safer
                    grounds in his spinning than he actually was. From what I've heard up until the
                    time Tenet resigned he was still asking Tenet to explain himself in terms of the
                    material that he was presented.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel during this time or anything the hand of
                        Condoleezza Rice, the head of NSC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: I certainly didn't feel her personal hand except that I felt that at
                    the very least, her level of involvement was inadequate given the importance of
                    the intelligence community's assessment of the main justification for going to
                    war, for leading a nation to war. That Condoleezza Rice would admit that she
                    never read the INR dissent is not just insulting because I was part of INR but
                    it's insulting to me as an American that the president's national security
                    advisor would not read a conspicuously lengthy and strong dissent on the most
                    important piece of the most important intelligence document on the most
                    important justification for in effect a declaration of war. That seems to me
                    unbelievable that she would not inform herself of what her experts were thinking
                    about. Then of course that she would go beyond that. But to start characterizing
                    in very inflammatory ways the significance of the intelligence document to talk
                    about mushroom clouds and to make the misstatement at a very critical time that
                    the only thing that these seized aluminum tubes could be used for is nuclear
                    weapons, is just flat 100 percent wrong. That really to me gets into sort of a
                    high crime and misdemeanor rather than just bureaucratic sloppiness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Greg, I guess this, we might close at this
                        point.</hi>

                <p>THIELMANN: Let me just say one more thing, Stu. When I reflect back on my two
                    years as office director and what issues we dealt with that were really the
                    gravest threat to the U.S., it's hard not to mention the India-Pakistani
                    confrontation over Kargil and the fact that we had one million men in arms
                    mobilized confronting each other on a border with both countries in possession
                    of nuclear weapons. It was one of the things that our office was involved with
                    on a day-by-day and week-to-week basis to try to keep our superiors informed on
                    what we thought was going on in terms of how close the nuclear apparatuses of
                    both nations were. I just mention this because thinking back on it, it was one
                    of those ways in which I think our system worked very well. I think that we were
                    providing a lot of good intelligence on this subject. You had significant
                    involvement by Deputy Secretary Armitage and Secretary Powell on trying to
                    contain the dangers to the international community on engaging the Indians and
                    the Pakistanis at very high levels. I just mention that since so much of our
                    conversation has been about failures and disappointments that here is one of
                    those U.S. diplomatic involvements that I think did very good things for the
                    world and ended not with a bang but perhaps with a whimper, which is the way you
                    certainly want it to end. That left me with a very good feeling about our
                    office's contributions and the contributions of the State Department on a
                    critical international issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the contribution work? In other words what did we
                        do that kept the thing from going out of control?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>THIELMANN: Well, I think what we were doing was the South Asian experts in the
                    office of Near East South Asian affairs would team up with our experts on the
                    Indian-Pakistani militaries and the nuclear proliferation experts to do what I
                    think at one point were daily Sit Reps (situation reports) and regular reporting
                    when we would get significant intelligence information to make sure that our
                    principals knew how this slightly changed or added to our understanding of what
                    was happening. So that again made Powell and Armitage very smart and up-to-date
                    when they had direct conversations with the leaders. This involved travels to
                    the region, but also a lot of phone calls most of which we didn't hear a lot of
                    feedback about in our office. But we had to assume that they were more
                    productive discussions because Powell and Armitage were much more on top of what
                    was happening militarily in a region of the world that frankly doesn't get
                    nearly as much scrutiny as Europe and the Middle East and a lot of other areas
                    of the world.</p>
