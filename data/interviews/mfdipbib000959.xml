                <p>An interview with Samuel S. Rea</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: W. Haven North</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: April 24, 1998</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is April 24, 1998, and an interview with Sam Rea,
                        who served with AID for how many years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: For thirty years, from 1966-1997. This includes 18 months away to finish
                    graduate school.</p>
                <p>Preparation: Early years and education</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's start off with where you are from, where you
                        grew up, education, and anything that would indicate how you got into
                        international development rather than something else.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: I joined AID to work on Africa. The question, I guess, is: why Africa?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's go back to where you were born and where you
                        grew up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: I was born in New York City in 1938. After the War, when my father came back
                    from the Navy, we moved to Pittsburgh, the family seat, where he had grown up. I
                    went to Shady Side Academy locally from third through ninth grade. I then moved
                    on to spend four years at Andover, north of Boston. There I was fortunate to be
                    chosen for an English Speaking Union fellowship for a year at a “public school”
                    in England. I came back in 1957 to take four years at Princeton, and then went
                    immediately on to graduate school in African studies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything in those early years beyond your time in England,
                        that would suggest why you were interested in international affairs, world
                        affairs and so on?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>REA: I've often wondered why the travel bug bites one person and leaves others
                    alone, even close siblings. In my case, the bug bit. My family's overseas
                    experience was contagious. Both my father and mother, and close relatives on
                    both sides of the family, loved to explore far-off places. My parents had first
                    met in Beirut and following their engagement there, had traveled to East Africa.
                    At college my role model was my great uncle, then a man of about 70 years old,
                    who had retired to Princeton. He was an Arabist, and had served as the president
                    of the American University of Beirufor a quarter century between 1923-1948.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Bayard Dodge. Uncle Bayard was a delightful man, and we had time to talk and
                    take long walks together. My sense was that it was not in the cards for me to
                    work as he had done in the Middle East. My Arabic was nil, and he reckoned that
                    it took the average person 12 years to speak Arabic perfectly. I was too
                    impatient for that! BuI did have some grounding in French. As it happened, 1960,
                    my junior year at college, was the big year of African independence. Few
                    Americans then, as now, knew much about Sub-Saharan Africa, and the needs there
                    were enormous. So it seemed to me, equipped as I was with only English and
                    French, that my opportunity to make an international contribution was in
                    Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anything in the Princeton experience that
                        pointed you toward development in Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: I came to Princeton with the idea of joining the Woodrow Wilson School in my
                    junior year and studying public affairs. But after my first history course as a
                    freshman, I decided to major in Modern European and American history. The
                    history department then, as now, was one of the best in the country. R.R. Palmer
                    was my professor on the French Revolution and was then half way through writing
                    his two volume study, The Age of the Democratic Revolution. His course helped
                    reinforce in my mind some of the events of my year in England, especiallGhana's
                    Independence celebration, the first in Sub-Saharan Africa. I also took Fred
                    Harbison's course on economic development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was on the Nigeria manpower mission?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>REA: That's right. Harbison had been a member of the Ashby Commission in Nigeria,
                    and had prepared a manpower plan which was at the time the state of the art. He
                    was a very contagious person and an enthusiastic advocate for whatever he did.
                    Princeton requires every senior to write a thesis, and at the time he came back
                    from Nigeria I was looking for a topic to write about. I wanted something at the
                    near end of the historical spectrum which would permit me to use original source
                    materials and which was related to Africa. I finally ended up writing about
                    British education policy in the Gold Coast as an aspect of imperialism. The
                    source material I found at Teachers College Columbia University, which carried a
                    full file of all the British Colonial Office education reports going back to the
                    beginning of colonization there. My thesis advisor was Gordon Craig, professor
                    of European diplomacy, known particularly for his work on German history. In
                    1960-61, Professor Craig came nearest to an African expert of anybody then
                    serving on the Princeton faculty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why Africa? Why not some other part of the world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Post-independence Africa was where the line was thinnest. It was the area of
                    the world at the time with the greatest need and the fewest knowledgeable people
                    to help.</p>
                <p>In my senior year I began to prepare quite deliberately for my Africa career. I
                    applied to graduate school at the Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International
                    Studies (S.A.I.S.) in Washington. S.A.I.S. was at the time one of the first and
                    among the few schools to offer African studies at the post-graduate level. But I
                    wanted to experience at least a piece of Africa on the ground before starting to
                    study Africa from books. One day when I was doing research at Teachers College
                    for my thesis, I was thinking about how I could manage this. An item on the T.C.
                    bulletin board caught my attention anI walked down the hill to James Robinson's
                    Church of the Master in Harlem. There I signed up to participate in Operations
                    Crossroads Africa, Robinson's summer work program then entering its third year.
                    I spent that summer after graduation, 1961, with a twelve person group of
                    college students. We traveled widely in Mali before joining with Senegalese and
                    Gambian university students to lay the foundations of a primary school at
                    Popenguine, a pretty coastal village south of Dakar. Weeks after returning I
                    enrolled at S.A.I.S. in September, 1961. There I spent my next two years
                    studying Africa, along with various required courses in economics and
                    international law.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any particular major?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>REA: I majored in African studies. S.A.I.S. permitted a major in a geographic
                    area of interest. We looked at Sub-Saharan Africa from an interdisciplinary
                    perspective: history and anthropology (with Robert Lystad), diplomacy (Vernon
                    McKay), and country and regional politics (with, for example, the State
                    Department's expert on West Africa, Robert Baum). In addition to the area
                    studies, I took courses in complementary subjects such as development economics
                    (with Isaiah Frank), trade and commerce, international law, and U.S. diplomatic
                    history. I also satisfied the foreign language requirement in French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you write a thesis then, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: S.A.I.S. required second-year students, then as now, to do a long paper of
                    75-100 pages. I wrote mine on the foreign policy of Senegal, as the African
                    country I then knew best. I should also mention that between my first and second
                    year at S.A.I.S., I spent the summer at American University writing the
                    “government and politics” chapters for the Department of Defense's Area Handbook
                    on the Ivory Coast.</p>
                <p>By the time I had completed my Master's degree in June 1963, I had been in school
                    for 18 straight years. I had decided to go on to a Ph.D., but felt that I needed
                    to clear my mind before I continued with an even more demanding course of study.
                    Since childhood I had had a special admiration for the Marine Corps. I joined
                    the U.S.M.C. Reserve program straight out of S.A.I.S. and spent that summer at
                    Parris Island, South Carolina. Three months of Marine boot camp had the desired
                    effect, showing me a new and different view of the world. Parris Island was
                    followed by three months obasic infantry school at Camp Lejeune, North Carolina.
                    By December 1963, I could hardly wait to get back to school. I was married on
                    December 28, and my wife and I moved to Morningside Heights, New York City.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were a regular Marine then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: I was a member of the Marine Reserves. But the Reserve program began with
                    the six months active duty training which all Marines received, both Reserves
                    and Regulars together. No distinction at all was made between us during this
                    training period. Following these six months in active service, June to December,
                    1963, I joined the Marine Reserve unit nearest to Columbia University, where I
                    went for my Ph.D. I met my unit, a communications battalion, for a weekend a
                    month at the Brooklyn Navy Yard, and spent two weeks in summer training with the
                    Reserves in each of the two years I was at Columbia. The first summer we took
                    amphibious training at Little Creek near Norfolk. The next year we were given
                    communications training at the Marine base in San Diego. That was in 1965, at
                    the moment President Johnson took the fateful decision not to send the Marine
                    Reserves to Vietnam. We were all packed and ready to go straight to Vietnam from
                    San Diego. Fortunately, we were spared that experience.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know why you didn't go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: I think it was because of the heavy losses that Army reserve units had
                    suffered when they were deployed to join the Korean conflict fifteen years
                    before. The President reckoned that the political costs of large casualties at
                    the time in Vietnam would be unacceptable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were never a long term Marine?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: That's correct. The Marines I saw then as a needed breaa sort of recess
                    period between my M.A. and Ph.D programs. My two years at S.A.I.S. had given me
                    a broad exposure to Africa and “a view of the U.S. in a changing world
                    environment,” as one of our courses was titled. But the program was not designed
                    to prepare students for teaching, with the depth and concentration one would
                    need to teach well. I realize I had a double desire at the time: to teach and
                    also to practice in the most helpful way, not necessarily in that sequence. I
                    decided to take my degree in political science, a degree which I thought was
                    more in keeping with my practical bent than one in history. Columbia offered a
                    program which would permit me to continue with my interest in Africa and which
                    also would give me credit for the work I had done at S.A.I.S. This meant that I
                    would have to do only three more semesters of classwork before studying for my
                    comprehensive oral exam. In addition, Columbia's political science prograwas
                    historically oriented, in contrast to the more quantitative-based, statistical
                    approach to politics elsewhere — at Yale and Berkeley, for example.</p>
                <p>I majored in comparative government (Britain, France, and “Africa”), with a minor
                    in political theory. L. Gray Cowan was the chieAfricanist in the department and
                    became my supervisor. For the two languages which the Ph.D. required, I
                    qualified in French with no further study required, and in Swahili. Because
                    Swahili is one of Africa's most widely spoken languages, it qualified me to
                    apply for a National Defense Foreign Language (NDFL) scholarship. I began
                    Swahili with an intensive course offered at Pittsburgh's Duquesne University in
                    the summer of 1964, and I continued to study Swahili at Columbia for another
                    year after that. The NDFL paid my college tuition, and the language was very
                    useful to me in my field research a few years later.</p>
                <p>In addition to these courses at Columbia, I also took a seminar next door at
                    Teachers College on education and politics in Africa, taught jointly by Cowan
                    and David Scanlon. The interaction of politics and education had interested me
                    ever since my thesis work at Princeton. It was a theme I brought with me to AID
                    and one which, in a very broad sense, I suppose, defined my career in foreign
                    assistance.Joins USAID in Tanzania as Education Program Office1966-1968</p>

                    further the politics of education. But before that there were the course
                    requirements to complete and an oral exam to pass. All this occupied my time
                    between January 1964, just after leaving Marine active service, and the Spring
                    of 1966. Then, on a particularly memorable Friday in Marcpassed the orals, we
                    packed up our VW Beetle, drove to Washington, and I joined AID on the following
                    Monday.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">You completed your doctorate after you joined AID.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Yes — some time after. After a year or so at Columbia I was completely
                    satisfied that I was not primarily suited for an academic career. But I wanted
                    very much to complete my degree, because teaching was a strong secondary
                    interest of mine and one I expected to pursue later on. In these circumstances,
                    it seemed best to write a dissertation on a contemporary subject based on first
                    hand field research. I knew very well that this route was bound to take longer
                    than if I were do all my research in libraries in close touch with my
                    dissertation committee. Field research was also a good deal riskier. Whichever
                    route one took, I knew that only about half of Ph.D. candidates in those days
                    ever finished their dissertations and got their degrees.</p>
                <p>In the mid-Sixties, Tanzania seemed the most exciting African country to study.
                    Remember the appeal of Nyerere's Arusha Declaration, with those who were calling
                    him Africa's philosopher king? My problem was how best to get there and do my
                    research, at a time when grants to do this sort of thing were still hard to come
                    by. By good fortune, there was a visiting professor at Teachers College at this
                    time, John Cameron. He had served prominently in the British Colonial Service in
                    Tanganyika in charge of education up until Independence a few years years
                    before. Cameron was admired by his African colleagues and still maintained
                    contact with a number of them. When I explained my problem to him, he wrote on
                    my behalf to Augustine Mwingira, the Director of Planning in the Ministry of
                    Education. Mwingira turned the letter over to the AID Education Advisor at the
                    time, “Windy” Niblow. Bremarkable coincidence, AID had been trying for nine
                    months to recruit someone qualified to work in the Education Ministry as a
                    direct-hire program officer, someone who could help Niblow to build up AID's
                    education assistance program.</p>
                <p>This was just the opportunity I was looking for. The position would pay my way.
                    At the same time it would give me the chance to learn about the education system
                    from the inside. The Mission Director, Sam Butterfield, interviewed me when he
                    came to Washington. On the strength othat and the quality of my application
                    letter, which he noted approvingly, he asked AID/W to sign me up. I made it
                    clear from the start that at the end of two years I would request a leave of
                    absence to write up my dissertation. Sam approved. In this way, inconceivably
                    simple by today's standards, I went directly from graduate school to AID as a
                    direct hire Foreign Service officer.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REA: I was to spend half my time at a desk provided for me by the Ministry's
                    Department of Planning and the other half at a desk in USAID/Tanzania, as part
                    of the program office. Although I had had some formal orientation before leaving
                    Washington, the first thing I had to do when we reached Dar es Salaam was to
                    figure out how the Mission worked. To help with this, the Executive Officer,
                    John Garney, left a full shelf of manual orders on my desk to greet me on my
                    first day at the office. I hardly had room to sit down. Garney said he expected
                    I would have them read by the end of the week. I didn't realize he was
                    joking!</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You hadn't had much orientation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: AID/W had given me a general orientation from mid-March to mid-April, but we
                    didn't much cover Mission operations. When my wife and I got to Tanzania after
                    an all-night flight from Paris, Windy Niblow was there at the airport to meet
                    us. It was 2:00 pm on a sweltering day, a Saturday. The first thing Windy did
                    was to hand me a softball mitt and his first words were: “Welcome to
                    USAID/Tanzania. The game starts at three; you're playing center field.” We went
                    from the airport to the hotel, I dropped my bags, and I was in center field by
                    3:00 pm.</p>
                <p>That was my introduction to a very close and high-spirited mission. We worked
                    very well with the Embassy, the Peace Corps, and private sector individuals of
                    all types. Sam Butterfield, as I said, was Director, John Hummon was his chief
                    Program Officer, and Dave Shear the Deputy Program Officer. Each year while John
                    and Dave were there, the USAID had put on the “Country Capers,” a musical satire
                    aimed at everybody, the Ambassador included. I arrived just as Dave and John
                    were leaving. But under Sam Butterfield, a model Director, I learned a lot about
                    AID policy and operations in general, about the education sector in particular,
                    and, as part of the program office, a great deal about how projects of many
                    different kinds should work. Education then was the prime emphasis of the
                    Mission. I don't have a record of our total mission budget, but I do know that
                    USAID/T obligated $2 million a year on the education program alone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>REA: First, I'll say what we were not doing. In those days, AID stayed clear of
                    direct involvement in primary education. I only discovered the reason for this a
                    few years later, in 1972, when John Hannah visited us in Botswana. He had just
                    left his post as the Administrator of AID and was traveling for the Rockefeller
                    Foundation. Hannah told me that primary education was considered too sensitive
                    politically in the post-Independence era for the U.S. to be directly influencing
                    policy or content for primary schools. Instead, when I joined AID in 1966, the
                    educators put prime emphasis on “human capital formation” and “training
                    trainers”. For us in Tanzania, this meant mostly constructing and equipping
                    colleges at the post-secondary level to prepare Tanzanians for careerin
                    agriculture, engineering, and teaching.</p>
                <p>As a junior program officer for a major sector — education — I think I had the
                    ideal “first job” in AID. It permitted me to get involved at first hand with all
                    the basic AID operations at the time. These included such activities as
                    procurement for equipping the technical college we had built on Zanzibar. Here,
                    by the way, we came to know Tom Pickering, who was the U.S. Consul there at the
                    time, before he became the Deputy Chief of Mission at the Embassy in Dar. Tom
                    learned Swahili so well that he was able to give the memorial oration for Dr.
                    Martin Luther King at the Anglican Church in Dar largely in that language, to an
                    overflow congregation of Tanzanians. Today Tom is the Under Secretary of State
                    for Political Affairs, our leading career diplomat. I have been unusually
                    fortunate in the high caliber oState Department officers with whom I have
                    served.</p>
                <p>But to get back to what we were doing in Dar. Another one of our projects stocked
                    the library at the University College of Dar es Salaam. Also, got involved in
                    loan negotiations, for building a teacher training college at Iringa, in the
                    center of the country. I helped in the planning ocapital projects, especially
                    phase III of the University College construction. A big part of my job was
                    managing contracts. At one point we had 49 contract Americans in the country. I
                    dealt directly with the Chiefs of Party of big teams from several U.S.
                    universities. West Virginia State was helping to create the national agriculture
                    college at Morogoro, west of Dar es Salaam. A team from Cal Poly, San Luis
                    Obispo was helping to establish a technical college in Dar itself. Teachers
                    College Columbia was running a very large regional project for East Africa, from
                    thproject headquarters at Makerere College in Kampala, Uganda. That project had
                    begun its second phase, training the trainers of primary school teachers. Not
                    only was I just involved in all these operations, but the Mission gave me a
                    great deal of responsibility, as well. For example, I served as acting Education
                    Officer for five months shortly after I arrived, between the time that Niblo
                    left and Noel Myers arrived to replace him. Dr. Myers also delegated a great
                    deal to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there for three years?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>REA: Yes, we were in Tanzania for just over three years. In July 1968 I left the
                    Mission, followed by a third year in-country gathering data for my dissertation.
                    But in this regard things did not work out exactly as planned. The Government of
                    Tanzania had soured a bit on the U.S. by then on account of Vietnam and a number
                    of other events. The GOT did not want someone who was officially connected to
                    our government roaming around Tanzania doing research. I'm quite certain that if
                    I hadn't developed a relation of trust with my colleagues in the Ministry of
                    Education, where I worked for a part of every day for over two years, the GOT
                    would have denied me permission to do research of any kind.</p>
                <p>As it was, we arrived at a compromise. I had to resign entirely from AID before
                    the Tanzanian government would give me permission to stay, which I did as a
                    Research Fellow at the University College, unpaid, of course. Most of this third
                    year my wife and I spent in four separate education districts in various parts
                    of the country: in an area south of Lake Victoria around Nzega; at Mwanza, a
                    town on the shore of Lake Victoria; in Moshi, at the foot of Mt. Kilimanjaro;
                    and in a very poor area, Handeni, north of Dar es Salaam. I had selected these
                    four districts, with the cooperation of the Ministry of Education, to be
                    representative of the different ways in which the government of Tanzania
                    financed and controlled primary education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find reasonable cooperation in getting all the
                        information?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Yes, especially at the district level. Once the central authorities had
                    approved my topic and selection of districts, the District Education Officers
                    cooperated fully. Initially, however, I ran into a big problem. The Tanzanian
                    government refused me permission to pursue my original topic, the one which my
                    thesis committee at Columbia had approved before I left in 1966. I quite naively
                    had proposed to study “the politics of education planning” at the national
                    level. Tanzania in 1968 was drawing up the new five year plan in education. As
                    an aspiring political scientist, I thought that the study of this process would
                    provide an important insight into how politics worked in a newly independent
                    African country. It was a project, of course, which no country in the world at
                    that stage (or probably any stage) would have permitted a student to
                    undertakmuch less an American in the late 1960's under the shadow of the Vietnam
                    war.</p>
                <p>So I was obliged to come up with another topic which would get me out of Dar es
                    Salaam to do research. As it turned out when I was all finished, my associates
                    in the Ministry of Education were quite interested in the tabular profile I
                    provided of all the rural and urban education districts in the country, showing
                    the discrepancies between them. These findings were also sensitive, and, to
                    reiterate what I have said before, it was a measure of the trust which my
                    Ministry colleagues, especially Augustine Mwingira, who had moved up to become
                    Permanent Secretary, decided to give me that I was allowed to do what I did at
                    all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you care to summarize what you found out, what you
                        learned from that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>REA: I'll try. In a broad sense, my topic was the nature of the political
                    relationships which existed between Tanzania's central and local governments in
                    the post-Independence period, 1962-1969. My particular viewpoint was the issue
                    of primary education, which became perhaps the most important bone of contention
                    between the central government and the local authorities.</p>
                <p>Central government began by trying to control the growth of primary education in
                    order to allocate as much money as possible to expand the post-primary education
                    sector. The government's aim was to train Tanzanian replacements for expatriate
                    personnel and so to reduce dependence on the former colonial power as quickly as
                    possible. The way that the central authorities thought the expansion of primary
                    education could be contained was to require the local districts themselves to
                    pay for teachers and other school expenses as much as they could.</p>
                <p>This strategy did not work for long. District councils faced a rapidly growing
                    demand for primary schools, which soon became their leading financial concern.
                    Primary school costs grew until they swamped the council budgets. Teachers, a
                    key political group, were not getting paid and some councils were going
                    bankrupt, or at best had insufficient funds for activities related more directly
                    to income and development. Another political problem was that the richer
                    councils could afford school systems which the poorer councils could not. Before
                    long, the inequities became too great for the “nation builders” in the capital
                    to accept.</p>
                <p>What also became clear to President Nyerere and his party, TANU, was that they
                    were missing a big opportunity: the reform of primary schools would be a
                    necessary element in the “revolution” of the rural sector. They came to see
                    primary education as a vital part in the creation of attitudes supporting
                    long-term government programs. Evidence of this is Nyerere's famous tract,
                    “Education for Self-Reliance,” which he wrote in 1967. This was also the time of
                    his interest in Mao's experience in reaching China's rural masses. It coincided
                    with Tanzania's growing ties with Mainland China, as evidenced by China's
                    building of the Tan-Zam railway. This new perspective on primary education,
                    combined with the virtual breakdown of many district governments, all led to
                    central government's virtual takeover of the primary school system in 1969.</p>
                <p>What I took away from all this was an acute appreciation oprimary education as a
                    hot political issue and not just a major administrative and budgetary concern in
                    the growth of a new nation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then you left there in 1969, is that it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>REA: Yes. My wife and I left Tanzania in the summer of 1969, traveling by way of
                    the Far East, and we arrived home on the weekend that Armstrong landed on the
                    moon. Unfortunately, men on the moon was not all that was new. I also came back
                    to find that Columbia University had been deeply shaken by Mark Rudd's
                    Vietnam-era student riots the year before. Naturally, the politics department
                    had been a special target of the strikers. Symbolically, the Department of
                    “Public Law and Government” had changed its name to “Political Science.”</p>
                <p>But far more important for me, all the faculty members who had made up my thesis
                    committee had either left the University or were on their way out. The new
                    committee did not accept the draft I submitted in January, 1970. Their judgement
                    was that it was too much concerned with education and not enough with politics.
                    One member of the committee facetiously suggested that I cross the street and
                    get my Ph.D from Teachers College! Of course, for me this was out of the
                    question. I had not trained for a degree in education, and at that point
                    certainly had no desire to do so. My only recourse was to start all over,
                    completely from scratch, reconfiguring the data I had gathered in the field to
                    rewrite the thesis to the new specifications of the new committee under a new
                    supervisor.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get all the data for that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Fortunately, I had all the data I needed. It just took a bit of ingenuity,
                    and a lot of time, to organize it in another way. But the final topic I ended up
                    with, as I've just described, was not nearly as interesting as my original topic
                    on the politics of education planning. That, I suppose, was my main
                    disappointment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and of more current interest now, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Now, as well as then! During the time I was researching and writing the
                    thesis, I had, you'll recall, resigned from AID. I had no obligation to return
                    to AID, and the Agency had no obligation to take me back. This left me in a
                    particularly good position to consider all my options for what I wanted to do
                    next. Of course, I did go back to AID. But it's interesting that I never
                    thought, until probably the late 1980s, of spending my entire career with AID. I
                    had imagined doing good things with AID but then going on and building on this
                    experience in other ways, especially in teaching. So every time I was up for
                    reassignment, every three or four years over the next two decades, I would ask
                    myself what I really wanted to do next. As it turned out each time, the thing I
                    decided I wanted to do most was the thing AID gave me the opportunity to do.
                    Looking back now, I see a remarkable congruence of interestmy own and the
                    Agency'which lasted up until the very end, with one exception in 1988, which
                    we'll get to. And even that turned out well.</p>

                <p>Returns to USAID/W and the AID/State Nigeria progra1970-1971</p>
                <p>REA: By January 1970, when the new committee turned down my thesis, we had been
                    living off savings for a year and a half. With our first child on the way, I
                    needed to get back to work even as I rewrote my dissertation. At that time, for
                    an Africanist with a political science background and a penchant for development
                    work, one challenge stood out in bold letters: Nigerian reconstruction.
                    Nigeria's two and a half year civil war ended that month. I learned that a joint
                    State/AID desk, on the model used then for our Latin American operations, was
                    being set up to manage our post-war program for Nigeria. As it happened, AID was
                    recruiting for a GS assistant desk officer who had had some economics training.
                    While I am no economist, I was able to point to seven semester courses of
                    economics which I had taken at Princeton and S.A.I.S., and this was enough to
                    satisfy the requirement. So AID reinducted me as an “International Relations
                    Officer” stationed in Washington to help with Nigerian post-war
                    reconstruction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did that involve?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: That involved a lot of worry about how I was going to do my job and still
                    get my thesis written! From the time I came back to AID in the summer of 1970
                    until the time Columbia University finally accepted my thesis, about a year
                    later, my preoccupation was not first with Nigeria, I'll readily confess. My
                    obsession was getting this all-important academic requirement out of the way. I
                    was commuting in from Columbia, Maryland, about three hours round trip each
                    day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall what was going on about Nigeria at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Well, I had primary responsibility on the Desk for backstopping education
                    and manpower projects. We put together teams to review the post-war situation
                    and to give us recommendations on how AID could be most helpful. Wolfgang
                    Stolper, founder and head oMichigan's Center for Research on Economic
                    Development (CRED), then famous for his book Planning Without Facts, led one of
                    these teams. AID had invested heavily after Independence in 1960 in
                    buildinpost-secondary education infrastructure, together with large technical
                    assistance teamMichigan State's effort at Nsukka University in Eastern Nigeria
                    was perhaps the outstanding example. But after the civil war we had to
                    fundamentally reassess all these programs. We needed a new approach and a new
                    policy.</p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>My role, of course, was definitely at the grunt level, working on PROP reviews
                    and contractor selection panels, monitoring allotments, writing OYB and
                    Congressional statements — that sort of thing. In fact, I felt with the thesis
                    hanging over me that the less visibility I had, the better. For my first six
                    months I worked under Don Miller who, despite his drill instructor mannerisms,
                    was very understanding about my thesis requirement. Don allowed me to cobble
                    together long weekends from official holidays and from my annual leave
                    allotment, enough to give me the patches of continuous time I needed to
                    reorganize my data and to write the new draft. Miller saw a long-term advantage
                    to the Agency in my getting the degree, and he offered me gruff encouragement,
                    for which I'll be eternally grateful.</p>

                <p>Undertakes the formation of USAID/Botswan1971-1974</p>
                <p>REA: On December 5, 1971, two days after I had submitted the approved draft of my
                    dissertation to Columbia University, my wife and I with our 16 month old son,
                    Bayard, and our Brittany spaniel climbed on the plane for Botswana. I was
                    assigned to be AID's first resident officer in the capital, Gaborone. Charles
                    (Carlos) Nelson had recruited me just after he had been named the first U.S.
                    ambassador to the BLS countries (Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland) earlier that
                    year. He and I had first met after he succeeded Sam Butterfield as our Director
                    in Tanzania, during the year I was gathering information for my dissertation.
                    Ambassador Nelson had decided to make the Embassy in Gaborone his resident post,
                    while traveling to Lesotho and Swaziland on a regular basis. Concurrent with
                    that and at his request, our Office of Southern Africa Regional Affairs
                    Coordination (OSARAC) established an Assistant Program Officer position in
                    Gaborone. This is the position I was to hold for almost two and a half years,
                    before we left at the end of March, 1974 to return home for family reasons.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>REA: The short answer is that I was expected to organize the AID program in
                    Botswana. This meant establishing the resident AID presence there. The Embassy
                    gave us two rooms on the top (third) floor and we employed Dorothy Dambe, who
                    became the vivacious mainstay of the office, as my Assistant. We began to pull
                    together the threads of the regional projects which pertained to Botswana. We
                    created a day-to-day working relationship with the host government (GOB) and
                    donor agencies, and we began to plan future activities. It was a very exciting
                    opportunity for me, but it entailed a certain risk. The risk was that I was
                    working with an Ambassador who was a career AID officer with very determined
                    views, while at the same time working for the Program Officer at OSARAC, located
                    in Mbabane, over 400 miles away! Fortunately, for the most part, we all made a
                    go of it, thanks to Ambassador Nelson's sound professional judgement and to the
                    skills of Roy Stacy (to whom I reported, later George Eaton) and especially of
                    Charley Ward, the Director of OSARAC, who had the Ambassador's full confidence.
                    There was a lot to do.</p>
                <p>Botswana had won Independence only five years before. The country, which is
                    almost the size of Texas, had a population then of perhaps 750,000, little
                    infrastructure and very few trained people. By the time I got there, two
                    sizeable AID capital projects were already underway. The first was a $6.4
                    million loan for a water pipeline. The pipeline formed part of an intricate
                    multi-donor package in support of the $300 million Shashe copper-nickle mining
                    development in the Francistown area, in the northeast. Our understanding with
                    the government was that with the increased export earnings from the mine,
                    Botswana would invest in building roads and expanding health and education
                    programs, which were also minimal.</p>
                <p>The second capital project which had started by the time I arrived was the
                    construction of a 230 mile gravel surfaced road to the northwest of Francistown,
                    financed with a $16.6 million loan. The road was designed to link the
                    Francistown spur with the Botswana-Rhodesia border on the Zambezi River in the
                    extreme north.</p>
                <p>Later we engaged in planning to construct a small abattoir in the north-central
                    region. The abattoir was under study as part of a strategy to improve cattle
                    management and off-take, so as to improve returns to small producers. Finally on
                    the capital side, we made grants to the Gaborone campus of the University of
                    Botswana, Lesotho, and Swaziland (UBLS), which later broke up into three
                    national institutions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the campus became the University of Botswana.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>REA: Yes, perhaps by 1980. As they had done with the University of East Africa
                    and its three campuses at Dar es Salaam, Makerere, and Nairobi, the British had
                    invested a great deal of effort in establishing a regional institution, with
                    three national branches, for Southern Africa, as well. This approach made a lot
                    of sense but ultimately it could not stand up to nationalist pressures, nor even
                    to regional pressures, as we saw later in the case of Nigeria. Each country
                    wanted its own university. But regardless of how UBLS was configured, our main
                    interest was in helping the institution change the kind of education it
                    provided. We strongly favored a shift away from the classical “Oxbridge”
                    tradition to one consistent with employment demands, along the lines of the U.S.
                    community college model. In the 1969-72 period we provided the Botswana branch
                    of UBLS with a six person team from Cal Poly. We continued to supply faculty
                    under an OPEX arrangement for a time after that. With the teachers we included a
                    small grant program for the construction on the Gaborone campus of offices and
                    housing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you able to complete those projects? Let's take the

                </p>
                <p>REA: In part the road was needed to connect the northern part of the country with
                    the rest. The north was an area which at the time could only be reached by
                    Landrover over cross country trails. This was the primary motivation, and one
                    that had become more urgent as the refugee population increased along the
                    Rhodesia border in the course of the nationalist struggle for independence
                    throughout the 1970's. The line of the road, from Nata to Kazungula, was
                    intended to run parallel to the border and thus could also provide access to
                    that refugee population. Left unspoken was Botswana's security interest in
                    defending against potential incursions by Rhodesian forces at any point along
                    that border.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REA: Formally, yes, after 1969 when the Lusaka Manifesto was adopted. The
                    movement developed, no doubt, in talks between Presidents Seretse Khama of
                    Botswana, Kenneth Kaunda of Zambia, and Nyerere. When Mugabe came to power in
                    the new country of Zimbabwe in 1980, then the front-line concept took more
                    institutional form in the founding of SADCC, the Southern African Development
                    Co-ordination Conference, which we supported very actively.</p>

                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>REA: Yes, from almost every direction. Security was only one aspect of Botswana's
                    general concern about the sorry state of the nationainfrastructure. The roads
                    were almost all dirt roads, including the roads into Gaborone, the capital. The
                    Kasane area in the far north, as I've said, was entirely cut off from the rest
                    of the country. So as a way of unifying the country, and for the other reasons I
                    have mentioned, the Nata-Kazungula road was a key project. It received a great
                    deal of attention from the REDSO/EA engineers and from the East Africa Loan
                    Office. We enjoyed a stream of visitors from Nairobi.</p>

                    had already begun for a Phase II, to harden the surface.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REA: Although we carried out a feasibility study in 1972, I'm not sure the
                    satellite abattoir ever got built. The abattoir was under review as one way we
                    might assist small cattle producers in the north-central area, between
                    Francistown in the east and Maun on the edge of the Okavango in the west. These
                    small producers were disadvantaged by the fact that Botswana's only abattoir at
                    the time was located in Lobatse in the southeastern corner of the country. Their
                    cattle had to be trekked in to Lobatse over hundreds of miles, and naturally the
                    animals lost much of their weight and value. Experience in our own country had
                    demonstrated that it was more efficient for us to locate an abattoir in
                    proximity to the cattle than it was for us to transport the cattle long
                    distances to a central hub for slaughter.</p>
                <p>Because cattle production in central Botswana was the work of small-holders, the
                    idea for this project grew in part out of the equity concern for “the poorest of
                    the poor” which had begun to take hold in the early Seventies. But beef was also
                    one of Botswana's leading exports, and the European market was becoming more
                    accessible. The hooker in all this, and one objection which may have doomed the
                    project after I left, was that cattle raised on the central plain were
                    susceptible to infections spread by wild animals. The disease risk was of
                    special concern to the Europeans, as it continues to be — witness the “mad cow”
                    episode a few years ago.</p>
                <p>But planning for the abattoir was only part of a larger concern we had for
                    agriculture and range management as a whole. We saw a definite shift in the
                    period I was there from capital projects to technical assistance. The TA was
                    designed to address Botswana's severe shortage of trained people. We recognized
                    that here was the heart of the dependancy probleleaving aside Botswana's
                    situation as a land-locked state. Only political change in South Africa,
                    Rhodesia, anSouth West Africa could help to remedy that, and this process was to
                    take another 15-20 years.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REA: The technical assistance portion of the program grew quickly. We contracted
                    some individuals individually to fill established positions, under an OPEX
                    arrangement. We were helped in deciding where to place our people by the Ford
                    Foundation representative in Botswana, Frank Glynn. An Englishman, Glynn worked
                    in the President's Office as director of the GOB's manpower plan. This was the
                    very same function Frank had played in Tanzania, where he and I had known each
                    other well just a few years before. Our OPEX program placed experts, as part of
                    our agriculture/range management strategy, in such key positions as the Deputy
                    PermSec (Technical) for Agriculture, in posts in the Planning and Training
                    division of that Ministry, and in a lecturer position at the Botswana
                    Agriculture College, then a secondary level institution. As I was leaving
                    Botswana in 1974, a five person team arrived to plan a project which would
                    provide six additional persons for range and livestock management purposes,
                    along with the short and long term training of Botswana to replace them.
                    Training was a staple of all our technical assistance projects.</p>
                <p>The previous year we had introduced staff in two new areas, as well. One team of
                    four, recruited by our Internal Revenue Service, helped the government to frame
                    and implement the new income tax law, while training replacements. The IRS team
                    was very effective, and was partly responsible for the fact that tax revenues
                    doubled in the time the team was there. The second new area was health. We
                    brought in three public health nurses, a health educator, and an administrator.
                    This team gave a big boost to Botswana's Maternal Child Health (MCH) program.
                    The team was also instrumental in starting an organized approach to family
                    planning in Botswana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find working with the Botswana?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Very productive. Gaborone was a small, comparatively simple place in the
                    early Seventies. Sir Seretse Khama as President set the tone of integrity and
                    clear thinking. His Vice President who later succeeded him, Quett Masire,
                    doubled as Minister of Finance and was similarly direct and informal. I remember
                    his arriving one evening for a reception at our house, driving his own pick-up
                    truck. Masire's Director of Planning, Festus Mogai, who is today President, was
                    my chief contact person in the government. I met with him regularly. These were
                    exceptional men, smart and dedicated, with their feet on the ground.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>But because there were relatively few trained Botswana on the job at the time,
                    the government had to place great reliance on expatriates. The fact was that
                    Botswana attracted some of the very best, just as Tanzania had done in the
                    Sixties; in fact, some were the very same people. The PermSec in Finance, with
                    whom we met frequently, was South African born Quill Hermans, a highly
                    intelligent and capable economist. Later, in the 1980s, Quill took leave to work
                    at the World Bank before returning to Botswana where he is a citizen. Pierre
                    (Peter) Landell-Mills and Mike Stevens, both British, both had worked in
                    Tanzania, both served under Mogai in the Planning Office, and both went on to
                    careers at the World Bank.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REA: Indeed, yes. The Botswana, from Seretse Khama down, had a clear and
                    reasonable plan for exploiting their mineral and other assets, caring for their
                    people, and achieving the greatest measure of independence possible from their
                    neighbors, South Africa and Rhodesia. And the expatriate staff served them very
                    well. Their plan was a plan which AID could buy into and their needs matched
                    some of our comparative strengths. For me it was an outstanding time for
                    learning about development broadly and about how AID could best respond. In
                    addition to this, the general environment there on the edge of the Kalahari
                    prepared me well for what turned out, very inadvertently, to be the next chapter
                    of my AID career.</p>

                <p>REA: For family reasons, as I mentioned, it was time to go home. After returning
                    from Tanzania in 1969, my wife and I had met Jim Rouse, the founding father of
                    Columbia, Md., and we had bought a town house there in 1970. While we were in
                    Botswana, Rouse had been struck with another inspiratiothe Dag Hammarskjold
                    College. It was located in Columbia and was designed to offer a world-oriented
                    curriculum to a student body consisting 50% of students from abroad. The College
                    was just getting underway in 1974. The president of the college asked me to join
                    the faculty to teach and to help develop their curriculum.</p>
                <p>I found the offer very appealing, especially as it would allow me more time close
                    to my family, which had now grown by the birth of our second son, Ben, in
                    Southern Africa. Fortunately, George Eaton, who had replaced Roy Stacy, and
                    Charley Ward both had urged me to apply to AID for a leave of absence, which
                    AID/W granted. I say fortunately, because in my first month there the College
                    went bankrupt, and I was able to return to AID without any delay. Sam
                    Butterfield was on assignment in Washington at the time. He offered to keep me
                    busy until the Africa Bureau could find me a regular assignment.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>This happened almost immediately. David Shear had just been called back from
                    Abidjan, where he had set up and directed REDSO/WA. His new assignment was to
                    create and manage AID's response to the multi-year drought which had ravaged the
                    huge region of West Africa on the southern border of the Sahara Desert. Dave
                    urgently needed another pair of hands. When he learned that I was available, he
                    asked me to join him on the strength of our brief working relationship in Dar es
                    Salaam. This entire turn of events was entirely fortuitous and unplanned, but
                    for me it was momentous. I began work with Dave in June, 1974, on a venture
                    which was to consume the next 10 years of my life — from three different vantage
                    points: from AID/W in the 1974-78 period; at our Embassy in Paris for sixteen
                    months, 1978-80; and then as a member of USAID/ Senegal, again under Dave's

                <p>REA: Generally speaking, I had two functions during these years in the Sahel
                    Office. For the first two years I reported to Dave's Deputy, Irv Coker, to shape
                    the field studies and the overall plan which culminated in our Report to the
                    Congress of April, 1976. This report was the basis for the legislation which
                    created the Sahel Development Program, or SDP, with its own line item
                    appropriation in the years that followed. From April 1976 until I left for my
                    next assignment in September 1978, I reported directly to Dave Shear. From that
                    point on, I was charged with formulating and overseeing our human resources
                    development (HRD) strategy for the Sahel. HRD was a part of the comprehensive,
                    multi-donor approach which Dave and others conceivefor helping the Sahel area
                    over time to become self-sufficient in food.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the strategy. What was the strategy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Our goal, as I've just said, was food self-sufficiency in the Sahel — the
                    eight-countrregion which reachefrom the Cape Verde Islands in the west to Chad
                    in the east, a band about 3000 miles in length with about 27 million population.
                    Tens of thousands had died in the 1969-1973 Sahel drought. At that time it was
                    known as one of the great natural disasters of the twentieth century. Memory of
                    the multi-donor relief program, 1972-1973, was very fresh at the time I started
                    work with Dave a year later. The emergency had cost the donors a total of a
                    billion dollars, of which the U.S. had contributed a quarter. We had even used
                    the Air Force to deliver food to remote areas of Mali and Chad. And the threat
                    was always hanging over us that the drought could return any year. So we felt we
                    had to work fast.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>By the time I joined the program we were in the middle of the 1973-1974
                    post-emergency, or relief and rehabilitation, phase. Up until the emergency AID
                    had only two offices in the region, at Dakar and Niamey. To handle all the
                    increased activity, we were now setting up small offices in each of the six
                    countries where we had had no representative. We allocated $2-3 million to each
                    of the eight offices for quick-disbursing, short term activities. Also in that
                    year, 1974, we designed and began work on medium-term projects. These were
                    directed at improving agriculture and health, and we created one or two such
                    projects per country for most of the eight. I think nearly all of the
                    agriculture projects we mounted then were designed to help national parastatal
                    agencies get more seed and fertilizers to the farmers. These inputs seemed to be
                    the most pressing need over the so-called medium term, threefive year
                    period.</p>
                <p>At the same time as all of this was happening, in the Fall of 1974, we fielded
                    three teams to the region, each covering two or three countries, for the purpose
                    of exploring the potential for development and to recommend longer term
                    projects. The findings of these teams were written up and presented in a total
                    of 1100 pages, the so-called “Development Assistance Program (DAP)-substitutes”.
                    The DAP conclusions, together with the main findings omajor diagnostic studies
                    funded by AID and other donors, formed the basis of our Sahel Development
                    proposal. This proposal is what we sent to the Congress, over Secretary
                    Kissinger's signature, in April 1976. It was the document upon which our long
                    term program was to rest.</p>
                <p>We qualified “food self-sufficiency,” our goal, in some important ways. These
                    affected how our strategy was designed. We stated up front that this was a
                    long-term goal, 20-30 years in the future, and we insisted that no quick fixes
                    were in order. On the contrary, we were clear that only a transformation
                    oproduction systems would do the job. Also, we saw food self-sufficiency not as
                    a country-by-country goal but as a regional one, encouraging trade between
                    Sahelian countries and the coastal countries to the south. We further envisioned
                    food self-sufficiency as necessarily entailing environmental stability. Fuelwood
                    and reforestation became important concerns. Finally, we believed that food
                    self-sufficiency could be durable only if it were achieved in the context of
                    self-sustaining economic growth.</p>
                <p>Conceived in this way, our strategy showed in a matrix form that the factors
                    making for food self-sufficiency were all related to one another. We used this
                    grid, or matrix, as a simple illustration owhat we intended to be a
                    comprehensive approach to the problems of the region.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the components?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>REA: The matrix, as you would imagine, consisted of a series of vertical columns
                    intersected by horizontal columns. The vertical columns represented the main
                    sectors of food production: dry-land agriculture, irrigated agriculture,
                    livestock, and fisheries, although fisheries did not receive much attention. The
                    horizontal columns represented categories of actions which were essential to the
                    improvement of food production across all sectors, actions such as HRD and
                    health, ecology and forestry, and transportation.</p>
                <p>We added horizontal columns for at least two special concerns which first
                    surfaced in 1977 as a result otwo major, ground breaking studies which we
                    funded. The first of these had to do with “cereals policy,” as it became known.
                    Elliot Berg, who had by then replaced Wolfgang Stolper as the Director of
                    Michigan's Center for Research on Economic Development (CRED), directed a review
                    of the most important policies with a bearing on food production in the Sahel.
                    Price policy was foremost, but policies related to land tenure, storage, and
                    food donations like our PL 480 program were also significant. Singly and taken
                    together, these policies as devised at the time in all the Sahel countries, Berg
                    showed, amounted to a huge disincentive to farmers. It became apparent to all
                    sides over about two years that unless the Sahel governments adjusted these
                    policies, our common goal of food self-sufficiency would be forever out of
                    reach. Despite the political sensitivity of these policies, the Club/CILSS
                    (which I'll get to in a minute) organized a series of meetings to address the
                    policies issue directly. These meetings helped our country Missions to a
                    significant extent in their talks with each of the Sahel governments. The other
                    special concern which became important to all of our production programs, and
                    which was therefore also represented in the matrix by a horizontal column, was
                    recurrent costs. Like the policy issue, the recurrent cost consideration was as
                    novel for donors in the mid-Seventies as it is boilerplate and standard today.
                    This issue came to the fore soon after the drought had ended, when the Sahelian
                    countries presented the donors with a list of projects estimated to cost,
                    according to one account, around $3 billion total. The donors were ready to fund
                    the majority of these projects plus others which the donors had identified
                    themselves. But the donors made the proviso that the host governments must agree
                    to assume the recurrent costs of the donor-funded projects after a stipulated
                    number of years, say, five to ten. We feareand this was one of Dave's biggest
                    worriethat without careful planning and restraint at the outset, the Sahelian
                    governments would sink under the weight of the recurrent expenses of all these
                    projects when the 5-10 year period was up.</p>
                <p>The matrix, then, represented the mix of disciplines which the Sahelians and
                    donors proposed to use to put the region on a firm footing.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>By 1976, wthe donors and the Sahelianwere loosely organized at three levels to
                    work towards food self-sufficiency. The Sahelians were engaged through an
                    organization known as thCILSS, a French acronym for the Permanent Inter-State
                    Committee for Drought Control in the Sahel. The Sahelian states formed the CILSS
                    in September 1973 to speak with a common voice vis-a-vis the donor community for
                    the help which the Sahelians urgently needed. On the donor side, at our urging
                    in partnership with the French, the OECD in Paris agreed to shelter a small,
                    unofficial office which became known as the Club du Sahel. The Club was
                    inaugurated in March 1976 to work with the CILSS in coordinating donor efforts.
                    The Club also served as a forum for joint study and dialogue between donors and
                    Sahelians. As the Club insisted, this arrangement was no luxurit was
                    indispensable, in facfor work in an area which we outsiders needed to understand
                    very much better than we did in the mid-Seventies.</p>
                <p>The Club/CILSS represented the top level of organization. Below that, there were
                    series olarge committees belonging to a Working Group of donors and Sahelians.
                    There was one such committee for each of the vertical and horizontal sectors
                    shown on the matrix. I represented AID on the HRD committee. Our job, typical of
                    the others in their respective disciplines, was to recommend a strategy, or
                    approach, to breaking the education and training bottlenecks which we all
                    determined had to be eliminated if food self-sufficiency was to be achieved.</p>
                <p>The third and final level of organization was at the country level where, of
                    course, most of the action took place after our Missions were set up and
                    staffed, in the second half of the Seventies.</p>
                <p>The entire complex of actions undertaken between 1974-197including the staffing
                    of new field offices, the organizing of the Club/CILSS superstructure, the
                    planning for Congreswas orchestrated on our side by Dave Shear and Don Brown,
                    the Deputy Assistant Administrator for Africa. They worked under the gun of the
                    Secretary of State and ultimately of the White House, to establish a program
                    designed to avert another costly humanitarian emergency in the Sahel. The
                    Congress, strongly influenced by the Black Caucus which had asked for a plan in
                    the first place, bought the plan and supported it. For all of us who worked to
                    set up the Sahel Development Program, the experience was as exhilarating as it
                    was exhausting. It is represented in my mind by the lively planning sessions
                    which we held at Dave's hospital bedside each time his back went out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This strategy was quite region wide, it wasn't country
                        focused?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>REA: Yes, the SDP was regionally oriented, especially in the beginning. In fact,
                    the title of the strategy which we sent to the Congress in April 1976 was “A
                    Proposal for a Long-Term Comprehensive Development Program in the Sahel.” We
                    were seeking, and achieved, a line-item appropriation for the Sahel as a whole.
                    This was to protect funding for the many years we knew it would take to make the
                    fundamental changes necessary to achieve the goal. We saw the 1969-73 disaster
                    as a Sahel-wide failure; therefore, we believed the remedy needed to be
                    region-wide, as well. In our view, the countries shared more similarities than
                    differences, and we wanted to encourage joint approaches to common problems.
                    This is the main reason that we resisted requests by other countries adjoining
                    but not part of the region, like Guinea and the Cameroun, for inclusion in the
                    program.</p>
                <p>In one major way, we could see the wisdom of this regional approach even at the
                    outset. As I've said, the Club/CILSS organized many fora to bring Sahel and
                    donor reps together to discuss problems which were common to each of the
                    countries in the region. We found that it helped a great deal to discuss
                    sensitive issues such as cereals policies as a general problem first, because
                    this established a certain commonality and reduced the defensiveness of the
                    individual governments when we would approach them at the country level later
                    on. Straight dialogue at the country level came much more naturally after the
                    subject had been discussed regionally.</p>
                <p>Of course, the regional strategy began to accommodate the country strategies
                    which we developed by the early 1980's, as our country missions got staffed up.
                    I was part of this myself when I joined our Senegal office in 1980. But our
                    effort in the mid-seventies was to create a model which would bring donors and
                    Sahelians together in a systematic way to deal on a long-term basis with the
                    common problems of the region. After that, we were better set to plan for
                    country-specific issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This model, can you elaborate on it a little more? How did
                        you convert it into a program? You had a framework with certain sectors
                        selected and certain issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Yes. This question begins to get at the 1976-78 period in my story. After
                    the Congress approved the general concept of the SDP by mid-1976, we began the
                    detailed planning for programs which could bring about the fundamental changes
                    in production systems and supporting activitielike education and traininwhich we
                    knew would be necessary for the Sahel to become food self-sufficient.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>In the first two years I had been operating for the most part under my program
                    officer hat. I had been very much involved in the DAP exercise: designing
                    instructions for the three DAP teams before they went out, rewriting and editing
                    their reports into a final summary version, and boiling this down into the
                    Congressional Overview presentation and the Special Report to Congress, and so
                    forth. But I had also participated in my human resources function on two of the
                    DAP teams. One of these, led by Princeton Lyman, went to Senegal, Mauritania,
                    and Mali in September-October, 1974. John Pielemeier led another DAP team to
                    Chad a few months later. For both reports I wrote the analysis and project
                    recommendations for the human resources sector.</p>
                <p>So the shift to becoming the HRD person on the Sahel Development Program Team
                    (SDPT) was a very natural one. Dave constituted the team in May 1976, with the
                    express intention that the SDPT mirror the composition of the Club/CILSS Working
                    Group. He named one individual on the team for each of the elements of the
                    matrix. All of our members were not located in AID/W, and each of us had other
                    assignments besides the time we spent with our respective committees of the
                    Working Group. For example, our team member who represented AID on the livestock
                    team was Howard Helman. He was located in the Economic Section of our Embassy in
                    Paris. Roy Stacy had also moved to Paris, to the OECD, where he served as Deputy
                    to the remarkable Director of the Club Secretariat, Anne de Lattre, a French
                    citizen. Anne and Roy started the Club du Sahel which, as I've said, was
                    formally launched at Daker in March, 1976. The Club and CILSS in conjunction
                    supported the Working Group and all its sector teams, including the HRD team, or
                    committee.</p>
                <p>I had other tasks, as well, during this period. For example, I wrote the original
                    AID grants to the Club and to the CILSS, the grant to Michigan State to
                    establish a Sahel Documentation Center, and many other things of this sort which
                    were “program” work. But my main job in these two years, from mid-1976 until I
                    left the Office in mid-1978, was to develop AID policy in the HRD sector for the
                    Sahel and to begin the design of projects to put the policy into effect. This
                    entailed a great deal of coordinatiowith the donor/Sahelian HRD team, with our
                    own Missions which were beginning to grow in all eight countries, and with our
                    own U.S. community of academicians and consultants who had special expertise and
                    interest in the area. I should add, we defined HRD broadly. While education and
                    training were at the heart of it, we also included communication and information
                    networks, as well as activities related to public participation in development,
                    such as the study of migratiopatterns.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>The matrix model was meant to be suggestive of the main factors we needed to take
                    account of in planning our programs and projects. This is how it was meant to
                    work, at all levels. But as our Missions grew up, of which the one in Dakar was
                    the first and largest, some of them perceived the matrix and the SDPT as a
                    central planning body with the potential, at least, of interfering with their
                    own ideas of what should and should not be done in their countries. For example,
                    our Director in Senegal, Norm Schoonover, a very experienced man and totally
                    fluent in French, was especially sensitive to this. He believed we did not give
                    enough credence to his judgement of how to handle the country program for which
                    he was primarily responsible. He may have been right. The matrix framework may
                    have driven, instead of just guided, what we recommended.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Too top down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Sometimes too heavy, yes. The comprehensive character of the model was
                    compelling. But in the effort to cover all the bases in planning our programs we
                    may not have prioritized accurately enough what we could and should achieve. We
                    may not have listened closely enough to what our people stationed in the
                    Missions were beginning to tell us. But I think this was an inevitable part of
                    the transition from a program which had to originate in Washington, since in the
                    beginning there were no Missions, to a program where the Missions, once they
                    were up and running, had to call the shots. It was not a problem of the model,
                    per se, in my view, but of the process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How much of the model was based on an understanding of the
                        situation in the area?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: By mid-1976, as I've suggested, we had gone through a succession of
                    overlapping phases, each designed to do different things: the response to the
                    emergency, the actions belonging to relief and rehabilitation, the design of
                    medium-term projects. We hear talk today of th“disaster-to-development
                    continuum” here was a text book model! And concurrent with the last two of these
                    phases, the donors and Sahelians had begun to study the area for long-term
                    solutions. Not only on the U.S. side, but the French and multi-laterals were
                    turning out studies which we in our busy office hardly had time to keep up
                    witeven if we had had the French capability to do so. Our DAP studies which I've
                    mentioned were designed to capture all this information and analysis, whilmost
                    importantlgiving us an on-the-ground view by our own people. Most of the
                    first-hand knowledge which went into the Sahel Development Program as authorized
                    by the Congress came from the three DAP missions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do on those missions? How did you get some
                        sense of what was required?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>REA: These teams prefigured the Club/CILSS Working Group to the extent that we
                    included a specialist on each DAP team for each of the sectors of the
                    matriagriculture, livestock, HRD, etc. The big difference, of course, was that
                    the DAP teams were almost entirely American, each led by the best person Dave
                    and Don Brown could find in AID. The first team, as I mentioned, was led by
                    Princeton Lyman. At that time Princeton was Chief of the Project Design Office
                    in the Africa Bureau. He later went on to a great career, serving as our
                    Ambassador to Nigeria, then to South Africa, and ultimately as Assistant
                    Secretary of State for International Organization Affairs. But in the Fall of
                    1974 our assignment was to visit and report on the potential for development in
                    Senegal, Mauritania, and Mali, and to make recommendations for what AID should
                    do in our respective sectors over the next five years, and more generally in the
                    longer term.</p>
                <p>Lyman's DAP team numbered about twelve, as I recall. We set out in September
                    1974, passing through Paris for a briefing by the Cooperation Ministry, before
                    arriving in Dakar. In each of the three countries we began by meeting with the
                    AID/Embassy people and with the host government. Then we would all fan out to
                    follow our own leads in our respective fields of interest. I had not spoken
                    French outside of the classroom since my experience with Operation Crossroads in
                    Senegal and Mali in 1961. Even so, I probably spoke French more fluently than
                    most of my colleagues. Each of us talked with whomever we could, mostly host
                    government officials but also with Peace Corps volunteers and the
                    representatives of private voluntary organizations. We visited potential project
                    sites. Although we were limited to about a week in each country, we nonetheless
                    brought back first-hand impressions which helped us interpret critically the
                    documents we collected on the ground and received later on.</p>
                <p>From all of this, our main task was to describe the dimensions of the problems
                    and recommend what we should do to tackle them in the medium and long term.
                    Obviously, this exercise was intended to be a first crack, not the last word,
                    but even so, the decisions taken on the basis of our recommendations often had
                    long-lasting effects. In my area, human resources, for example, the Government
                    of Senegal asked us to support the reform of the formal school system. My
                    recommendation was that we should not do so until the GOS had demonstrated that
                    they really meant business. This is a judgement that has held up until now, some
                    twenty years later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>REA: This is a good example of the importance of the field visits which our DAP
                    teams performed. Anything we could have read in Washington would have told us
                    that Senegal's school system was in terrible condition. Illiteracy was on the
                    order of 85-90%, despite the fact that the government was allocating over a
                    quarter of the annual recurrent budget to education. About 60% of that went for
                    primary schools. Money wasn't the prime problem. But it was abundantly clear
                    from what we saw when we visited Senegal that the education system was dominated
                    by the French heritage and that there was little will among the ruling elite to
                    change matters. The French cultural ascendancy was symbolized by the literary
                    eminence of then-President Senghor. Higovernment was French educated. Even 14
                    years after Independence, in 1974, French was still the language of instruction
                    in every primary school throughout the country.</p>
                <p>True, the GOS saw that change had to happen. In 1971 the GOS had even passed an
                    “Education Orientation Act” to say as much. Nyerere's “Education for
                    Self-Reliance” had an effect on thinking even in Senegal, across the continent
                    and the language barrier. But my clear sense when I went back there was that the
                    political will was not yet behind education reform in Senegal as it had been in
                    Tanzania. Senegal's formal education system was not yet ripe for fundamental
                    change. And even if the GOS had been committed, education reform there would
                    have constituted a huge task over many yeara job for which AID would not have
                    had as strong a voice as other donors such as the French themselves and the
                    World Bank. Unless we were all speaking with one voice, it would not have
                    worked.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REA: We were very apprehensive that the rains could fail again any season. Food
                    production was emerging as our principal focus. So I preferred a pragmatic
                    approach. In our report I recommended that AID should help establish an
                    effective and efficient rural education system, one which would include elements
                    of non-formal training institutions, post-secondary professional schools, and ag
                    extension organizations. Rather than doing this country wide, at least in the
                    beginning, I recommended that we should help improve these elements and step up
                    what they could do for farmers and their families in the geographic areas where
                    we were already supporting agriculture programs, such as the mid-term production

                <p>For example, in Senegal we were committed to helping SODEVA, the parastatal
                    agency responsible for agriculture in the Peanut Basin. I recommended that we
                    work in that area through the government non-formal education agency, Promotion
                    Humaine, to deliver literacy and skills training to farmers and their families.
                    This training would be designed to enhance their ability to absorb new methods
                    and, at the same time, to take greater responsibility for improving village
                    life. I further recommended that we support the work of ENEA, the government
                    school for training rural planners and administrators. For the longer term, I
                    proposed that we carefully monitor the effectiveness of this training in order
                    to help formulate an eventual program to improve rural education more generally
                    in Senegal. This approach, it seemed to me, would make for a more coherent
                    assistance package and would lead us by stages into a solid long-term
                    program.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REA: Essentially, our HRD strategy for the Sahel as a whole was an extension of
                    the approach we adopted for Senegal. If Senegal, the most advanced of the former
                    French colonies in Sub-Saharan Africa, was in this much difficulty with
                    education, you can imagine the state of affairs in the rest of the Sahel.</p>
                <p>In December, 1976, the HRD team which had been formed under Club/CILSS auspices
                    met for the first time, in Ouagadougou. As for all the other sector teams, our
                    Chair was a Sahelian and the members were a mix of donors and Sahelians. More
                    than anything, this team became an information gathering engine and soon we were
                    swamped with lists, requests for aid, and the like. The team process did not
                    open up any very clear avenue of approach. But the information we collected
                    certainly confirmed the dire state of affairs of education/training institutions
                    and systems in the region. The systems were expensive, their coverage was
                    inadequate, and their orientation was skewed and inappropriate. Worst of all was
                    the condition of the primary school systems. More than half of Sahelian students
                    dropped out before attaining basic literacy, and perhaps only a quarter of the
                    age group even entered school at all.</p>
                <p>In preparation for the December 1976 Ouaga meeting, we at AID had reviewed the
                    education/training systems in each of the eight countries. We also had reviewed
                    all the parts of our agriculture, health, and other programs in which we had
                    committed funding for HRD activities, such as participant training. I asked Norm
                    Rifkin to join me at the Ouaga meeting from his post as HRD officer with
                    REDSO/WA in Abidjan. Norm had just joined AID and became my most valued human
                    resources partner, both then and later. He was a professional educator, which I
                    was not, and he spoke French more fluently. Together we listened to the lists of
                    requests from the Sahelians and we heard the project ideas from other donors,
                    all mixed up in a mind-boggling brew out of which some sort of strategy, or
                    sense of priorities, would have to be distilled.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Directly on the heels of the Ouaga meeting I had my first crack at drafting the
                    HRD strategy for our Sahel program as a whole. This came in the form of the
                    human resources section of our Congressional Presentation for FY 1978. The
                    statement I wrote was supposed to reflect the best judgement of our field
                    missions, the SDP team, other branches of AID/W, and the best lights of our
                    growing collection of outside experts. In the few paragraphs allotted, the
                    “strategy” conceded that the human resources requirements of the region were so
                    daunting that education and training could be justified at every level and in
                    all sectors of our program. But as food production was our chief objective, the
                    HRD strategy came down most heavily on skills training to improve the yields of
                    the agriculture sector and to improve the life of the rural poor. We made
                    special mention of the needs of women, who, among other roles, were the chief
                    farm producers in the Sahel.</p>
                <p>The main emphasis of the HRD strategy was on training at middle levels to ease
                    the transfer of new technologies. These applied both to farm and off-farm
                    populations, in agriculture production but also in health, nutrition, and
                    cooperative management. The strategy recognized functional literacy as a
                    constant need throughout. At higher levels, the strategy prescribed training and
                    retraining in such skills as planning, evaluation, and finance for the general
                    management orural programs. The HRD strategy said less about livestock and
                    fisheries than it did about irrigated agriculture and dry-land production, which
                    were a more important concern for the SDP plan overall. The higher level
                    training part of the strategy bore fruit later on in several ways, most notably
                    in the design and approval of the Sahel Manpower Development Project (SMDP)
                    which I worked on for four months towards the end of my AID/W assignment. The
                    SMDP was tprovide long and short-term professional training, to be given in the
                    Sahel and outside, for many hundreds of Sahelians. SMDP training was additional
                    to the participant training which we provided under all our regular projects. In
                    1983 alone, after the SMDP hit its stride, the project funded 300 students.The
                    connection between the kind of thinking which had guided our DAP recommendations
                    in 1975 and the HRD strategy two years later is pretty obvious. In March 1977,
                    Dave sent me to join the small committee of the Sahel HRD team which had been
                    tasked with developing the overall HRD strategy for the Club/CILSS. We worked
                    for two weeks at offices at UNESCO in Paris, with the notable help of Dr. Eugene
                    Staley, a well-known authority on human resource planning, whom we provided.
                    Essentially, the group adopted the skills approach taken in our Congressional
                    Presentation, expanded it, and presented it to the total HRD team which met in
                    Dakar at the end oMarch 1977. There the strategy was accepted. I doubt that the
                    HRD strategy had much influence in and of itself. The importance of the
                    exercise, I think, lay much more in the general familiarization we members
                    gained with each other, Sahelians and donors. Norm Rifkin joined me again at the
                    Dakar meeting and we continued to work closely, until Norm came to replace me in
                    AID/W when I left for my next assignment in September, 1978.</p>

                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>REA: That's a big question. There were a great many. Most important, I think, was
                    the construction of the Club/CILSS framework because it set the tone of more
                    frank and positive talk between all parties, donors and Sahelians, on the whole
                    range of issues and activities before us. This spirit, and the long-range vision
                    we shared, encouraged substantial funding from a wide range of sources on a
                    sustained basis, much beyond what we would have ordinarily expected. This
                    context for our work stimulated the creation of new programs and institutions
                    and brought existing ones back to life. These included the River Basin
                    Commissions for the Senegal and Niger, Agrymet for regional weather forecasting,
                    the Famine Early Warning System (FEWS), a renewed and refurbished pest and
                    locust control program, the integrated pest management program for on-farm,
                    non-pesticide control, new approaches to forestry like agro-forestry and village
                    wood-lots, new approaches to village hydraulicon and on.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about some of the other agriculture projects?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Our thinking in agriculturwhich, after all, was the heart of the
                    prograevolved quite a bit as we learned more about the Sahel region. The
                    mid-term projects which we launched in 1974-75, as I said, aimed at
                    strengthening the parastatal agriculture organizations which most countries had
                    in place. They were charged, along with many other things, with getting seed and
                    fertilizer out to the farmers. In the beginning we felt delivering inputs would
                    be the surest approach to raising production in the short term But it didn't
                    take the agronomists long to see that the extension packages themselves needed a
                    lot of improvement. After that, while continuing our support to extension, we
                    turned more of our attention to the research systems.</p>
                <p>We did this through two channels concurrently. One channel was direct support for
                    the international crop research agencies, especially ICRISAT, which developed
                    improved dry-land varieties of grains like millet and sorghum. These new
                    varieties then needed to be adapted to local conditions. And so our second
                    channel was support for the national research organizations in each of the
                    Sahelian countries. Here, it became clear that the national research centers had
                    to carry out more on-farm research if they were to ensure that farmers used in
                    an optimal way the improved seeds, fertilizer, and techniques which were the
                    result of the research. Also, of course, the on-farm research tended to improve
                    the relevancy of the work in the national research centers.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>At about the same time we realized that the way in which the extension systems
                    were organizethe parastatals themselvewere an inefficient way of servicing the
                    farmers. Our experience elsewhere indicated that the private sector might
                    support farmers at much less cost to the governments than the parastatals were
                    doing, and faster and better, as well. Elliot Berg's work on cereals policy was
                    another important conceptual innovation, as I mentioned. His insight into this
                    general problem in the Sahel, by the way, became the heart of the World Bank's
                    famous and (at the time it appeared in 1981) controversial Report on Sub-Saharan
                    Africa as a whole. Berg left CRED to direct this seminal study, for which he was
                    primarily responsible.</p>
                <p>Perhaps we could also use the word “innovation” to describe the big integrated
                    development programs which we designed in the five largest countries of the
                    region. They resembled the integrated nature of the SDP in general and were open
                    to the same criticism — that in trying to be comprehensive, they were too
                    complicated. I think we all agreed later, after a few years experience with
                    them, that simpler was better, given AID's rigid rules abouproject design and
                    implementation, rules which made it impossible to easily change and adapt our
                    projects to unforeseen circumstances. Simpler was better, too, for the host
                    countries, which did not yet have the trained management to handle these big
                    projects. BuI'm getting ahead of ourselves into the critique of the program, and
                    that's not what you asked.</p>
                <p>While talking about agriculture, we should also say something about livestock.
                    Here we had some successes, notably in the improvement of watering points and in
                    animal health. We spun a great many wheels, however, in the attempt to improve
                    the transport and marketing of Sahelian animals into the coastal states. As I
                    suspect was the case in Botswana, our efforts in the livestock sector probably
                    did not pay off substantially.</p>
                <p>In the area of forestry, we introduced a natural forest management approach which
                    worked well in some places. One big problem we facein developing new-growth
                    woodlots and forests was finding a good, fast growing species for Sahelian
                    conditions. In parallel with our efforts to increase the amount of fuelwood
                    commonly available, we tried out various sources of alternative energy. These
                    ranged from a sophisticated, high-tech solar energy installation in Bakel in far
                    eastern Senegal, which proved to be uneconomic and overly complicated, to very
                    low-tech models of heat efficient cooking stoves, which made much more sense,
                    and other ideas in between. None of these met with rip-roaring success, at least
                    not in the first ten years of the program.</p>
                <p>But the fuelwood/energy question was a crucial part of the food problem in the
                    Sahel, since the most available foods — millet, rice, sorghum — were inedible
                    unless they were cooked. Almost all of the fuel used for cooking was firewood,
                    and since the population was growing, it was easy to see that the region would
                    turn into an even hungrier place unless our energy/forestry efforts and our
                    agronomic work went hand in hand.</p>

                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: We might begin with the large program to eradicate river blindness, or
                    onchocerciasis, in Upper Volta, now Burkina Faso. We took this on with the World
                    Bank and a consortium of other donors. The River Blindness program became a very
                    successful regional disease control operation. In addition, anticipating the
                    construction of the large dams at Manantali and Saint Louis, AID was the leading
                    donor in studying the likely effects on health which large-scale irrigation
                    projects would have in the Senegal River basin.</p>
                <p>But our most important contribution in health was our effort to get the Sahel
                    countries to do more about primary health care and rural public health services.
                    Typically, most of the health budgets went to keeping up the central hospitals
                    in the capital cities. Much more needed to be done to bring health care to the
                    rural majorities. The outstanding figure in introducing this new approach was
                    Dr. Mike White, who served as the Club/CILSS health advisor in Ouagadougou,
                    1978-1980. Mike then joined our Mission in Senegal, a few months after I got
                    there in 1980. Connected with primary health care was the introduction oMCH/FP —
                    family planning — which we saw as indispensable if the region was to become food
                    self-sufficient over the long term. Mike understood, however, that a traditional
                    society, perhaps especially a Muslim society as found in the Sahel, would not
                    even consider family planning unless primary health care was assured beforehand.
                    Mike saw that family planning and health care services could work best and most
                    naturally if offered in the same facilities.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REA: Professionally, after the country-specific work I had done in Tanzania and
                    Botswana, the Sahel program was a mountain-top experience. The Club/CILSS
                    comprehensive vision o“development” brought together all the various elements
                    which we must deal witthe various sectors, the technologies, the policies, the
                    donors and recipientand integrated them into one long-term, regional program
                    with a common goal (food self sufficiency) and a common, phased strategy: short,
                    medium, long-term.The SDP experience trained me, and I think all of us who
                    worked with it closely, to think comprehensively, to see the inter-connections
                    between most of the things we do as an Agency, and to take account of all the
                    connections we ought to make as a donor/recipient community. I think the SDP
                    experience taught us to relate to our host government colleagues as our
                    superiors in the knowledge of their region, because our ignorance, while
                    understandable, was profound. I know we learned a spirit of humility, but I fear
                    we did not learn as fast as we should have. Much of what we thought would work,
                    in practice did not.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>For me, one of the big question marks in all of this was the role of the French.
                    France, of course, had been the dominant outside influence in the region for a
                    hundred years. How much did France support the Club/CILSS approach in reality? I
                    asked myself this in spite of the work of one of the most impressive development
                    professionals I have met, Anne de Lattre, the founder and Director of the Club
                    du Sahel and a chief architect of the SDP approach, along with Dave Shear and
                    others. Anyone interested in this whole approach, by the way, should read the
                    100 page booklet Anne prepared with Art Fell, who replaced Roy Stacy at the
                    Club. It's entitled “The Club du Sahel: An Experiment in International
                    Co-operation” anit came out under OECD auspices in 1984. The booklet is a
                    concise, candid review of the Sahel program overall and the lessons we took away
                    from that experience.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the French specifically, did you find them cooperative
                        in the field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Personally, found the French cooperative, but they did not always follow
                    through in the way I expected they would. I enjoyed being with their technical
                    people, since they knew the region firsthand. Many were people who had spent
                    their whole professional lives working in those areas. How willing they were to
                    think and act in some of the new ways I've mentioned is really my question. As I
                    found out in my next post, France's Africa policy generally is something of a
                    mystery even for informed French people: who designs it, how does it actually
                    work? But I was also going to say in connection with the Club du Sahel that the
                    World Bank's non- participatiowas a big gap.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know why?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: I have no first hand knowledge of that, but I think the Bank in those days
                    really preferred to deal on a country by country basis rather than with a region
                    as a whole. I think they felt responsibility to their Board of Directors at that
                    time to be in control of whatever programs they undertook, rather than doing
                    what they could do to help a joint communal effort. The Bank may have shied away
                    from the predictions we were making when we set 2000 AD as a target for food
                    self-sufficiency. It also may have been that Anne de Lattre simply did not want
                    the World Bank to come into this common effort unless they were willing to come
                    in as equal partners, with no inordinate compulsion to insist on their way of
                    doing things.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other aspects of this first four years? We
                        can go on with the Sahel from another perspective.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Lots of other perspectives! Your interviews in this oral history series with
                    Dave Shear, Art Fell, and Roy Stacy, just to name the three most knowledgeable,
                    are “must” reading for folks who want other points of view.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>But I can't leave the SDwithout commenting on three other aspects. One I want to
                    underscore was the outside attention the program attracted. This came from first
                    class individuals like Elliot Berg antwo of the scholars who worked on the
                    recurrent cost problem, William Beazer of the University of Virginia and Clive
                    Gray at Harvard. Interest also came from world class institutions, like the
                    Rockefeller Foundation, the National Academy of Sciences, NOAA, and M.I.T. We
                    never hesitated to go after the best talent we could find, and the drama of the
                    droughmoved people and organizations to seek us out, join in and help. AID had a
                    great deal to learn about the region, and we got the best help around.</p>
                <p>A second noteworthy point: with a clear eye to learning about the region, Dave
                    contracted with Michigan State to establish a section of the MSU library as a
                    repository for all the information we would be collecting on the Sahel,
                    including all the reports by other donors and institutions which could be
                    obtained. Once the MSU center got going, we provided funds to the Sahel
                    Institute in Bamako, founded in December 1977, to create a documentation center
                    of its own, with help from MSU. We also set up a documentary center in our own
                    AID/W office as a working collection. When Dave and I got to Dakar together in
                    1980, we did the same thing in our Mission. That center is still very much alive
                    todaan excellent resource, according to a colleague who just returned from
                    Senegal. Documentation, I think, must be part of any well-devised long-term
                    program. These days, of course, documentation may be much more easily organized
                    electronically, without taking up physical shelf space, and much more easily
                    accessed.</p>
                <p>One last comment: I was worried at the time about the difficulty we were having
                    in locating French-speaking officers to staff our missions and teams in the
                    region. Still harder was it to find anyone with Sahel experience. I proposed
                    that we set up a fund which would provide partial scholarships to Peace Corps
                    volunteers who had a good track record in the Sahel, who wanted to return to
                    grad studies in areas consistent with our needs, and who would be willing to
                    join our program on completion of their studies. Though Dave supported the idea,
                    we failed to get AID approval. But Carl Eicher, head of MSU's agriculture
                    economics department, had the same thought. We made an initial grant to MSU to
                    get the program started. MSU in this way produced some outstanding graduates,
                    several of whom worked with us during the time we were in Dakar.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know any individual that went through that

                </p>
                <p>REA: Chris Delgado, who was a Peace Corps volunteer in Chad when I first met him,
                    was one. Chris is now a senior staff member of IFPRI, the International Food
                    Policy Research Institute here in Washington. I think Tom Zalla, who worked with
                    us in Senegal, was another. Marty Makinnen, who helped our program in
                    Madagascar, was a third, I believe. Carl Eicher would know all of them. His
                    graduates worked all across the region and were prized for their experience and
                    training and their French-speaking abilities in the Sahel and elsewhere, later
                    on.</p>

                <p>Acts as USAID Liaison Officer, U.S. Embassy/Pari1978-1980</p>
                <p>REA: Marvelously, without my lobbying for the job at all, I was assigned to the
                    one single post which AID held at the time at our Embassy in Paris. The post was
                    located in the General Economic Policy section and was established there in 1974
                    to assure a measure of coordination with the French on our assistance programs
                    to Sub-Saharan Africa. My predecessor was Howard Helman, who, as I mentioned,
                    had been conducting our business very vigorously with the Club/CILSS livestock
                    team. When I got to the Embassy in September, 1978, my State Department
                    supervisor, Bob Duncan, took me aside and made clear that the Ambassador, Arthur
                    Hartman, had agreed to continue the AID position I was about to fill on the
                    express condition that the next incumbent, namely me, should not serve as a
                    livestock specialist!</p>
                <p>Rather, as the Embassy's “overseas development coordinator,” my job, Duncan
                    emphasized, was to analyze and report on the full gamut of issues connected with
                    French economic assistance. Duncan introduced me to the individual down the hall
                    who represented the U.S. Treasury in the EmbassBob Gelbard, who is today serving
                    as the President Clinton's Representative to Bosnianencouraged us to work
                    towards a comprehensive understanding of the structure of French assistance.
                    Although Gelbard had many other things to do, that became my mission, and I'm
                    pleased that I have something to show for it after the 16 months I was
                    there.</p>
                <p>Although I wathe sole AID officer in the Embassy, we did have other officers in
                    Parione at UNESCO and several at the OECD, which now sheltered the Club du
                    Sahel. At the same time as I arrived in town, Art Fell came to replace Roy Stacy
                    as Deputy to Anne de Lattre. In the first few months Art (who was bilingual in
                    French) and I teamed up to make a series of day-long visits to several of the
                    most important component agencies of the French assistance program. Later, I
                    made many more visits on my own. After the end of my tour in Paris, I put
                    together all I had learned about the French aid program to Tropical Africa in a
                    33 page airgram. It was a labor of love which I finally completed in Dakar in
                    July 1980. Bob Duncan in the Paris Embassy cleared my airgram and sent it out to
                    a wide number of posts, including all our Africa Missions. Embassy/Paris also
                    distributed my message to our embassies in the four other capitals (London,
                    Bonn, Brussels, and Ottawa) which along with Washington had agreed to join in
                    the “Giscard Initiative.” This was an idea of the French president to encourage
                    joint project funding in Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>The airgram represented, I think, and Bob Duncan would agree, the most complete
                    report we had up to that time on French assistance overall. I had had to start
                    from scratch because we knew so little. This report was the main thing I had to
                    show as evidence of my 16 months in Paris, since the representational nature of
                    the job didn't encourage visible results. Norm Schoonover, our Director in
                    Dakar, came up to replace me and I left Paris to become the Program Officer in
                    USAID/Senegal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What can you recall about what you wrote about how French
                        cooperation worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: The first thing that struck me was the size and complexity of the French
                    program. In volume of assistance to Sub-Saharan Africa, France was the Number
                    One bilateral donor — $1.5 billion of ODA in the year I was writing, 1980. I
                    wrote the airgram as a guide for development people like myself who had been
                    asked to work with the French more closely, but who found they knew next to
                    nothing about the purpose and instruments, with all the acronyms, of the French
                    aid program: who did what, and why, and how much — that sort of thing.</p>
                <p>There were two other interesting characteristics of the program. First, its
                    centerpiece was technical assistance. France had 11,600 “cooperants” in Tropical
                    Africa at the time. About three-quarters of them were teachers. According to
                    OECD, France was, not surprisingly, the leading bilateral donor in aid to
                    education, accounting for over half of all education aid by the DAC countries
                    combined. Most of these “cooperant” teachers were posted in secondary schools or
                    secondary-level institutions. Along with the cooperant program went a very large
                    French investment in training, on the level of well over 5,000 scholarships and
                    training grants each year, for courses both in France and Africa, of both long
                    and short term duration.</p>
                <p>The second characteristic which interested me about French aid was its emphasis
                    on research. About two-thirds of all the research assistance given by the EEC in
                    these years was French. And the agencies which carried out this research were
                    quite specialized and were state-supported. My airgram went into the broad lines
                    of policy, but in it I also catalogued the various institutions which made up
                    thFrench program, perhaps in more detail than many busy AID officers in the
                    field wanted to read. I intended the airgram to be a reference document. I
                    imagine it may still have some currency today as it describes the basic agencies
                    and institutions of French aid, although I'm sure the program has gone through
                    many changes over the past 15 years.</p>

                        is not too much.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That is very important history.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Yes, given the sheer size of the French program, if for no other reason. Of
                    course, French aid was concentrated pretty much on the former French colonies,
                    and most particularly on five countries: Senegal, Ivory Coast, Cameroon, Gabon,
                    and Madagascar. Also, the nature of the program was quite different from ours.
                    In the way it was organized, under the watchful eye of the Presidency (the
                    Elys�e), France's aid program was a model of close articulation between foreign
                    policy, trade policy, economic assistance, and internal economic policy, all set
                    within the workings of the franc zone. Still, French assistance had a very human
                    face and this was the cooperant, mostly teachers, as I've said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the cooperants also just people, staffing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Yes, the other quarter of the 11,600 cooperants then serving in Sub-Saharan
                    Africa were the so-called “technicians.” About 1500 of these were in health
                    services, and the balance, some 2000, were in miscellaneous fields like
                    administration, utilities, agriculture, and industry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In positions in government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Yes, very often. Perhaps the ones we most think of in this regard were those
                    in administration. They were often very influentialegal, economic, and cultural
                    counselors in presidential and ministerial offices, magistrates, internal
                    security and military advisors, and communications people. No wonder it was said
                    that the French technical assistance program represented the “transmission belt”
                    of French policy in Africa. But that's a bit of an overstatement, since they
                    were concentrated in the five countries I've mentioned. Also, compared with
                    1960, the proportions were reversed. Twenty years before, at the time of
                    Independence, the “technicians” were three-quarters of the total number of
                    cooperants and held positions in the government, and only one quarter in 1960
                    were teachers. So the French program had changed with the times.</p>

                <p>REA: My four years helping the Sahel Program to get up and running had been very
                    intense. Sadly, my wife and I separated towards the end of that period. The
                    Paris assignment was just what I needed to regain a larger perspective and take
                    a few deep breaths. Our Paris Embassy was second to Bonn at that time as the
                    largest U.S. embassy anywhere in the world. All the U.S. agencies were
                    represented, and we were proud to be led by a distinguished career diplomat,
                    Arthur Hartman, who wenfroParis to become our ambassador to the Soviet Union. I
                    found a ground floor apartment on the Seine across from the Eiffel Tower and I
                    could walk to work every morning. Life was so good in that sort of way that
                    within only a few months I realized I would be lost to development if I did not
                    get out at the first good opportunity. I did not have long to wait.</p>

                        study, so to speak?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: You bet! In fact, the study took the least official time — it was the
                    product of late nights and weekends — even though reporting was supposed to be
                    the main result of all I did. As the AID man in the Embassy, I spent a great
                    deal of time, as you can imagine, supporting visitors, briefing them, setting up
                    meetings and accompanying them. Fortunately, I had a crackerjack secretary,
                    Jacquie L'Huillier, who had worked for years in the Embassy and performed the
                    routine jobs with great zest. She was known to all our regular visitors. I also
                    got involved in several projects, such as a remote sensing center in
                    Ouagadougou, and in various activities, like supplying Rwanda during a war with
                    Uganda. But I did not have any responsibility for these activities other than
                    “coordinating,” and I soon discovered that that kind of work, without any
                    responsibility for programs, is profoundly unsatisfying in the long run. The
                    good thing was that by means of all these meetings I got to see the French
                    system in action, and this provided much of the insighI needed to write my final
                    report, the airgram.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REA: No, Art Fell was managing all of our interests at the Club. I always needed
                    to know what the Club was doing to factor that into the larger picture
                    oFranco-American coordination. Both France and the U.S. were members of the
                    Club. But from my position I was interested in what the French themselves were
                    doing, not only in the Sahel but in other places in Africa, as well, in order to
                    orient others to the total French program. Still, the Sahel region was where the
                    U.S. and France were doing the most together. I came to believe that in an age
                    of shrinking budgets for personnel, if I were running AID, the position I
                    occupied in the Embassy would be hard to justify. It made me feel uneasy to be
                    in that kind of slot.</p>

                <p>REA: Yes, the “Giscard Initiative” which I've mentioned was the most important.
                    It had a formal title, something like CADA, Concerted Action for Development in
                    Africa. I was involved in the first two rounds of talks which involved senior
                    people from AID/W and the other capitals. The meetings took place, as I recall,
                    in the building which had served as the secret meeting place for U.S.
                    negotiations with the North Vietnamese five or six years before. It was a grand
                    old building on a tree-lined avenue in the area of the Arc de Triomphe. But I
                    don't know what became of the CADA initiative, since I left Paris just at the
                    time it began to gather some steam. The fact that Norm Schoonover, our most
                    experienced French-speaking Mission Director, replaced me at the Embassy was
                    taken by the French as a sign, I think, that the U.S. was taking Giscard's idea
                    seriously. You were involved in one or both of these initial meetings. Whatever
                    became of CADA?</p>

                <p>REA: Seven or eight months after I got to Paris in September 1978, Dave Shear was
                    named the next USAID Director in Senegal. He was to begin there in November,
                    1979. Sometime in late Spring 1980 Dave asked me to consider joining him in
                    Dakar as his Program Officer. Even by then I had already decided that I needed
                    to get back to the field, and I jumped at the chance. Professionally, I was
                    eager to apply some of the concepts we had developed under the Sahel Development
                    Program. I also considered Senegal as my African home, ever since my experience
                    there in 1961 and several visits back during my work with the SDP. Most of all,
                    Dave and I worked together in a very creative way, and I knew no one with his
                    degree of energy and vision.</p>

                <p>REI arrived in Dakar on January 10, 1980 to replace Gene Chiavarolli, one of the
                    Africa Bureau's most outstanding field officers, then and later. Although Gene
                    had moved on, I had been fortunate to travel to Dakar from Paris for a few days
                    the previous October to talk with him, so we had some face-to-face
                    continuity.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the situation in Senegal at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: For a number of reasons, the U.S. looked on Senegal then as a key African
                    ally. This had to do principally, I think, with Prime Minister — later, after
                    1981, President — Abdou Diouf's influence in the U.N. and with the relatively
                    democratic way in which he managed the government. But we all recognized that
                    Senegal was in rough shape economically. The country required both short and
                    long term assistance, far more than we could provide alone on a bilateral
                    basis.</p>
                <p>Senegal was the Sahel in microcosm, except that it had direct access to the sea.
                    In the short-term, Senegal's balance of payments was in dangerous imbalance. As
                    I recall, the debt service payments as a percentage of export earnings had grown
                    from 5% to nearly 25% in the four previous years alone. The Government of
                    Senegal (GOS) had been locked in discussions with the IMF, the World Bank, and
                    France during 1979 to come up with a rescue plan. Behind this budget crisis, of
                    course, was a long-term productivity problem which grew out of a stagnating
                    rural economy. So the rescue plan had to correct the budget imbalance as soon as
                    possible, but at the same time it had to identify means of expanding
                    agricultural production. These were the very questions we had dealt with in
                    framing the Sahel Development Plan for the region as a whole. For this reason,
                    Dave was up to speed on the day he arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: As an outcome of the consultations with the Bank, the Fund, and the French,
                    Prime Minister Dioupresented to his National Assembly his Reform Plan, the Plan
                    de Redressement. He had done this only two or three weeks before I arrived. The
                    Plan laid out in a general way a two-step approach to stabilize and then
                    stimulate the economy. Naturally, donor support would be crucial to the success
                    of the Plan. Dave agreed wholeheartedly with the approach. We enthusiastically
                    adopted the Plan as our platform for working with the GOS and with the other
                    donors, with the aim of getting Senegal's economy moving decisively.</p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>Shortly after he had arrived, with Ambassador Hank Cohen's endorsement Dave made
                    a proposal to Senegal's Minister oPlan and Cooperation. This was that the U.S.
                    and Senegal carry out a joint assessment of the AID program as it had developed
                    in the period since the drought, 1974-1979. The Minister agreed. Dave further
                    proposed, and the Minister accepted, that we follow the assessment with a
                    revision of AID's program plan for the period 1983-1987. This revision would
                    incorporate the lessons to come out of the assessment. It would also make sure
                    that our future program worked in close support of the new Plan de
                    Redressement.</p>
                <p>The GOS accepted the proposal. The joint assessment would last six months and
                    would consist of three parts: first, an evaluation of four major AID projects,
                    selected to represent the four categories of work in which our program was
                    engaged (rain fed crops, irrigated agriculture, livestock, and village health);
                    second, a beneficiary study to be carried out by ENEA (the National School of
                    Applied Economics), to talk with the people in the field affected by these four
                    projects; and third, an analysis of the entire economic context, to be performed
                    by Elliot Berg. Both sides understood that this six month review would be
                    followed by the joint planning of AID's next five year program. The GOS also
                    accepted Dave's proposal that both the assessment and the planning phases would
                    be supervised by a joint management committee co-chaired by the Minister and the
                    U.S. Ambassador.</p>
                <p>Where I came in was, again, along the lines of what I had done in forming the
                    Sahel Development Program, to direct this twelve month exercise under Dave's
                    supervision and to pull the results together into a Country Development Strategy
                    Statement (CDSS) for the next five year period. All this accomplished, we
                    submitted our strategy to AID/W in January 1981. As you can imagine, 1980 was a
                    most intensive year, involving the best advisors we could find plus as much of
                    the U.S. and Senegalese community as we could bring in to critique our
                    assistance program and to help us reshape it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How long had we been involved in Senegal before you got
                        there? Did you remember reviewing any of the old programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: AID had operated in Senegal at a low level and in a general sort of way from
                    1961, the year after Independence, right through the great drought. In 1962 we
                    had made a $2 million grant for secondary schools, although I don't know the
                    details about that. For each year after that our program totaled $300,000 or
                    less, for studies connected with agriculturwater resources, seed improvement,
                    and so fortand for self-help projects and tech support. We seem to have had a
                    special interest in the Casamance region, the portion of Senegal lying south of
                    The Gambia. I didn't see the traces of any old projects.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>In the pre-drought era our Dakar office was responsible for the region which
                    included Mali and Guinea, as well as The Gambia and Mauritania. Capital
                    projects, especially roads and dams, were a priority then. But with the
                    exception perhaps of a regional training program and the rice research conducted
                    by WARDA, whose headquarters were in Liberia, I can't think of any significant
                    regional project which included Senegal itself. So it was not until 1973, with
                    the drought emergency relief effort, that AID got busy in Senegal per se in a
                    large way. By 1975 our Dakar regional office had been converted into a regular
                    country Mission for Senegal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you had a major collaborative program exercise with the
                        government. Was the Senegalese government really participating, were they
                        part of it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Yes, they were, at all levels, as much as their time would allow. The
                    trouble with collaboration, of course, is that it requires so much time! This
                    time constraint applied to the Senegalese in spades, since they had every other
                    donor at their door, along with ourselves. But at the top levels we kept the GOS
                    up on all we were doing, what we were finding out, and what we were considering
                    it would be best to do, and we received their input and consent. At the middle
                    levels, we included Senegalese officials on all our evaluation teams. And at the
                    grassroots, as I've mentioned, ENEA was interviewing “clients” to find out what
                    these beneficiaries of our projects felt about how useful they were. This all
                    fed into the redesign of the projects. I should add that we also made an effort
                    to get the point of view of PVOs and Peace Corps volunteers working in the same
                    areas as our projects.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they coming up with any grand new ideas or proposals
                        on this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: I must say, it was very hard to tell. Remember, we were working with the GOS
                    in the larger context of the IMF stand-by agreement and the Bank's structural
                    adjustment program, plus whatever else the French may have been counseling.
                    These conversations had been going on for much of 1979, before our evaluation
                    began. As a consequence, Diouf's Reform Plan laid out some fundamental changes,
                    such as the gradual replacement of the agriculture parastatal supply and
                    marketing agenciewhich were the prime beneficiaries of our prograwith private
                    traders and producer groups. Decentralization, a greater role for the private
                    sector, the closer involvement of the grassroots population in planning and
                    managing activitiethese were the big ideas involved. It's questionable that much
                    of the initiative to go in these new directions came from the GOS, or from our
                    evaluation exercise taken by itself. Our program enthusiastically accepted these
                    new directions and designed ways to help the GOS to adopt them. But we did add
                    one big new idea of our own. This was an activity in family planning, which we
                    saw as essential to stabilizing the population growth rate. And as I've said, we
                    linked this activity to the effort to improve village health and nutrition
                    services.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REA: French-educated Senegalese, which include all the officials we worked with,
                    are excellent diplomats, charming, evenly courtly, with a flair for formal
                    meetings and elegant turns of phrase. They are accustomed to dealing with the
                    West. More basic than manners, however, Senegalese are born traders, and they
                    understand they must give a little to achieve their main agenda. Consequently,
                    it was not easy to discern from their words and actions ithey were convinced by
                    our findings or only saying what they knew we wanted to hear. There was also the
                    “10 percent” factor, where some individuals were interested in their own gain.
                    But dealing with the Senegalese was very pleasant and our work there had at
                    least the illusion of progress. Perhaps some of that was real. Time will
                    tell.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REA: In the short term, at least, yes. In the review and redesign of our program,
                    I think we met each other half way. The GOS got what they needed most urgently,
                    namely, help with their budget crisis, and we got their consent to try some new
                    approaches, particularly in agriculture and health. The long term is another
                    matter. I don't hear encouraging words from the folks that know Senegal well
                    today. But our joint lack of success in achieving the results we expected to see
                    by now may stem less from the GOS's lack of political will (although that was
                    certainly a factor) than from Senegal's social inerti70% illiteracy, 45 year
                    life expectancy, and so on. In fact, we declared in our Strategy that we saw the
                    sorry state of the population to be the number one obstacle to reform.</p>

                <p>REA: Maybe the best way to answer that is to contrast the program we designed and
                    began to implement with the program we inherited from the 1974-1979 period.
                    There were four major differences, I think. First, non-project assistance (NPA)
                    played a greater role in our new program. This form of assistance financed
                    necessary imports and helped to ease the balance of payments crisiThe NPA
                    program also generated local currencies which we used for projects, as well as
                    for paying the local costs of policy studies. These studies, in turn, provided
                    us with good material for our so-called policy dialogue with the government. In
                    our FY 1982 budget for Senegal, reflecting the old program, NPA accounted for
                    about $17 million of the $35 million total. By FY 1984, NPA was up to $32
                    million of the total $54 million. A second way in which our program changed
                    after the evaluations was to place much greater emphasis on building up local
                    producer groups and off-farm private sector entrepreneurs. The big increase in
                    local currencies from our larger NPA program helped with this. Third, and I've
                    talked about this, we stressed collaboration with other donors based on the
                    IMF/World Bank program which had not been available in the past. Beginning with
                    the donors conference at the Bank's headquarters in Paris in October 1981, we
                    had one or two donor get-togethers each year. I remember best the meeting in
                    April 1983, held in Dakar with Club/CILSS support, at which we donors went over
                    with the Government of Senegal the entire agriculture sector reform plan.</p>
                <p>Fourth and finally, following the evaluation we did our best to consolidate all
                    our efforts from six areas of the country into three, those with the best
                    prospects for agriculture production. This clustering represented more than just
                    an administrative decision in favor of greater efficiency. It was really a
                    determination to do what we could to maximize yields, and as such it was a
                    reversal of the humanitarian relief policy which we had adopted after the
                    drought. Earlier we had gone after the hardest case areas, like Bakel, in the
                    far east of the country on the border with Mali.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did you take on the hardest cases?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: This was part of the disaster mentality which ruled in the early to
                    mid-Seventies in the Sahel. We were afraid that the rains could fail again in
                    any year. The people in these remote areas were the most vulnerable, and
                    reaching them with food was the most arduous and expensive. For these reasons,
                    the extreme cases got the most attention. When our emergency frame of mind
                    relaxed a bit, the natural next step was to build on the relief programs in the
                    places with which we were by then familiar. As a result, to stay with the Bakel
                    example, project design teams sent out from Washington in 1975 designed in Bakel
                    an irrigated perimeter project, a range management/livestock project, and even
                    that experimental solar power facility I mentioned a while ago. I recall from my
                    position on the SDP team in AID/W that when Norm Schoonover arrived as Director
                    in Dakar in 1975 he cautioned strongly against this scale of effort in such a
                    remote outpost. But by then the projects had already been approved. Norm had
                    recommended that we take the most promising areas and build on them. This is the
                    approach we finally adopted in 1980.</p>

                        the poor majority conflict in AID. That experience?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: At least a variant of that, yes. After 1980 in Bakel we got out of the solar
                    energy project when an evaluation exposed it as a white elephant. We also wound
                    down the range management/livestocprogram which proved to be too difficult to
                    administer properly at that distance. We moved the irrigation project out of our
                    bilateral program and into the Senegal River Basin (OMVS) office. This office,
                    which came to be led by Vito Stagliano, was located in the same building in
                    Dakar as our bilateral mission but was answerable to a council composed of the
                    three Mission Directors for Mali, Mauritania, and Senegal.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the perimeter approach work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: We were able to increase yields significantly but the effects were quite
                    localized. Also, we always had to question whether the cost of better pumps, for
                    example, would be covered by the value of the higher yields. The perimeter
                    approach contrasted with the plans for year-round farming which the large-scale
                    development of the Senegal Valley would permit. This approach required that two
                    large dams be built, one at Manantali in the east and the second at Diama at the
                    mouth of the river at Saint-Louis. That great scheme was the concern of our OMVS
                    office and was, as you say, another story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of the other programs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: To answer that, let me back up a minute and set the context. Our goafood
                    self-sufficiencwas the same goal as we had set for the Sahel Development Program
                    as a whole. We believed that this goal demanded a two track approach. It meant,
                    first, a concentration on increasing agricultural production in ways which
                    favored the maximum participation of the population, with care given to soil
                    regeneration and fuelwood concerns. Second, this goal called for an important
                    effort to improve the health and to upgrade the skills of the population, the
                    producers themselves. This second track included setting in place a means for
                    reducing the rate of population increase. By reducing the number of zones in
                    which we worked, our expectation was that the two tracks would work together
                    with the same beneficiary groups and reinforce each other.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>The Senegal program doubled in size in the time I was there and became one of the
                    largest AID country programs in Africa. As Director, Dave Shear was nothing if
                    not resourceful, and the Senegal program famously came to incorporate the entire
                    inventory of AID's funding spigots available at the time. We even helped open
                    some new ones. For example, we launched the first PL-480 Title III program in
                    Africa. Under this arrangement, Senegal accepted a loan for the purchase of U.S.
                    food and we agreed to forgive the loan to the extent that Senegal took the local
                    currencies which resulted from the sale of the food and then used them to
                    support development projects which we and the GOS agreed on together. Also for
                    the first time in Africa we married a Commodity Import Program (CIP) to an
                    agriculture sector grant. The CIP generated the local currencies needed to pay
                    in-country costs of the activities which the dollar grant initiated.</p>
                <p>A further example of innovation, not of spigots but of programs: we designed the
                    first Private Voluntary Organization (PVO) sector grant to be approved by the
                    Africa Bureau. Our object was to train entrepreneurs and organize farmer groups
                    at local levels, and thereby support the policy to decentralize the agriculture
                    sector. A final example of program innovation would be our introduction into the
                    Sahel area of family planning and nutrition programs linked to village
                    health.</p>
                <p>remember thinking at the time that our Agency did not have a single fund or type
                    of program available to Africa which we did not make use oand this included, of
                    course, the panoply of central programs administered by the (then) Science and
                    Technology Bureau. There may have been one or two we missed, but our programming
                    was certainly “creative” in this regard.</p>
                <p>Now to come closer to your question about our other programs. Beginning with the
                    agriculture track, I have to reiterate that we tried to support the Reform Plan
                    as well as we could. The IMF/World Bank adjustment program called for four
                    essential rural reforms: in agriculture extension practices, in the way farmers
                    were supplied with fertilizers and seeds, in the old, state-run “cooperatives”
                    by replacing many of their functions with farmer organizations, and in the way
                    credit was provided to rural producers. All four reforms were intended to work
                    together in the same direction, towards the progressive decontrol and
                    commercialization of rural production. The results of our evaluation, not
                    surprisingly, corroborated the wisdom of this shift in policy. So we modified
                    our projects and designed new ones to support the Reform Plan along these
                    lines.</p>
                <p>Of the program we inherited, the most important part was our support to Senegal's
                    three largest Rural Development Agencies (RDAs) SAED in the Senegal River Basin,
                    SODEVA in the Peanut Basin, and SOMIVAC in the Casamance. Because AID was a
                    major supporter of the RDAs, we found ourselves in the thick of the reform. As I
                    said before, these three RDAs in the mid-Seventies represented the best means
                    available of increasing production quickly. But now it was time to transform
                    them, if possible, from organizations which controlled inputs and set
                    conditions, to what might be called enabling or extension agencies, pure and
                    simple.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>So we designed ways to activate farmers groups in these three geographic areas,
                    while attempting to streamline the three RDAs to become effective extension
                    agencies in support of these farmers groups. At the same time, we also sought to
                    build up the agriculture research agency, ISRA, to introduce more effective farm
                    practices, with an emphasis on farming systems research. We designed ways to
                    improve soil and water management using, for example, agro-forestry techniques.
                    In addition, we worked to increase Senegal's cultivated land area, especially in
                    the Senegal Valley, as I've mentioned, but above all in the Casamance, where
                    water was also relatively plentiful.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, the major project we mounted therthe Casamance Integrated
                    Development Projecunder the able direction oU.S. project managers resident in
                    the Casamance, Charley Steedman and then Bob McAllister, became a classic
                    example of the inherent weakness of the integrated project approach. The many
                    facets of the project, which all had to be coordinated to achieve the desired
                    effect, overwhelmed the limited host-country management capacity. I must say, it
                    also taxed greatly our own ability to provide inputs on time, as needed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there some aspects of the integrated project approach
                        that you recall that worked?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Yes, quite a few. In the Casamance, for example, our project helped
                    establish links between the rice research station at Djibelor and WARDA's
                    principal station in Monrovia. The project's introduction of research packages
                    and water control measures raised rice and corn yields dramatically. In the
                    Senegal Basin, our integrated project with the OMVS regional commission
                    introduced incentives for private firms and operators to replace SAED in
                    providing services like pump repair and in processinproduce from some of the
                    irrigated perimeters.</p>
                <p>But even after listing these and other successes, we must recognize that our
                    integrated projects were aiming much higher. We were really attempting through
                    these many-sided projects to cultivate among the Senegalese a comprehensive way
                    of looking at the potential of a given region and to help them arrive at a
                    long-term plan for bringing the potential to fruition. This expectation
                    certainly was not met, even though certain elements worked pretty well. But
                    given how difficult it is for us ourselves to come up with a plan for the
                    Greater Washington, DC area, maybe the thinking behind our integrated projects
                    was, shall we say, futuristic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned a PVO project. How did that work? What was
                        the motivation behind that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>REA: Well, as I've said, we were trying to come up with a way to shift away from
                    the support we had been giving since 1975 to the parastatal organizations and
                    the centralized state system of agriculture production which they represented.
                    The GOS Reform Plan sought, among other things, to encourage the building up of
                    local producer groups and private sector service providers to replace the RDAs,
                    except in their function as extension agencies. In this vein, our PVO Community
                    and Enterprise project was directed at developing village level producer groups
                    in the Sine-Saloum area. Here, underground water reserves were satisfactory and
                    so farm production was more promising than elsewhere in the Peanut Basin.</p>
                <p>The project aimed at enabling Senegalese private voluntary organizations,
                    freestanding from the government, not only to assist with the training and
                    equipping of these local farmer groups, but also to help the growth of small
                    off-farm artisan enterprises to service these groups. As I've said, we planned
                    to use local currencies generated by the Ag Decentralization and Crediproject to
                    cover the local costs of the PVO project. Another part of the Credit project
                    was, at the same time, to strengthen the CNCA, Senegal's new private credit
                    institution. In these ways the two projects, one for PVOs, the other for credit,
                    worked together.</p>
                <p>We sent the PVO project plan to AID/W for approval in January 1983. Washington
                    took some time to review this new concept. And in the meantime, the GOS, which
                    initially had accepted the plan in principle, began to have second thoughts when
                    it became generally understood that several million dollars in aid money was
                    designated for private groups outside government control. At that time AID
                    funding for local PVOs, as contrasted with funding for international PVOs
                    working locally, was a new concept both in AID/W and in the field. Today it is
                    practiced widely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the Sine-Saloum. Was this the time of the
                        Sine-Saloum Health project?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Yes. This was the centerpiece, really, of the second track I mentioned a few
                    minutes ago. While working to introduce ways to increase agriculture production,
                    we were also attempting to improve the health and skills of the producers
                    themselves and their families. We laid out our health and training strategies in
                    a formal submission to AID/W. This was the January 1982 supplement to the main
                    CDSS strategy which we had submitted a year earlier.</p>
                <p>Our conviction was that it made no sense to talk about increasing farm production
                    if we were not prepared to help deal with the widespread debilitation of the
                    producers themselves, from infectious and diarrheal disease and malaria and
                    malnutrition. We could demonstrate that illness peaked in the rainy season just
                    prior to the annual harvests, thus weakening the labor force at a critical time.
                    Caloric intake was only 50% of adequate levels during the pre-harvest
                    period.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>Also relating to our goal of increasing per capita food production, we saw that
                    population growth rates unless diminished would double Senegal's population to
                    11,000,000 by about 2005. This increase threatened to nullify any gains in
                    productivity which could be made. To make matters worse, the urbanization rate
                    in Senegal was particularly high. Our forecast was that at rates current then,
                    40% oSenegal's population would be living in the Dakar-Thies region by 2005.
                    This would have the double whammy effect of further increasing the imports of
                    foods like rice, which were favored by city-dwellers but were not widely grown
                    in Senegal itself. At the same time, urbanization would reduce the rural labor
                    force available to food production.</p>
                <p>So what we proposed to do was to take about 6% of our program budget, not
                    including PL 480 programs, and create prototype health activities which would
                    address these problems at a cost which the GOS could support after we withdrew.
                    The most important of these health activities was the Sine-Saloum health care
                    program.</p>
                <p>Mike White, who I mentioned was the advisor to the CILSS in introducing the
                    village health approach to the Sahel program, came over from Ouagadougou to take
                    charge of our health/pop portfolio. The Sine-Saloum was his particular pet
                    concern. Following the evaluation we did of the rural health care program which
                    we had started in the Sine-Saloum in 1977, Mike reorganized the program to place
                    much more emphasis on the training of village committees and rural health
                    workers. He also championed the introduction of new elementmalaria control,
                    nutrition surveillance and education, oral rehydration therapy (ORT), and
                    immunization against measles, tetanus, and whooping cough. Under the revised
                    program, we also provided U.S. health and nutrition advisers at the regional and
                    central levels.</p>
                <p>Regarding the population “arm” oour program, Mike recommended that we begin in
                    urban clinics and health centers where family planning practices were apt to be
                    more readily accepted. So we started population activities under a separate
                    project labeled “Family Health,” with the expectation that later on, under Phase
                    II of the project, contraception devices would be distributed through pharmacies
                    and community health workers trained under the Sine-Saloum Rural Health project
                    at the village level.</p>
                <p>We systematically included health activities as elements of our irrigated
                    perimeter projects, as well. These supported surveillance and control of vector
                    born diseases, especially schistosomiasis. Altogether, in the Sine-Saloum and
                    elsewhere, our aim was to help the government create a self-sustaining rural
                    health care delivery system by establishing prototype activities from which we
                    could learthe most effective way to achieve rural health coverage.</p>

                        interests?</hi>

                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>REA: When we got there and took a second look, we found that the formal education
                    system had changed very little since the time of our appraisal five years
                    before. The coverage was inadequate, the orientation was skewed away from what
                    Nyerere had called “education for self-reliance,” and the system was in need oa
                    total overhaul. But we continued to believe that this was not about to happen..
                    The French had 1,000 teachers in the secondary and post-secondary levels. The
                    World Bank avoided reform and was funding a $6 million program for the
                    construction of primary schools. And the GOS and other French-educated elites
                    showed no serious resolve to reform the school system. We persisted in the
                    conviction that until they did, and until the donors most heavily involved in
                    supporting the school system organized behind a sound, long-term reform
                    strategy, AID's best course was to fund training programs related to increasing
                    agriculture production and improving health practices.</p>
                <p>We supportefour categories of training: first, training through state agencies
                    like the extension services of the RDAs; second, training through community
                    based organizations and PVOs; third, training through national training
                    organizations, like ENEA for rural officials, and also the school for livestock
                    agents; and finally, training through our regional programs like the Sahel
                    Manpower Development Program (SMDP). All of this supplemented the training we
                    routinely provided under our bilateral and regional projects to prepare
                    Senegalese to replace U.S. technical assistance personnel.</p>
                <p>The kinds of training we provided in these ways differed, of coursfunctional
                    literacy at the producer level, and so forth, depending on the need. Through
                    ENEA we were keen on providing rural officers with the basic tools of management
                    training, specifically project and financial management fundamentals. And we
                    made an effort — I'm not sure how successful it finally turned out to be — to
                    revive Senegal's rural radio programming for distance learning. But our contact
                    with the formal school system was limited to the training of education planners
                    at advanced degree levels, in anticipation of the day when the GOS would get
                    serious about systemic education reform. From what I can tell, even today the
                    GOS is still not at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Training was both inside and outside the country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: The SMDP-funded training for about 30 Senegalese each year was done by and
                    large in the U.S. Advanced management training, for example, took place for the
                    most part at the University of Pittsburgh's summer francophone management course
                    led so energetically there by Professor David Gould.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>But the large majority of the training we funded was in-country, even local. Our
                    larger goal was to build Senegal's capacity to offer better training itself. The
                    best example of this was our program with ENEA. Under their strong and
                    articulate Director, Cheikh Tidiane Sy, ENEA was a government school set up to
                    train rural development officers, such as cooperative agents. We allocated local
                    currencies to recondition ENEA's classes and offices, and we helped introduce
                    training in project management, as I've mentioned. This included project
                    identification, design, implementation, and evaluation techniques. Another of
                    our efforts to build training capacity in Senegal was the grant we made to ORT
                    International for the building and equipping of a technical school in Dakar. And
                    I must add, and not to appear politically correct, that we very consciously
                    emphasized the training of women in each and every one of these programs, from
                    the SMDP down to courses, or “stages,” at the most local levels in such things
                    as revenue producing activities of all kinds anthe use of fuel-efficient
                    cookstoves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the recent criticisms of the Sahel program was that
                        it didn't put enough emphasis on institutional development (I.D.), on human
                        resource development, and therefore the sustainability of the program by the
                        Sahelian peoples and governments was a problem. What was your view on I.D.?
                        Some people say it is a great thing; others pooh-pooh it. At that time
                        creating and strengthening institutions, was that a major concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: It was with us, most definitely. From my point of view, I cannot think of a
                    single thing we tried to do in Senegal which was not connected with the
                    development of a means to sustain that activity. And that meant, of course,
                    strengthening some sort of Senegalese institution, or helping to build a new
                    one. Of course, we may not have entirely succeeded. It was often very difficult
                    to find Senegalese candidates who were prepared and available for training, and
                    this was true at every level, not just with advanced training programs. But
                    despite the difficulties, the building of institutions to carry on the reforms
                    we helped to introduce was always in the front of our minds. As we saw it, the
                    development of effective Senegalese institutions was just the flip side of
                    policy reform and technology transfer.</p>
                <p>I think our commitment to I.D. is evident from what we've been talking about
                    until now. In our work to help decentralize the ag production system, for
                    example, I mentioned that we used whatever leverage we had to streamline the
                    RDAs as extension agencies. We helped to fund the private credit institution,
                    CNCA, and put that on the map. Through a Title XII arrangement with Michigan
                    State, we helped to restructure ISRA, the agriculture research institution, to
                    decentralize research and introduce a farm systems perspective. We gave help to
                    develop village level producer groups.</p>
                <p>It was the same on the health track. There, for example, we helped in the
                    Sine-Saloum to establish a system of village health huts and village committees
                    to manage them. As part of our population program, we helped ASBEF become a
                    private indigenous institution for the purpose of developing a public consensus
                    for family planning practices.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>The list of examples is a long one. When we developed a national plan for land
                    use in Senegal, we helped at the same time through another Title XII university,
                    South Dakota State, to create an institutional base at the University of Dakar
                    for updating the plan. When we introduced the mud and sand, ban ak souf,
                    cookstove for fuel efficiency, we did so under a renewable energy project
                    administered through CERER, the applied energy institute, also connected with
                    the University of Dakar. I could go on and on through every program we
                    supported.</p>
                <p>I should add that we applied this principle, especially, within our Mission. I
                    saw as one of my most important tasks in the Program Office, for example, the
                    on-the-job training of our very able Senegalese Program Assistants, Sedou Cisse
                    and Massar Beye, and of Mamadou Jallow before he left for long-term training in
                    the United States. Barbara Howard, who came in as my Deputy, and our excellent
                    French secretary, Monique Cressot, saw things exactly the same way. From all the
                    reports I get, Sedou and Massar are the absolute stalwarts of USAID/Senegal
                    today, ensuring the continuity of our program through all the comings and goings
                    of U.S. personnel.</p>
                <p>Whether or not we succeeded in building strong and enduring institutions,
                    however, I have my doubts for the most part. It was tough. Either the candidates
                    for training were not available, or we trained them and they were not used, or
                    host country funding was not provided after we withdrew, or else the
                    institutions we worked with were politically unsuccessful and failed. Growing
                    institutions in Senegal was a little like growing trees. The climate was harsh
                    and the varieties not always adapted to the conditions. But I can say that we
                    tried, from start to finish.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were there implementing the Sahel Development
                        Program. How did you see this vis � vis the French strategy and the Club and
                        all that when you looked at it from a country point of view?</hi>

                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>REA: Our work in building the program in Senegal was at least as all-consuming as
                    the effort we put into creating the Sahel Development Program in the 1974-1978
                    period. From my stand point, the Senegal effort was even more demanding. Maybe
                    for this reason I lost some of my objectivity, buI think by the early Eighties
                    that the Club/CILSS framework had served its most important function. This was
                    to open up major policy issues, and especially the sensitive ones like price
                    policy, to public discussion and to continuing private dialogue — which,
                    naturally, could and should take place at the country level. Of course, the
                    Club/CILSS deserved to continue, but from my vantage point in Senegal their
                    principal function thereafter was to keep the flag flying which we had worked so
                    hard to hoist, the flag of donor/beneficiary cooperation, the long view and the
                    big picture. We really had very little to do in Dakar with the Club/CILSS system
                    after 1980 while I was there. The important thing was that the Club/CILSS were
                    keeping the needs of the region as a whole before the general donor public,
                    including our Congress, and were informing the technical and scientific
                    communities which were the source of our best advisors. In this way more than
                    any other the Club/CILSS continued to be valuable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Otherwise you were operating quite independently of the
                        Club. We had a Washington Sahel unit. Dave was no longer there, but we had
                        the structure and the concept. What happened to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: The Sahel Desk was very important to us. It was our pipeline into the Africa
                    Bureau especially, and into the Agency generally. Jim Kelly was Director for
                    much of this time and did a fine job in getting us the resources we needed and
                    in keeping us in the Sahel loop. Now that the general directions had been set
                    and the country programs were in full operation, program implementation was the
                    name of the game. Unavoidably, most of the implementation work had to be done at
                    the country level, with whatever resources we could get. The amplitude of our
                    resources depended on how well the Sahel Office and Club/CILSS could keep our
                    objectives clearly before the eyes of the Agency and the Congress. In addition
                    to this, the Sahel Office haresponsibility for some large regional programs, to
                    be sure, and some of these affected Senegal directly. But the Club/CILSS Working
                    Group meetings subsided once they had proposed the projects and strategies to
                    follow. The spotlight shifted to project selection, funding, and implementation.
                    These activities took place mostly at the country level.</p>

                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>REA: From my perspective, the Club/CILSS mechanism worked extremely well to get
                    the ball rolling and to make sure that it continued to roll. We were ready to
                    deal by then with the problems they had identifiestorage, fuelwood, pricing,
                    recurrent costs, and so obut the dealing had to be done primarily in each of the
                    eight countries. And with this many countries in the region, the Club/CILSS were
                    not prepared to coordinate very much at that “retail” level. Only in the one big
                    donor meeting I mentioned, the one in 1983 to review the GOS agriculture sector
                    reform program, do I recall the Club/CILSS playing a direct role in Senegal.
                    Let's not forget that the Club, especially, was set up to be a “light”
                    organization with no permanent staff, perhaps only five or six officers seconded
                    from donor organizations like ours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see, so the action just sort of moved to a country
                        level. First of all, it got started and the resources got mobilized and then
                        it became a country program. But the regional concept was that the program
                        was to have major region-wide projects with country-wide components. Is that
                        correct?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: There were important region-wide projects with country components, that's
                    correct. The river basin development commissions for the Senegal and Niger
                    Rivers, for example, were intended to work this way. So was the weather
                    forecasting service, Agrymet, the Famine Early Warning System (FEWS), and the
                    pests and locust program, as well, because each of these dealt with cross-border
                    phenomena. Our work with ICRISAT, the world-wide dry lands ag research group
                    with headquarters in Hyderabad, India, is another case in point. ICRISAT
                    established a sub-station in Niger for the Sahel. But even here, their genetic
                    improvements at a regional level had to be modified to country and even local
                    level specifications. Also, there were some instances like the SMDP training
                    program where we within AID organized regional accounts for simplicity sake. It
                    was more efficient for us to have a single advanced training account with eight
                    sub-accounts, for example, than to have eight separate projects for the same
                    kind of training.</p>
                <p>But the heart of the matter was always increased agriculture productivity, and
                    this meant the adoption of policies and approaches which would transform the way
                    agriculture was carried out in specific locations. Farming methods often
                    differed from area to area, even within countries. So the adoption of new
                    approaches went back, inevitably, to the governments and institutions of
                    individual countrieto decentralize and privatize and so forth. Change could only
                    come through the member states themselves. The Sahel Program umbrella did its
                    best work, I thought, in making respectable the open discussion of sensitive and
                    important problems.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>After this, the Club/CILSS continued to make possible common approaches to common
                    problems. I understand that in the early Nineties, for example, the mechanism
                    was very helpful in securing a Food Aid Charter protocol among donors, which
                    resulted in a significant reduction of the amount of food aid required in the
                    region. The Club/CILSS served, too, as a transmission belt for sharing between
                    countries new and better ways of doing things. So, yes, the regional approach
                    continued to be useful even after the most important action moved to the country
                    level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, anything else, you were there what, four years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Yes, four and a half years, from January 1980 to July 1984. Dave had arrived
                    as Director two months before I joined the Mission, and left about six months
                    earlier than I. This means that including the time we had spent in Washington,
                    Dave and I worked closely together for a total of eight years. That may be
                    something of a record for collaboration in AID's foreign service. I consider
                    myself remarkably fortunate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find program work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Generally speaking, I felt more at home in the program office than I did
                    wearing my education/training hat. What most appealed to me about program work
                    was the view it allowed of the whole picture in a country, and the opportunity
                    it gave to do strategic planning. My academic preparation, after all, had been
                    in history and politics and in African area studies. I had no professional
                    degrees or formal training in education. It's just that from the start, even as
                    an undergraduate, I came to see education as the most important single key to
                    development, especially in Africa, and so I partly gravitated in that
                    direction.</p>
                <p>As for prior program experience by this time, I had had an excellent dose of
                    program work in setting up the Botswana program and in framing the Sahel
                    Development Program, as well as in my liaison capacity in Paris. And even in the
                    four years of education work I had done with AID - two years in Tanzania and two
                    years on the SDP team after it was created in Washington - I was seen as an
                    “education program officer,” a hybrid animal. Remember, too, that my starting
                    point before I came to AID had been “the politics of education,” a hybrid
                    topic.</p>
                <p>In any case, my next position after Senegal was pure program worin fact, a
                    program officer's dream assignment. From the time I joined AID, this was the
                    only job which I ever wrote a letter and applied for.</p>

                <p>REA: I left Dakar on June 30, 1984. About a year before this, when I began to
                    think about what to do next, I had had a hunch that AID might be getting ready
                    to open a new program on Madagascar, “the Great Red Island” in the Indian Ocean.
                    In December 1983, I took the unusual step for me of writing the Deputy Assistant
                    Administrator for Africa at the time, Ray Love, to apply for a jobut it was a
                    job that did not yet exist: to “help put together an expanded program in
                    Madagascar,” as I think I put it. Ray forwarded my request to John Koehring, the
                    REDSO Director in East Africa, who had responsibility for Madagascar as part of
                    the regional program there.</p>
                <p>Though I did not know it at the time, John had just taken as his Deputy Art Fell,
                    who must have put in a good word for me based on our collaboration in Paris.
                    John and Art had, in fact, been tasked with starting new activities in
                    Madagascar and were looking for an officer who would be permanently stationed in
                    the capital, Antananarivo (Antan, for short). The leading candidate for the job,
                    REDSO's chief Program Officer, Jim Graham, declined the offer. Jim was the
                    natural choice because he had directed the preparatory work and exploratory
                    study required before a resident officer could be assigned there. So in the
                    Spring of 1984, John invited me to fill the new position of REDSO's “Program
                    Officer for Madagascar,” resident in Antan and responsible to John himself as
                    REDSO Director. I was to be the first representative of AID resident in
                    Madagascar since our previous bilateral mission had closed there in 1972.</p>
                <p>To repeat, I saw this as the dream assignment. Responsibility for developing a
                    Madagascar program from nearly scratch as the “AID man in Antan” gave me a great
                    sense of challenge and adventure. It also provided me with the best support
                    group I could possibly have asked fothe multidisciplinary REDSO team in Nairobi
                    led by John, Art, and Jim and, at a second echelon, the Science and Technology
                    Bureau in AID/W. My assignment to begin with was two-fold: First, I was to
                    direct a program of short-term help and exploration; and second, concurrent with
                    that, I was to prepare a program of long-term assistance which AID could
                    implement at such time as the U.S. was convinced that the Government of
                    Madagascar (the GDRM) was truly committed to policies of economic liberalization
                    and reform. If this were to happen, AID would then be prepared to move ahead
                    quickly with long-term development assistance at higher funding levels.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>REA: Madagascar's situation was dismal. AID/W, then REDSO, briefed me on the
                    Malagasy economy on my way out to Antan. As I read and heard about it, the
                    situation appeared similar to the one we had faced in Senegal four years before.
                    An economic emergency marked by the hemorrhaging of foreign exchange, an
                    avalanche of debt, and a crisis of credit-worthiness had forced the government
                    to negotiate a stand-by agreement with the IMF and a structural adjustment
                    program with the World Bank. The other strong similarity with Senegal was that
                    France was an important player here, as well. Madagascar was, in fact, France's
                    second largest recipient of foreign aid after Senegal. So the main features of
                    the situation appeared very familiar.What I found puzzling at firsand a source
                    of frustration latewas the lack of an apparent cause for such dire
                    circumstances. Years of drought preceded our rescue effort in Senegal and the
                    Sahel, but the reasons for Madagascar's crisis did not lie on the surface. The
                    island was just as poor in terms of GNP/capita as Sahelian countries. Yet with
                    the exception of the extreme south it was well-watered. Education statistics for
                    Madagascar were much better than for the Senegalese. Remember, too, that
                    Madagascar is very sizeable, the fourth largest island on earth (after
                    Greenland, Borneo, and New Guinea), with an area larger than France, with good
                    harbors, ample natural resources, and a long history of exposure to the West. At
                    first, all this just didn't seem to jibe with the situation I saw when I
                    arrived.</p>
                <p>My initial impression of the country is still vivid. I had caught an early
                    morning flight from Nairobi after my REDSO briefing. We crossed the Mozambique
                    Channel an hour after dawn. I recall my astonishment as I looked out the plane
                    window on the land between the coast and Antan and I remember thinking to
                    myself: “What is thithe surface of the moon?” On the ground during my first few
                    days I was shocked by the clusters of beggars, most of them children, clamoring
                    for hand-outs in the streets. Clearly, the national situation called for
                    vigorous action.</p>
                <p>By contrast, my work situation was very positive. The Embassy, led at the time by
                    Ambassador Robert Keating and his admirable DCM, Dave Rawson, who were my
                    day-to-day supervisors, had set aside two rooms on the ground floor for our AID
                    offices. REDSO had recruited a Malagasy business woman, Agnes Rakotomalala, as
                    my Administrative Assistana brilliant choicand she was already at work. REDSO
                    had also lined up a house which was soon ready for me and my new bride, AID
                    education officer Julie Owen, to move in. And there were a great deal of
                    introductions to be made in the GDRM and the donor community.</p>
                <p>The program situation when I arrived reflected REDSO's careful preparation.
                    Beginning the summer before, Jim Graham, Stu Callison (the REDSO economist), and
                    many others had visited the island and put together a “preliminary” CDSS
                    strategy, finally dated May 1984. This included a thick annex with the
                    information they had collected on Madagascar's society, economy, agriculture and
                    transport sectors. It was a good tentative plan for what should be done in the
                    near term, until we could learn more. It highlighted the right areas and pointed
                    in the right directions. REDSO's 1984 plan was the groundwork for the foundation
                    we were to build over the next four years, before my departure in the summer of
                    1988. AID's current program in Madagascar today has been built squarely on that
                    foundation.</p>

                        happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: A violent uprising that year overthrew the government which had ruled
                    Madagascar since Independence in 1960. The outgoing government had been
                    virtually a continuation of French colonialism under ruling local elites. The
                    gulf between haves and have-nots had widened until the social situation had
                    become intolerable. The 1972 uprising began the socialist revolution which
                    Didier Ratsiraka consolidated when he became President in 1975.</p>
                <p>Initially, AID had supervised activities in Madagascar from Nairobi. Then in 1966
                    a Mission was established at Antan. Since an American presence was not welcome
                    after the 1972 riots, we closed the Mission. But despite some 20 years of active
                    interest there before 1981, AID had not been a key player in Madagascar. Our
                    total assistance between 1962 and 1978 amounted to only $20 million. Half of
                    this had been devoted to a Food for Peace PL 480 Title II program, managed
                    locally by Catholic Relief Services (CRS). When program management moved back to
                    Nairobi in 1972, AID stopped making grants but continued humanitarian assistance
                    through CRS. Our multi-year loans for capital projects in railways and
                    telecommunications also continued but they were supervised from Nairobi by REDSO
                    personnel on short visits to the island.</p>
                <p>The loans were not renewed, however, when Ratsiraka in 1977 embarked on an
                    all-out public investment program. The GDRM decided to take out high-cost
                    foreign loans to pay for non-productive capital projects. The government did so
                    just at the time when the world terms of trade were turning against Malagasy
                    exports. Because this course of action seemed doomed to failure, the U.S. cut
                    off all aid at that point, save always for the CRS food aid. Other Western
                    donors did likewise. The Socialist countries saw an opportunity and moved in.
                    But soon, by 1980, Madagascar was flat broke. President Ratsiraka was obliged to
                    change policies abruptly and to come to terms with the IMF/World Bank.</p>
                <p>Naturally, before reopening a development assistance program in Madagascar we
                    wanted to make reasonably sure (a) that the GDRM meant what it said about
                    economic reform and (b) that the GDRM was ready and able to bear the political
                    costs of economic reform. If the answer to both questions turned out to be
                    positive, we wanted to be in a position at that point to move quickly to
                    implement a sound, long-term development program.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>REA: Washington had been alarmed by the anti-Western stance of the Ratsiraka
                    government. Our concern had particularly to do with Madagascar's strategic
                    location on the major shipping lane through the Mozambique Channel. So as soon
                    as Ratsiraka declared that he was willing to deal again with the West and
                    consider economic reform, we had a strong incentive to offer renewed short-term
                    help. We provided this help in 1981 in the form of a $5 million PL 480 Title I
                    program. The commodity was rice, which became the centerpiece of our program
                    throughout the entire decade to follow.</p>
                <p>Why rice? Rice is the staple food of the Malagasy, who were said at the time to
                    consume more rice per capita than any people on earth.—three heaping platefuls
                    apiece, when it could be had, morning, noon, and night. Madagascar up until the
                    revolution had exported a very high quality rice, but for a number of policy
                    reasons found itself by the end of the Seventies a net importer. In 1980, with
                    their foreign exchange reserves very low, the GDRM welcomed the Title I program.
                    We repeated the program again in 1982 at the same level, and in 1983 increased
                    the program to $8 million, including this time some vegetable oil which had by
                    then become a nutritional necessity. When I arrived in 1984, REDSO was
                    negotiating a repeat of the 1983 program. All four of these Title I programs
                    involved the allocation of counterpart funds to specified local capital
                    development activities. REDSO saw the supervision of the Title I counterpart
                    program as one of my main tasks. This involved the selection with the GDRM of
                    worthwhile local projects and the monitoring of their progress. At the same
                    time, as I've said, REDSO wanted to design a program to position us so that, if
                    the GDRM demonstrated its commitment to new reform policies, we would be able to
                    step in quickly with appropriate long-term development support. My overall
                    assignment was to establish a presence for AID in the country and, in day-to-day
                    touch with the GDRM, with the other donors and private groups, to guide the
                    evolution of a multi-year AID Program.</p>

                <p>REA: As we had in Senegal in a similar economic emergency, the U.S. supported the
                    IMF/World Bank policy reform package. But, as I've said, unlike our Senegal
                    program, the U.S. was not yet ready in Madagascar in 1984 to commit fully to a
                    sustained, long-term effort. REDSO and the Embassy saw our immediate objectives
                    in Madagascar in different but complementary ways. In the Embassy's view, the
                    AID program should demonstrate visible and timely support of the GDRM's opening
                    to the West and to market reform. AID's preoccupation at first was with Basic
                    Human Needs and with responding to urgent economic requirements.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>Within these parameters, REDSO's preliminary CDSS of 1984 focused our assistance
                    on the agriculture sector — where 85% of Malagasy were employed and where
                    private, small-holder production prevailed. REDSO'plan was to continue our
                    balance of payments support under PL 480 Title I. We would use the counterpart
                    funds to pay local costs to rehabilitate feeder roads and dikes, which were
                    vital to production and which were in deplorable shape. The preliminary CDSS
                    also directed us within the agriculture sector to pay special attention to rice
                    production, for the reasons I've given. Included in this was financing for the
                    first resident team in the sub-Saharan region from IRRthe International Rice
                    Research Institute, headquartered in the Philippines. Added to agriculture, the
                    1984 CDSS also included a note of concern over the absence of any family
                    planning program in a country whose population growth was far outstripping
                    economic growth.</p>
                <p>That is where my four year tour began. On paper my reporting responsibilities
                    looked a great deal the same as they did when I worked in Botswana to open that
                    program some twelve years before. My AID supervisor was located in another
                    country while my Ambassador was, almost literally, in the next office. But the
                    ambassadorial personalities and backgrounds were very different. In Gaborone,
                    Ambassador Nelson had been a former AID Director who instinctively viewed
                    diplomacy through the lense of economic development. By contrast, Ambassador
                    Keating, who remained at the Embassy's helm for my first two years or so, was an
                    Annapolis graduate and political appointee with some relevant World Bank
                    experience. His most important moments, as he saw it, were his private
                    discussions with President Ratsiraka (another former naval officer) about the
                    global big-picture.</p>
                <p>Whenever Ambassador Keating thought about the AID program, his principal interest
                    was that it should be highly visible. He wanted to demonstrate with headlines
                    and in pictures the concern of the American people for the distress of the
                    Malagasy. He repeated to me often that what he wanted was a “Rapid Rea Ready
                    Reaction” program, specially keyed to food imports, hurricane disaster aid
                    (which was required after the cyclones each Spring), and to ribbon-cutting and
                    flag-planting activities. An example was the Bailey bridge which the Ambassador
                    insisted that AID should finance to replace a washed out structure in the
                    Namakia area of NW Madagascar. After much hassle, the bridge was ceremonially
                    opened just after I got to post.</p>
                <p>I have little doubt that if it had not been for the stout presence of REDSO,
                    which had the responsibility for aid to Madagascar, and for the quasi-autonomy
                    of AID itself, that our work on the island might have amounted to a
                    well-publicized relief and rehabilitation program. We would probably not have
                    tackled the root problems of low agricultural production, environmental
                    degradation, and surging population growth. I think of that keenly today when I
                    see evidence of our Agency slipping closer to absorption into the State
                    Department and to becoming the main manager of Presidential Initiatives in
                    developing countries.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>But as it was, I think we laid the foundations in 1984-88 for a balanced,
                    effective long-term development program. I'll try to outline what it looked like
                    without too much detail. Madagascar was a stand-alone program, after all, unlike
                    what we did in Senegal under the Sahel Development Program. Senegal was part of
                    a larger scheme of things and therefore, perhaps, of greater interest. Also,
                    regrettably, our Madagascar program has suffered from subsequent political
                    paralysis on the island, most acutely in 1991. The GDRM's political gridlock has
                    partially prevented the program, at least so far, from becoming as effective as
                    it might have been. Nevertheless, the Madagascar program is worth attention
                    because it became something of a model for what our Africa Bureau as a whole was
                    attempting to do at the time.</p>
                <p>Stated briefly, the increased production of higher quality rice became our main
                    focus, with two supporting program elements: family planning and, almost
                    entirely missing from the initial 1984 plan, conservation oMadagascar's unique
                    bio-diversity. These three elements fit together well anwere, in the longer
                    term, interdependent.</p>
                <p>Our initial approach in 1984 was to learn as much as we could about agriculture
                    on the island. This approach was embodied in the Madagascar Agriculture
                    Rehabilitation and Support (MARS) project, signed in 1985 and amended in 1987.
                    Deliberately designed as a “smorgasbord” program, MARS provided a total of $7.5
                    million for training, technical assistance, and policy studies in virtually all
                    areas of the agriculture sector, and it also helped with the import of critical
                    commodities. MARS was designed to give us broad knowledge of the agriculture
                    sector, so that later we could select the portion most conducive to long-term
                    concentration. But rice production quickly emerged as the area in which AID
                    could have the greatest long-term effect. We saw very soon that we could be
                    useful there in two principal ways.</p>
                <p>Our intervention through IRRI was designed to make a vital contribution: to
                    improve the varieties of rice and the technical packages available to Malagasy
                    farmers. Over the years since Independence, Madagascar had prohibited the import
                    of the improved rice varieties developed at IRRI and elsewhere which had figured
                    so prominently in Asia's Green Revolution. Our IRRI activity was implemented by
                    means of a two man team resident in Madagascar, backed up btraining and
                    expertise at IRRI headquarters. In close collaboration with their Malagasy
                    counterparts, IRRI aimed at carrying out a classic sequence of activities: to
                    select from the world seed bank those rice varieties with characteristics most
                    germane to conditions in Madagascar, to import these varieties, cross them with
                    local varieties to make them more hardy, test them on station and in farmers'
                    fields, then to make them available for wide distribution to farmers together
                    with the most appropriate fertilizers, also as tested. At the same time, of
                    course, IRRI would be making a concerted effort to prepare Malagasy research and
                    technical staff and institutions to take entire responsibility for the rice
                    program when IRRI departed. To accomplish all this in a reasonable span of time
                    — a decade or so — given all the resistence built into the Malagasy research and
                    production system, was a stiff challenge.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>But our second contribution to rice production, an essential one, was even more
                    ambitious. Looming over the failure othe rice sector in the years since 1972 was
                    the policy question — the set of policies by which the GDRM under Ratsiraka had
                    kept careful control over the price of rice in urban markets, thereby creating
                    price disincentives to Madagascar's rice producers. A further effect of these
                    market controls was to encourage rice traders on the island to hold their stocks
                    in an attempt to force up consumer prices.</p>
                <p>The World Bank's VP for African operations, Kim Jaycox, came to Antan shortly
                    after I arrived. His prime mission was to reach agreement with President
                    Ratsiraka on a way to free up the market price of rice. The stakes were high on
                    both sides. The Bank and the rest of the donor community realized that market
                    liberalization reforms, essential to increasing agriculture production, would go
                    nowhere if rice, the key staple, was left out of the program. The President saw
                    just as clearly that to remove price controls on rice without absolute assurance
                    that adequate rice stocks would be available in the event of a poor harvest
                    could result in a rocketing of rice prices, public outrage, and the end of his
                    government.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Keating was invited to attend these discussions, and AID played a key
                    part in the solution which emerged. Under the brand new PL 480 Food For Progress
                    program, which Keating himself had helped devise even while he was Ambassador to
                    Madagascar, the U.S. promised to provide a buffer stock of rice for each of
                    three consecutive years until domestic rice production, in response to free
                    market price incentives, could increase sufficiently to guarantee ample domestic
                    supplies. As a respected, neutral observer to help determine if the program was
                    working as planned, we invited Elliot Berg to come out for two or three visits
                    and report on the progress, or lack of progress, of the program.</p>
                <p>In early 1987 we delivered 30,000 metric tons of rice, the first tranche of the
                    FFP program, to constitute a reserve stock as a complement to the April rice
                    harvest. The GDRM decontrolled prices. Elliot came in June to inspect the
                    results and file a report. His findings confirmed that the program was on the
                    right track. His analysis ended with the comment that this event was probably
                    the first time that an indirect policy instrumenthe use of the market instead of
                    direct controlhad “shown its power”. We experienced many frustrations with the
                    GDRM over this program but we had no doubt after 1987 that we were headed in the
                    right direction.</p>
                <p>After research and policy reform, the third element of our rice production
                    strategy, as I said a while ago, was repairing local infrastructure. As the
                    economy had worsened, rural roads and water control dikes and the terracing
                    necessary for rice production and marketing had suffered serious neglect. To
                    help “fix what was broke” at local levels, we allocated a portion of the local
                    currencies which accrued from the sale of the commodities which had been
                    imported since 1981 under the PL 480 Title I program, under the MARS project,
                    and from other activities of ours. These funds totaled over $65 million by June
                    1988.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>This was a considerable sum, and I should say here that we made two evaluations
                    of the counterpart program. The first evaluation reported that the 166 local
                    projects (dams, roads, etc.) we had completed by December 1987, with 200 more
                    still on-going, had generated enormous good will for the U.S. at local levels.
                    That was the good news. The second evaluation looked at the program from an
                    economic angle and judged that these 166 projects, by and large, had done little
                    to increase productioat least, not yet.</p>
                <p>In either case, the process by which our counterpart funds were allocated needed
                    to be adjusted. Reviewing and approving projects from extensive lists submitted
                    each year by 13 different GDRM agencies was time consuming. The actual GDRM
                    transfer of these funds to the project accounts was often and inexplicably
                    delayed, in some cases by as much as two years. By the time I left we had
                    reorganized the program to allocate the majority of our counterpart funds to a
                    few, much larger projects which supported our overall program. These projects
                    included, for example, the rehabilitation of rice research stations associated
                    with IRRI and the repair of feeder roads under the multi-year World Bank Highway
                    project. Also included were two or three other projects in the areas of family
                    health and the environment, which I'll get to in a minute. But in addition to
                    making the allocation process much simpler, we also came to agreement with the
                    GDRM that our counterpart funds would be placed “on budget,” that is, the funds
                    would be part of the regular, publically voted annual budget where they could be
                    “found” and transferred in much more timely fashion.</p>
                <p>After rice production, the second of the three major components of the Madagascar
                    program by the time I left in July 1988 was the conservation of the environment.
                    Conservancy went hand-in-hand with our work in agriculture. The moonscape which
                    greeted me on the morning I first flew into Antan had been the result omany
                    years of over-grazing and slash-and-burn production techniques. Obviously, we
                    needed to work out ways in which the local populations would see their interests
                    best served by protecting their unique environment, at the same time as they
                    were enabled to farm more intensively on adjacent areas.</p>
                <p>Bio-diversity was not part of the original REDSO game plan when I arrived. But
                    its importance grew clearer to us, and to the international community, very
                    quickly. World Wildlife and many other groups listed Madagascar and the
                    Brazilian rainforest together at the top of their global conservation “watch
                    lists.” Madagascar as the world's most exotic “living laboratory” of unique
                    species was shrinking before our eyes.</p>
                <p>Our initial approach, made on a low-cost, pilot basis, was to select several of
                    the highest prioritecological areas on the island and then to arrange and
                    support collaborative ventures in each of them between the local inhabitants and
                    a Malagasy PVO, with the expert help of an international PVO. Their joint
                    objective was to work out sustainable ways to conserve bio-diversity while at
                    the same time achieving a satisfactory level of agriculture production or other
                    means of supporting the local population.</p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>We began by assisting the project whicAllison Richards of Yale University had
                    already started in the southwest at Beza Mahafaly in conjunction with the
                    University of Madagascar. In June 1987 Donna Stauffer joined me as the second
                    Direct Hire officer in the office. Donna had great enthusiasm for this
                    environmental work, although she also had across-the-board responsibility for
                    all our project design and management. Before I left we had arranged a
                    combination of dollar grants and counterpart funding to support two more
                    environmental pilot projects.</p>
                <p>The first, locatein the north at Amber Mountain, combined World Wildlife
                    International and the local CRS organization in Madagascar. The second, in the
                    island's largest remaining virgin rain forest, the Masoala Peninsula on the
                    northeast shore, supported collaboration between Missouri Botanical Gardens and
                    the Madagascar Lutheran Church. In addition to these location-specific
                    activities we pledged major support using our counterpart funds to cover local
                    costs of the World Bank-assisted Environmental Action Plan process, which began
                    in March 1987. Donna was particularly convinced of the importance of building
                    collaborative relationships in the environmental area. She was largely
                    responsible for carrying this work forward in a more consolidated projectized
                    form after I left.</p>
                <p>The third and final component of our program in Madagascar was family planning.
                    The need for this was stark. As I've suggested, Madagascar's population growth
                    rate was one of the highest in the world, estimated at over 3% per annum. In
                    1975 an uncompleted census indicated that there were 7.5 million Malagasy; in
                    the mid-1980's the total was estimated aabout 10.5 million; and the latest
                    figures I've seen put today's population at some 14 million. These figures
                    represent a doubling of population in 20 years. Add to this, that only about 15%
                    of the land area of the Great Red Island is considered arable, with topsoil
                    being washed into the seyou've seen the satellite picturein spectacular
                    quantities each year. The traditional Malagasy marriage blessing was “May you
                    have seven sons and seven daughters.” Contraceptive use was among the lowest in
                    the world. The World Bank called this high population growth rate Madagascar's
                    most important long term issue.</p>
                <p>Until the time I arrived, there had been no attempt by the government or local
                    leaders to address this problem, although at least one private group was active
                    — but with little success. The REDSO survey in 1983, however, had detected some
                    further inklings of interest in family planning, if it were introduced
                    discreetly. I was confident from my experience in Senegal that our Agency had
                    the central resources needed to respond in effective ways. Barbara Kennedy,
                    REDSO's population officer, entirely agreed. We began with a population and
                    family health survey which Barbara organized in 1985. Based on the findings of
                    this survey, the RAPID project made an excellent presentation which was attended
                    by a wide selection of national and local leaders. Many of them came away
                    shaking their heads, saying they had never before conceived of the population
                    phenomenon in Madagascar, nor considered its effects on national development ten
                    and twenty years in the future. After this, with the encouragement of Madame
                    Ratsiraka, we were told, the GDRM gave us a cautious green light to proceed.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>We knew we would have our hands full, once population activities got underway. We
                    could expect a stream oS&amp;T/POP professional people who would be coming to
                    follow up on the opportunity in conjunction with Malagasy from the private and
                    public arenas. As a full-time coordinator within our office, we were most
                    fortunate to employ Mr. Gerard Rakotondrainibe. He came to us with long
                    experience abroad with UNFPA, as well as experience at home with the Malagasy
                    private group engaged in the field. Gerard became the second Malagasy
                    professional in our office after Agnes. He proved invaluable to us in orienting
                    our outside specialists and linking them up with the right people in country.
                    From 1985 to 1988 we received all the help we needed in working with the GDRM to
                    formulate and draft a national population strategy, to disseminate and explain
                    it, and to keep the plan updated on the basis of good demographic statistics.
                    Our Bureau of the Census gave sound assistance in preparing a new national
                    census. Specialists provided by S&amp;T/POP's OPTIONS and IMPACT projects worked
                    specifically on the development of the population policy and the building of its
                    data base. S&amp;T's FISA program supplied contraceptive materials to Malagasy
                    private sector institutions which wanted to offer family planning services to
                    their employees.</p>
                <p>My work with Mike White in Senegal had persuaded me that family planning works
                    best when it is part of a comprehensive program for family health, particularly
                    to include young children. Given AID's “focus and concentrate” directives, it
                    would have been out of the question to open a health program of our own at that
                    time in Madagascar. Fortunately, however, I found a way to team up with UNICEF,
                    which in 1987 was preparing to design with the Ministry of Health a five year
                    child support program. This program would provide ORT/immunization services to
                    at least 80% of all Malagasy children on a phased basis, taking on a different
                    section of the country in each successive year. At our request, S&amp;T/Health
                    provided a planner who had a strong track record with UNICEF, and he was most
                    helpful in designing a practical plan which we all coulsupport. We then pledged
                    $2.2 million in counterpart funds to pay the local costs of the program. This
                    was the first time to my knowledge that AID and UNICEF had worked together in
                    this way. I left before the program got underway, but the agreed plan, at least,
                    was that our family planning effort would receive a family health complement, in
                    effect, as the two programs proceeded side by side.</p>
                <p>Our program in Madagascar, composed of these three elementagriculture (with a
                    focus on rice production), environmental protection, and family planninwas in
                    place by 1987. The GDRM had continued to abide by the structural reform program
                    of the World Bank sufficiently well, and had satisfied each of the annual IMF
                    standby agreements since 1983. In consequence, Madagascar's budget deficit had
                    fallen from 18% oGDP to 4% since the beginning of the decade.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>Encouraged by all this, and by our REDSO reports, the AID Administrator acted in
                    May 1987 to upgrade the REDSO program office in Antan to “the Office of the AID
                    Representative in Madagascar.” As the AID Rep, I now reported directly to the
                    Deputy Assistant Administrator for Africa, Larry Saiers, who depended on REDSO
                    for “advice” and on his East African desk in AID/W to give us administrative
                    support. I was asked to revise the 1984 CDSS to offer a long-term strategy. A
                    review of our program was scheduled for the Fall. A small team of impartial
                    observers, led by Jim Kelly, a former Director of the Sahel Program, by then
                    retired, came out to prepare a “concepts paper” to guide the review. The review
                    took place between October 3November 18, 1987. Larry Saiers himself led the
                    review, which included top REDSO personnel.</p>
                <p>The review confirmed the main lines of the program we had developed and which
                    I've described. In February 1988 I went to AID/W to present and defend the new
                    CDSS, which I had prepared containing this plan. Despite a good deal of pressure
                    at the meeting to eliminate one or two of the three elements, in favor of a
                    total concentration on the rice sector, the complete, balanced plan was
                    ultimately approved. Our Office received a clear policy mandate for the 1988-90
                    period to implement the three-legged program. As a consequence, later in 1988,
                    the Administrator again upgraded the Office another notch to a full USAID
                    Mission. This took effect just after my departure from Antan in July.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big a Mission was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: In my view the Mission grew too big after my departure, and this
                    disappointed me. I believe we had a chance to establish a new and better model
                    of doing business, but I think we blew it. I had thoroughly experienced a large
                    mission during my years in Dakar, where we had some 26 US Direct Hire officers,
                    plus contract Americans and Senegalese. I had regretted then how much time we
                    spent just on dealing with our own internal administration. I had often rued in
                    Senegal how difficult it was for me as the Program Officer to get out of the
                    office and into the field to see for myself what was going on. My experience in
                    the small office in Antan, by contrast, was liberating. I was able to travel to
                    every part of the large island, as REDSO encouraged me to do. Also in Antan,
                    dealing closely with the World Bank resident office, I saw how a large program
                    could be steered along by just a few good people, with plenty of help from
                    Washington. Of course, the AID system is constructed to give our Missions more
                    responsibility than the Bank's country offices have. I favor our system. But if
                    the most responsible people in our Missions have trouble getting out to see what
                    is going on, the purpose of our system is compromised. In Antan I was testing
                    just how much we in AID could do with the leanest resident staff possible. We
                    began in September 1984 with just two full-time professionals, Agnes and me, and
                    a driver. Three or four months later, REDSO contracted for the half-time
                    services of my wife, Julie Owen Rea. Julie was (and is) a direct hire career
                    officer. She had taken a leave of absence to accompany me to post, where there
                    was no established position apart from mine. Julie, who reported to REDSO,
                    turned out to be a life-saver. Her experience in preparing the implementation
                    (PIO) documents for the technical services, commodities and training under the
                    MARS project was just what we needed to start the program quickly. In addition,
                    we contracted locally with another American, Janet Crosthwaite, the wife of a
                    British officer in the European Development Fund (FED). Janet served as our
                    part-time administrative officer and received solid support and supervision from
                    our regional controller's office in Nairobi, as well as from the Executive
                    Officer in the Embassy, of which we were a part. The Embassy built an addition
                    and we took one floor for our offices, including space for our TDY visitors. In
                    the three years following, 1985-88, we added only one Direct Hire officer in
                    addition to myself, Donna Stauffer, one Malagasy professional, Gerard, and two
                    support peopla secretary and a second driver.</p>
                <p>In this way we grew from a total of four to a total of eight full time equivalent
                    (FTE) staff in 1988, including support staff. Our total annual program,
                    meanwhile, increased from $11 million in 1984 to $28 million by 1986. The
                    program leveled off at about this figure, not counting the counterpart funds
                    which we supervised. This, I think, was the lowest ratio of USDH staff to total
                    budget (OYB) in the Africa region. We could only do this, of course, thanks to
                    the outstanding support we received from REDSO and AID/W. But the ratio was a
                    bit too low, since the strain on REDSO and our office was showing. So before I
                    left, the Ambassador, then Patricia Gates Lynch, and I recommended the addition
                    of just two more Direct Hire officers: an economist to coordinate with the
                    IMF/World Bank/GDRM on structural adjustment, and an agriculturalist to track
                    our large sector program. I wrote the SPARS for these positions and worked with
                    an architect and builder to provide the necessary additional office space. All
                    was ready when I left.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>By 1988 I felt we had a solid program in Madagascar, both in content and in
                    staffing. Our Administrator apparently shared this view. In his annual March
                    budget request to the House Appropriations Committee, the Administrator
                    described the Madagascar program at length as a leading example of how AID
                    intended to use the new Development Fund for Africa which he was proposing. The
                    Congress accepted and passed the DFA into legislation that year. The DFA itself,
                    incidentally, was partially modeled on the Sahel Development Program.</p>
                <p>I believed ouMadagascar Office also provided a model for how a country program
                    could be structured and managed, to use a minimum oDirect Hire personnel
                    supplemented by local hire expatriates and host country nationals, and backed up
                    by a REDSO regional office and AID/W. Ambassador Lynch and I resisted as
                    strongly as we could a pell-mell increase in USDH staffing. We did so in the
                    interest of economy, security, and most of all, from my stand point, to free up
                    Direct Hire managers from a preoccupation with internal housekeeping so that
                    they could concentrate on the assistance program itself, outside the confines of
                    the office walls .</p>
                <p>But I'm sorry to say that we were overruled by AID regulations. These stipulated
                    that an AID Mission, once designated as such, must be staffed in a certain
                    prescribed manner, to include a Director, a Deputy Director, a Program Officer,
                    a Controller, a Management Officer, and so forth. As a result, I learned later
                    that the staff at AID/Madagascar mushroomed within a year or two. This growth,
                    in turn, required the arrangement of new and more spacious office facilities and
                    the securing of more official residences. I did not envy my successors,
                    especially in 1991, when the paralysis of the GDRM left them with a large staff
                    and premises and a partial suspension of our program activities, with little to
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Malagasy people in the government to
                        work with, compared to the Tanzanians and Senegalese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: The Malagasy were the most talented and, at the same time, the most
                    conflicted people of any I have worked with. I remember talking with a former
                    Executive Officer for the State Department, who made his living after retirement
                    by pinch-hitting in embassies all over Africa. He told me that of all the local
                    hire embassy staffs he knew in the African region, two stood head and shoulders
                    above the rest in hard work and competence: those in Ethiopia and Madagascar.
                    Agnes was an outstanding example of the intelligence and diligence of Malagasy
                    staff, but there were also others with whom we worked in the GDRM and the
                    Embassy who were remarkably disciplined and quick to learn.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>On the other hand, the proliferation of factions in Malagasy society along lines
                    of family cliques, ethnic groups, and political persuasions tended towards
                    gridlock, and the uncompromising toughness of the people made the gridlock
                    nearly intractable. At the same time, language also made it more difficult for
                    us. The fact that Malagasy all speak with each other in Malagasy, a language
                    which takes the American missionaries, for example, six years to learn,
                    separated us further, even if we were able to do reasonably well in French. And
                    certainly the insular island mentality and the suspicion the GDRM had of the
                    U.S., even among folks disposed to trust us personally, did not help. Despite
                    all this, we formed some very productive personal relationships with a few key
                    members of the GDRM, particularly in the Planning Ministry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Anything more on your experience there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: My four years in Madagascar, I feel sure, were the most instructive and, at
                    the same time, the most baffling of my career. I learned an enormous amount
                    about the operation of an AID program in the field and about our organization
                    itself in all its parts and people — from a field perspective. And I learned
                    this from soup to nuts, from the details of building an office and ordering
                    equipment up to all the things that went into and could go wrong with a
                    structural adjustment program. Learning-by-doing taught me a great deal. I was
                    also fortunate to be involved with some areas in which our Agency as a whole did
                    not have much experience: in working in Madagascar itself, of course, but also
                    in taking part in launching the first Food For Progress program, in the
                    auctioning (not just selling) of PL 480 imports for the first time, and in
                    organizing local community participation in environmental programs through
                    support to local and foreign PVOs. And, again, I can't stress too much the
                    marvelous support we received from Nairobi and Washington.</p>
                <p>But also it was in some ways a tortuous experience. We were dealing with a
                    government which had led its people in one direction and now was in the process
                    of renouncing its former principles to lead them back in the other direction,
                    like a person trying to go both ways at once in a revolving door. This, plus the
                    many conflicts within the Malagasy society, made for blockages and delays for no
                    apparent reason and even led to under-the-table dealings against the terms of
                    formal, signed agreements which we had reached with the GDRM. The President
                    regularly used the economic arm of his Party, for example, to import rice and
                    undercut the freeing up of the rice market. State production parastatals and the
                    State controlled banking community crowded out other market reforms and retarded
                    the growth of the private sector. Ratsiraka's leadership made for many
                    contradictions which came to a head several years after I left.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>What remains with me is the bizarre contrast between Madagascar's talented people
                    and well-watered countryside on the one hand and, on the other, the stark
                    poverty, desperation, even starvation of the poor, never far from view in town
                    or country. This standing contradiction was before the eyes of all of us who
                    worked there at that time. I was not reluctant to leave Madagascar by the time
                    our four year tour ended. And I was more than ready at that time in my career to
                    take a step back and try to form a larger view of our Agency and its worldwide
                    operations, and to gain an overview of the international development effort as a
                    whole.</p>

                    field. Though it was not my intention, my work for the Africa Bureau, except for
                    several months in 1994-95, was over. And for a combination of reasons, also
                    contrary to plan, I was to serve the last ten years of my AID career in
                    Washington.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REA: I came back to fill a brand new position as PPC's Assistant Budget Director.
                    My work began in August, 1988. Given my sense of fatigue at the time and my
                    desire to step back and see the big picture, it's apparent in retrospect that
                    this posting was providential. But it came about in an unexpected way.</p>
                <p>The assignment panel a year before had officially named me to be the director of
                    strategy development for the Africa Bureau, with an office in AFR/DP. My
                    supervisor-to-be, DP's Deputy Director, Jim Govan, had met me then in Nairobi
                    and had told me that my assignment was approved. But shortly after that, as I
                    learned later, the new Assistant Administrator for Africa, Chuck Gladson, read a
                    line in a cable I had written from Antan. He misinterpreted it to mean that I
                    opposed his prime policy, private sector development. Since Gladson had
                    apparently decided anyways that he wanted an economist for the job in which I
                    had been confirmed, he never bothered to say a word to me. Larry Saiers,
                    Gladson's Deputy AA, said that he was willing to lead an appeal to uphold my
                    assignment. But it was apparent to both of us that even if my protest prevailed,
                    Gladson would most likely refuse to work closely with me, to the detriment of
                    good forward planning. In any case, my replacement, Emmy Simmons, was an
                    excellent choice for the job. And (as I thought at the time) a short break from
                    Africa in the central Budget Officthe heart of Agency operationwas exactly what
                    I needed to gain the big picture perspective of AID operations which I very much
                    desired. But I must say, I was also disappointed at the way things had been

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your PPC job all about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Well, of course, the PPC Bureau did what its name implied. It served to
                    coordinate all of the Agency's policies and programs, and the budget office was
                    in the center of the action. Historically, PPC under a strong Administrator was
                    feared and respected, and often resented. The Bureau acted as the
                    Administrator's program office. PPC was his right arm in running the Agency and
                    enforcing policies which the Regional Bureaus, like Africa, did not always
                    believe applied to them. So for me to move from the field to Washington, and
                    from AFR to PPC, required a total readjustment. But it was one I welcomed, for
                    as a vantage point on AID's policy and practice worldwide, there was no better
                    place to work than the office I now joined, PPC/PB, planning and budget.</p>
                <p>PB was then directed by George Hill, a sharp, experienced foreign service
                    officer, and his exemplary deputy, Jim Painter, a GS officer. The office was
                    divided into two equal parts of about 15 persons each. The branch I headed was
                    responsible for the coordination and analysis of Agency programs in all the
                    separate bureaus. The other branch, led by Ken Milow, dealt with the allocation
                    of the budget, a very technical and painstaking line of work. My section had the
                    job of making sure that the Administrator's policies were understood and
                    implemented by the rest of the Agency, and my people were known as the
                    “coordinators”. Each of them was assigned to cover one or more Bureaus. They did
                    so principally by working with the Director of the DP Office and his or her
                    staff in the Bureau(s) which they were assigned to cover, and by attending their
                    weekly staff meetings and all their budget and project reviews.</p>
                <p>Before the new position which I was selected to fill was created a few months
                    before, the coordinators had all dealt directly with George and/or Jim. This
                    causeJim a severe span of control problem, since he had to supervise both
                    divisions, and especially since he had to deal with the seven chief
                    coordinators, some of whom had deputies. Although my new position made sense on
                    paper, in practicgiven the high velocity budget process and the need of the
                    coordinators to get instant decisions from Jim and GeorgI quickly saw that I was
                    in danger of creating a new layer of bureaucracy between the front office and
                    the coordinators, and might end up doing more harm than good.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REA: Exactly. And these were first rate people, several of whom went on quickly
                    to become Mission Directors, as Mike Rugh did when he left us to direct
                    USAID/Somalia. The coordinators did not require much supervision. I did my best
                    to be helpful to Jim without getting in the way, but I did not think that what I
                    did justified the salary I was paid. I certainly learned a great amount about
                    the budget process and about the work of the Agency, but what I was able to do,
                    in my view, was of marginal utility.</p>

                </p>
                <p>REA: I came to know PPC quite well, with all its various offices and people. I
                    was invited to sit in on the weekly senior staff meetings led by our Assistant
                    Administrator, Rich Bissell. These meetings were attended by George Hill and the
                    other heads of office. We met in a distinguished old paneled room to hear each
                    of them report, usually in very abbreviated form, on the latest news regarding
                    whatever hot topic with which he or she was dealing. It was like a weekly
                    state-of-the-Agency bulletin in short-hand, since they used acronyms and the
                    latest terms and expressions wherever possible. It took me months to figure out
                    all they were saying. But I was impressed at every meeting by the wide range of
                    issues involved, all the way from the state of legislation on the Hill down to
                    niggling operational problems affecting the Agency as a whole.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any major policy interests or areas that you
                        were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: The 18 months I spent in PPAugust 1988 to February 199was an elating,
                    watershed period in the outside world, with Bush's election and the fall of the
                    Berlin Wall. But it was a tough time in AID, particularly in PPC. Our able young
                    Administrator, Allan Woods, after only a short time on the job, died slowly of
                    cancer, leaving an inevitable vacuum of leadership. This coincided with an
                    effort which had begun before Woods, to decentralize the Agency and to give more
                    authority to the Regional Bureaus. Many questions went unresolved. Outside the
                    Agency, there was a bigger than usual public debate going on about the mission
                    of AID, particularly with regard to the private sector's role in development.
                    Inside the Agency, decentralization had already eroded the authority oPPC, and
                    the Bureau's authority was further weakened by the absence of the
                    Administrator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any particular policy interests being pushed at
                        that time or was it just chaos?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>REA: “Chaos,” never. Congress micro-manages the AID budget too closely, and our
                    budget process with the inspectors from the Office of Management and Budget is
                    too other-directed to allow for chaos. “Soul-searching” would be a more accurate
                    description of PPC, if not the Agency as a whole, at the time. The Bureau held a
                    retreat at Airlie House in Virginia for a couple of days in September, 1988. Two
                    topics were paramount. The chief question we discussed was this: after agreeing
                    that AID's overall goal was “broad-based sustainable economic growth,” just what
                    were the Agency's priorities? Some political appointees of the new Bush
                    administration believed strongly that private sector development should lead the
                    rest. And the second big question we faced was how to restructure the Agency.
                    These two issues underlay strenuous attempts in the months that followed to
                    redraft our basic legislation, the Foreign Assistance Act, an effort in which
                    George Hill was heavily involved. But unfortunately, all this work came to very
                    little. The fact that the foreign aid budget dropped off precipitously in the
                    1990-95 period fueled even more controversy over priorities.</p>

                <p>Provides Leadership in Education Program Developmen1990-1994</p>
                <p>REA: Yes, and in accord with my recommendation I was not replaced in PPC/PB until
                    my job was reconfigured sometime later. My plan all along, as I had shared with
                    George and Jim, was to move back to the field in Africa during the summer of
                    1990. But in June 1989 and again that Fall I ran into a health problem which put
                    our overseas ventures on hold for the 1990 assignment cycle. There were no
                    opportunities for me in the Africa Bureau in Washington, and I didn't feel very
                    useful staying on in PB. So I was wondering: what to do?</p>
                <p>Just at this time in late 1989, I began to get frequent calls from a former
                    colleague, Antonio Gayoso, who was now the Agency Director for Human Resources
                    in the Science and Technology Bureau (S&amp;T). It happened that a dozen years
                    before, when I was preparing the human resources development plan for the Sahel,
                    Tony had been my key clearance contact for AFR/DR and so had known all about our
                    Sahel strategy. Tony now was very anxious to find someone, preferably a foreign
                    service officer, to head the Office of Education (one of the two offices he
                    supervised), which had gone without a confirmed Director for all of 1989.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>I was initially cautious about moving to S&amp;T. After a year in AID/W, I knew
                    that the Bureau's reputation was, shall we say, mixed. Especially at a time of
                    declining Agency budgets, rival bureaus like PPC and AFR perceived S&amp;T as
                    too big and bloated. From a field perspective, since few of the staff at S&amp;T
                    were foreign service officers, that Bureau was often perceived as rather
                    academic and other-worldly. I had a more positive view of the Bureau than some
                    because the excellent support S&amp;T had given us in Madagascar was still fresh
                    in my mind. It didn't take mlong to see that at a time when all the doors were
                    shut for me to work directly with Africa — the geographic region I believed most
                    needed our support — now at least I was being given a chance to reconnect with
                    the technical area which, I thought, delivered the support most needed.</p>
                <p>By then in late 1989 it was known that Rich Bissell, whom I had come to like and
                    admire, was leaving PPC to become the new Assistant Administrator of
                    S&amp;sometime in the Spring. Before accepting Tony's offer, I made doubly sure
                    through Brad Langmaid, the Bureau's veteraDeputy AA, that Rich personally wanted
                    me, and not someone else, to direct the Education Office. This confirmed, I
                    accepted Tony's invitation. My first day in my new job was February 12,
                    1990.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your function there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: S&amp;T/ED, as it was known thethe Bureau's name changed from Science and
                    Technology to Research and Development (R&amp;D) soon after, and I'll be using
                    the two names somewhat interchangeablthe Education Office was the smallest of
                    the Bureau's eight technical offices. It seemed to me that we were the smallest
                    office with the most to do and the farthest to go. This was because,
                    regrettably, the Agency had left education in comparative neglect after the
                    1960s, despite the fact that education was essential to sustainable programs and
                    to development of any kind. The Agency's large contribution to education in the
                    Sixties had concentrated on developing post-secondary institutions, as we had
                    done in Tanzania, for example. In the Seventies, when we turned our emphasis
                    towards the rural poor, AID allowed formal education to languish, and turned to
                    literacy. Part of the reason for this neglect of the schools, as I knew too well
                    myself from Senegal and the Sahel, was due to the fact that the countries with
                    whom we worked were themselves not yet ready to reform their school systems with
                    the degree of commitment required. Not until the mid-1980s did AID begin to give
                    basic education the attention it deserved.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>Whatever the reasons, there was now much to be done. A hiring freeze meant that
                    we werpermitted to fill only 7.8 out of ten of the full time equivalent (FTE)
                    positions approved for our office. This included two administrative assistants
                    which we later reduced to one, our indomitable Barbara Adams. The Office managed
                    a dozen middle-aged to old projects. We had responsibility for an annual budget
                    of about $15 million, which included our core budget of $6 million plus $9
                    million provided by the Regional Bureaus to pay for the services which our
                    projects provided them.</p>
                <p>On the face of it, compared to the ratio of staff to budget which we achieved in
                    Madagascar, it is easy to see why a Regional Bureau might have thought
                    S&amp;T/ED was over-staffed. But it was immediately clear to me that our job was
                    much more than directing a few central projects. Our larger responsibility was
                    to anticipate the kind of expertise our Regional Bureaus and field missions
                    would require two or three years ahead, and then to devise projects and to
                    support coalitions which would be necessary to meet these needs. At the time I
                    arrived in S&amp;T/ED in February 1990, we had good reason to believe that the
                    Agency's requirements in education would be growing and changing in exciting
                    ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: There were two sides to the overall situation, the domestic and the
                    international. You'll recall that here in the U.S. concern had been building
                    throughout the 1980's about the “second-rate” quality of education which our
                    children were subjected to, compared with, say, German and Japanese children.
                    Leading voices in our business community especially became more insistent that
                    our young people were too poorly educated to meet the growing fierce challenge
                    of international competition. This insistence was swept up into national
                    politics by the end of the decade. In the Fall of 1989, you'll remember, the
                    National Governors' Association, featuring Bill Clinton, met with President Bush
                    in the “education summit” at Charlottesville, Va. Out of this meeting came the
                    Ten Goals, which evolved into the “Education 2000” legislation under the Clinton
                    Administration several years later.</p>
                <p>At the same time, this domestic fervor for education reform was reflected in U.S.
                    foreign assistance. At the insistence of Senator Hatfield and a few members on
                    the House side, the Congress in 1988 wrote an earmark into our aid appropriation
                    to require the Agency to work harder to improve basic education. In actual fact,
                    the education reform movement had affected our program even earlier than this.
                    Hoping to avoid the earmark, AID had begun to pick up the pace two years before
                    on its own, but the Congress insisted we do even more. As a result, every year
                    since 1988 the Agency has had to obligate some $130 million (the 1990-94
                    average) for “basic education” programs, two-thirds of them in Sub-Saharan
                    Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>That was the domestic situation. Internationally, interest was also on the rise
                    for education, or more exactly, for “basic” education. This term refers, for the
                    most part, to primary school systems, although our Congressional earmark
                    expanded the intent in the early 1990s to include early childhood education and
                    literacy training, among other things. In any case, interest in education was
                    surging abroad for the same main reason as it was here at hominternational
                    competition.</p>
                <p>Stepping back into the HRD field after about ten years away, I was struck by the
                    change. It was clear that a consensus had finally coalesced around solid
                    evidence, based on years of investigation. General agreement was emerging that
                    sound basic education is the foundation for sustained success in a range of
                    areas: family planning, child health, farmer productivity, and the extension of
                    pluralist systems, just to name the fields where the evidence was strongest.
                    Particularly influential, I think, were the reports oeconomists who had studied
                    the causes for the rapid risof the “Asian Tigers”. These reports all underscored
                    the finding that the steps the “Tigers” had taken to invest in basic education
                    had been even more decisive than their investment in higher education. Other
                    studiein areas of Nigeria, for example — demonstrated the remarkable degree to
                    which an effective basic education program served to enhance the success of
                    other sector specific programs, such as child health and on-farm production.
                    Frequently cited at the time was the conclusion written by Larry Summers in his
                    role as Chief Economist at the World Bank, summarizing a multi-year study by the
                    Bank, that “educating girls quite likely yields a higher rate of return than any
                    other investment available in the developing world.”</p>
                <p>Acting on all this evidence, the World Bank along with UNICEF and UNESCO
                    organized an extraordinary conference which took place in Jomtien, Thailand in
                    March, 1990. This World Conference on Education for All (WCEFA) was the first of
                    the series of world conventions which marked the 1990-96 period. The Education
                    Conference was followed, and its conclusions reaffirmed, by the Environment
                    Conference in Rio (1992), the Population Conference in Cairo (1994), and the
                    conferences in Beijing on women and in Denmark on social development, both in
                    1995. The World Food Conference followed in 1996. World Conference fatigue set
                    in after that, but WCEFA was the first of the remarkable series. The Education
                    for All conference drew minister-level representation from 150 countries, rich
                    and poor. Significantly, the official delegations were matched by an even
                    greater number of private organizations, and these were given an equal voice
                    with the officiala first for international conferences and replicated at those
                    which followed.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>The U.S. played a big supporting role in WCEFA. AID was the first bilateral donor
                    organization to co-sponsor the conference. The American delegation was led by
                    Gov. Tom Kean of New Jersey, one of the leading governors for education reform
                    in this period. The Department of Education sent representatives, along with a
                    host of groups in the public and private sectors. AID sent three reps, including
                    Cliff Block from S&amp;T/ED who had been the Acting Director of the Office
                    throughout 1989, and Frank Method from PPC, who joined our office after Cliff
                    retired in 1991. As a late-comer to the field, I did not ask to go to Jomtien
                    since the number orepresentatives AID could send was strictly limited and my
                    colleagues had made the preparations.</p>
                <p>After days of meeting, the Jomtien Conference set two main goals: first, that by
                    the year 2000, 80% of all children would receive an acceptable level of
                    education and, second, that by the same year adult illiteracy would be cut in
                    half. Six months later, in September, 1980, these goals were ratified by the
                    world's Heads of State, including President Bush, who came together in New York
                    at the event called the World Summit for Children.</p>
                <p>With all this, I considered that S&amp;T/ED had received its mandate. Our task,
                    as my colleagues and I saw it, was to tap into this surge of public support for
                    basic education, at home and abroad, and to devise ways for the Agency to use
                    the basic education earmark for maximum effect. As Director of the Office, but
                    not a career specialist in education myself, my role as I saw it was to do what
                    a program officea good generaliscould do best: to ensure that we kept our eyes
                    on the big picture of opportunity, that we set priorities in a collegial way to
                    guide our work, and that we worked out a rational, well-organized approach which
                    could be easily understood by all the people inside and outside AID with whom
                    our Office would need to work to meet our goals. I should add, that my four
                    years in the education trenches, two with the Sahel program at home and two
                    abroad in Tanzania, were very important for guiding my generalist instincts at
                    S&amp;T/ED.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of projects were you using?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Our Office managed two categories of projects. The first, which took the
                    bulk of our time and attention, were projects designed to improve basic
                    education systems. I stress basic ed because until 1994, when we created the
                    Human Resources Development Center, S&amp;T/ED was distinct and separate from
                    the Bureau's University Center, which handled higher education. Our Office's
                    second category of projects had to do with that interesting field known as
                    “development communication”. This involved the application of behavioral science
                    and social marketing techniqueMadison Avenue kinds of expertisto areas of
                    special concern for development. A successful example of this had been the joint
                    project we had done with S&amp;T/Health to help countries design campaigns to
                    induce mothers to use oral rehydration therapy (ORT) techniques for children who
                    were suffering and in danger of dying from severe diarrhea.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>But your question is to the kinds of projects we designed and managed within
                    these two broad categories. Before answering, I need to explain that our
                    so-called “central” projects (as contrasted with the activities which our
                    regional bureaus were responsible for) all had to meet one key test. S&amp;T
                    projects had to offer services which the regional bureaus were willing to pay
                    for from the accounts allocated to them. The funds allocated directly to us,
                    S&amp;T/ED's core funds, only went far enough to design the projects and to pay
                    the costs which a contractor charged for maintaining an office and a minimum
                    staff. After that, we depended on our Regional Bureaus and our country Missions
                    to “buy in” to our projects to pay the actual costs of the services which the
                    contractor provided them. This is the system I was referring to when I said that
                    S&amp;T/ED's annual budget was about $6 million in “core” funds an$9 million in
                    “buy-in” funds.</p>
                <p>In order to make sure that we and the other S&amp;T technical offices did not
                    waste monedesigning and managing projects which the regional bureaus would not
                    use, the Agency introduced a rating system in the early Nineties which required
                    the regional bureaus to rank each of our projects each year. Those projects not
                    considered “important” did not receive fundinit was as simple as that. Ialmost
                    went without saying that unless our projects offered exceptional expertise of a
                    kind that an individual mission might have difficulty contracting for itself, we
                    would not get their business and our projects would fold. This requirement
                    generally meant that we had to succeed in connecting the Agency with areas in
                    which the U.S. had acknowledged leadership. We had to tap those sources in which
                    U.S. expertise was considered world class.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this affect the education area? I recall during
                        McPherson's time in the mid-Eighties that the view was hostile toward doing
                        anything in education. The opinion was that the U.S. had no competence in
                        this area. We had nothing to offer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Right. And this was the same perception — the poor quality of our schools —
                    that fueled the U.S. education reform movement which we've spoken about. It took
                    a huge, broadbrush emotional appeal to galvanize the country's support for
                    reform, and this distorted the true picture. When the experts stopped to examine
                    the problem and to look at the different parts of our 50 state system more
                    closely, it became apparent that our most important deficiencies were at the
                    secondary school level. The research showed that when they emerged from primary
                    school, U.S. students compared favorably with our world competitors. Where our
                    students fell behind was in the secondary system, grades 7-12. Even if this had
                    not been the case generally, however, the U.S. education system was so
                    diversified that it was easy to find shining exceptions to the general average.
                    It has been from these “best practices” that the U.S. education reform movement,
                    as well as our AID program in basic education, has drawn its life.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>Nevertheless, you are perfectly correct that reservations did persist in AID/W
                    from the Hanna era through McPherson's about AID's role in primary education,
                    though not always for the same reasons. Our field missions, as well, were often
                    reluctant to engage in formal schooling, as I knew from my own experience. All
                    these doubts notwithstanding, I was pleased to find thaS&amp;T/ED had been able
                    to do some pioneering work in primary education during the 1980s, particularly
                    in two fields.</p>
                <p>The first of these fields might be labeled “technology,” although it went a good
                    deal further than that. Our Education Office had been a leader in developing a
                    technique for using radio in the classroom to reinforce the role of teachers,
                    particularly in language and math instruction. This so-called “Interactive Radio
                    Instruction” (IRI) technique required very carefully scripted lessons, which
                    posed questions and left time in the transmission for students to provide
                    answers as each lesson progressed, thus “interactive”. Once teachers learned
                    that the radio programs were designed to help, and not replace, them, teachers
                    used IRI to stimulate their pupils, who usually had become accustomed to passive
                    rote learning. Students in the IRI English classes I observed in the
                    Johannesburg area during my visit there in 1993, for example, were highly
                    enthusiastic.</p>
                <p>By the early 1990s AID had helped establish these interactive radio education
                    programs in perhaps a dozen countries, as diverse as Papua New Guinea and Costa
                    Rica. Cliff Block and Jim Hoxeng in S&amp;T/ED were among the most knowledgeable
                    people on earth in this field. What was more, the Office had funded a small
                    documentation center to keep track of the experience which we and others had
                    accumulated in using the technique. Other donors including the World Bank,
                    UNESCO, and some of the bilateral agencies were picking up on IRI and funding
                    these programs themselves. According to one report, “IRI yielded the largest and
                    most cost-effective gains of any (education) intervention in the developing
                    world.” For various reasons, IRI is still underutilized. The programs must be
                    prepared with painstaking care. But IRI has great potential.</p>
                <p>S&amp;T/ED had made a solid contribution to basic education in a second area, as
                    well, more important than the first. This was the development of a systems
                    approach to the design and management of primary and secondary school programs.
                    At the heart othe systems approach was the so-called EMIS, the education
                    management information system. This enabled managers to keep up-to-date
                    information on all elements oa school system: teachers, students, materials,
                    buildings, budgets and the state of readiness of these components. The EMIS
                    could be computerized, but did not have to be. The essential thing was that the
                    EMIS represented a way of looking at and monitoring a collection of education
                    components as an interrelated system.</p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>As of 1990, S&amp;T/ED had over a decade of experience in combining EMIS together
                    with monitoring and evaluation systems, and operational research. The Office had
                    helped Regional Bureaus to plan and manage large education sector programs in
                    Indonesia, Egypt, Pakistan, El Salvador and a host of smaller countries like
                    Somalia and Liberia. Florida State University, the chief contractor for our IEES
                    project (Improving the Efficiency of Education Systems), was pulling together
                    the lessons they had learned in designing education systems in a dozen
                    countries. Meanwhile, Harvard University, chief contractor for our BRIDGES
                    project, had developed an outstanding series of training modules for education
                    planners, also based on the systems approach. Thanks to these two activities, we
                    not only had valuable experience ready to use and share in reforming primary
                    education systems, but we also had the means of teaching the experience to
                    education planneras more and more countries became seriously interested in
                    improving their basic education programs.</p>
                <p>So our Office had a good track record built up through the years oFront Office
                    scepticism and the reserve on the part of some (but by no means all) of our
                    Missions. Thanks in large measure to the Congressional earmark, AID by 1990 was
                    the world's largest bilateral donor in basic education. We managed programs in
                    some 24 countries. Whether our Agency's leadership liked it or not, the basic
                    education program in S&amp;T and the Regional Bureaus had a solid mandate — read
                    “earmark” — from the Hill. And momentum was building to do even more. The U.S.
                    delegation, and AID in particular, had played a very constructive role at the
                    World Conference in Jomtien. Domestic energies for education reform were high.
                    As good fortune would have it, I felt I had become the Director of S&amp;T/ED at
                    the best possible time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do specifically?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Specifically? Since we'll be talking about a period of over four years,
                    February 1990 until May 1994, I'll try to stick to the main lines of what we
                    were doing. I'll have to skip lots of names and details, I'm afraid, to keep
                    this account within a reasonable compass.</p>
                <p>The most important thing I thought we had to do to catch the winds of education
                    reform in the U.S. was to keep together the coalition which had prepared the
                    U.S. participation in the Jomtien Conference. This group of public and private
                    organizations had played a large hand in setting the two goals set by the World
                    Education Conference which we've talked about: 80% of the world's children to
                    receive an acceptable level of education, and adult illiteracy to be cut in
                    halboth by the year 2000. These goals were vague and the timing improbable, it's
                    true, but they helped us in R&amp;D/ED to see where we needed to adjust our
                    program. This was especially true when we took these goals in conjunction with
                    three other outcomes of the World Conference. We knew we would need outside
                    partners if we were to make satisfactory progress in the directions agreed
                    upon.</p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>The first of these three other outcomes at Jomtien was the general agreement
                    among the confereethat those countries most in need of education progress would,
                    with donor assistance, as required, develop “national plans of action” to reform
                    their education systems. As I've said, we at AID had some extensive experience
                    in designing and managing primary school systems and we had developed some
                    excellent tools, even though we knew we had a lot more to learn from partners
                    involved in our own domestic reform movement. Second, the conferees at Jomtien
                    also generally agreed that basic education systems should take account (somehow)
                    of what was needed to prepare children for school in the first place, including
                    health and nutrition elements. “Early childhood development” was of great
                    interest to various private voluntary organizations, especially. We knew that
                    improvement in this area would depend primarily on the PVOs, since governments
                    already had their hands full with improving the schools themselves.</p>
                <p>The third area which received great support at Jomtien went beyond improving
                    school systems merely by achieving better efficiency and wider access. The
                    quality of education provided in the schools was also of greater interest than
                    ever before. The conferees understood that unless the learning that went on
                    within the schools improved, universal literacy and numeracy would forever
                    remain beyond reach. In fact, it was by then the experience of many countries
                    that where schools were ineffective, students dropped out and enrollments
                    declined. Thus, improved quality and wider access were linked. Finding ways to
                    improve the quality of basic education was another area, we believed, in which
                    collaboration with partners which were part of the U.S. education reform
                    movement could help us in an important way.</p>
                <p>So, in answer to your question, here are some specifics on what we did.</p>
                <p>First, to tap into the domestic reform energies, S&amp;T/ED became the major
                    source of support for the network which had served to bring public and private
                    organizations together to prepare for, and represent the U.S. at, the Jomtien
                    conference. This network was USCEFA, the U.S. Coalition for Education for All.
                    Our purpose in helping to keep this coalition together, and encouraging it grow,
                    was to assist the Agency in developing the most appropriate agenda in basic
                    education and to provide us with strong partners for public-private programs in
                    this area. We hoped to be as successful as S&amp;T/Health, which had helped to
                    form a similar coalition ten years before, with outstanding benefits for the
                    Agency's health programs.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>Let me illustrate for you what USCEFA was capable of doing. The Coalition's first
                    annual conference following Jomtien took place in Alexandria, Virginia on
                    October 3November 1, 1991. The theme was “Learning for All: Bridging Domestic
                    and International Education.” Panels were formed to discuss three themes:
                    restructuring basic education, launching early childhood development, and
                    mobilizing the media. Barbara Bush accepted to be the honorary Chairperson. Jim
                    Grant, Director of UNICEF, served as the keynote speaker. Al Shanker of the
                    American Federation of Teachers gave a lunchtime address. David Kearns othe
                    Xerox Corporation, one of the business community's strongest voices for
                    education reform, also spoke. Elena Lanskaya, the leading figure of Russia's
                    Ministry of Education, was an outstanding participant. Over 300 peoplattended
                    from 28 countries. USCEFA's Board of Directors included business groups like
                    Apple Computer, PVOs like Save the Children, and leading NGO organizations like
                    the Academy for Educational Development (represented by its President and CEO,
                    Steve Moseley) and the Education Development Center (represented by its
                    President, Janet Whitla).</p>
                <p>While R&amp;D/ED was the major funder of USCEFA and of this conference, we took
                    pains to keep a low profile and we limited our funding to cover only essential
                    core costs. We did this for two reasons. First and foremost, we wanted to
                    encourage the organization to take off on its own. The other side of this was
                    our very proper apprehension that should USCEFA become AID-dependent, it would
                    be perceived as a self-serving lobbying group on behalf of our basic education
                    earmark. USCEFA held two more major conferences and did some groundbreaking work
                    on the applications to development of mass media and education.</p>
                <p>After I left, in 1996, USCEFA disbanded and, with no AID support, some 60 NGOs
                    led by AED and EDC formed the International Education and Training Coalition, an
                    advocacy group for increased U.S. assistance to education in developing
                    countries. Despite the change of character, the Coalition still serves some of
                    the purpose for which USCEFA was created. I was delighted to hear that the group
                    was represented at the meeting called recently by the National Security Council
                    to help shape President Clinton's education initiative for Africa.</p>
                <p>A second specific thing we did was to design a new project, “Improving
                    Educational Quality,” to address the widespread concern expressed at Jomtien
                    that primary schools must engender better learning. Cliff Block led this design
                    effort before he retired from AID in September 1991. The IEQ project, which
                    straight off became active in Central America and Africa, sought to improve the
                    quality of basic education in three ways.</p>
                <p>First and foremost, IEQ worked to prepare host countries with the capacity to
                    assess the progress of learning at the classroom level and to estimate the
                    comparative effectiveness on increased student learning of new initiatives which
                    these countries might undertake, such as curriculum reform or teacher
                    training.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>Second, to assist with this, the project was designed to provide matching funds
                    to encourage select institutions from the U.S. Department of Education's
                    Regional Centers and Labs to work directly with our host country partners on
                    ways of improving learning in their classrooms. I must say, however, that as
                    promising as this approach may be for the future, this element of the project
                    was unsuccessful. In part, this was because the interests of the premier U.S.
                    education research organizations and those of the majority of AID's host
                    countries did not match up sufficiently well for our Centers and Labs to justify
                    their part of the expense involved. But a larger part of the reason was that,
                    somehow, AID's share of the funding for this portion of the project never made
                    it through the IEQ approval/contracting process.</p>
                <p>Third, and this was more successful, IEQ provided funding for initiatives,
                    largely if not entirely through PVOs, in favor of early childhood education.
                    This became an important element of the IEQ project in South Africa, where
                    strong local PVOs abound. As intended, this portion of the project was given a
                    boost by our national success with the Headstart program. Richard Pelczar, a
                    professional educator who worked on our staff as an administrative appointee
                    until he left for a position with the Inter-American Development Bank, guided
                    the early stages of our work in the early childhood area. Then, when Frank
                    Method moved over to our Office from PPC after Cliff and Richard had departed,
                    he brought to the management of the IEQ project his years of experience as one
                    of the international development pioneers in the field of early childhood
                    development.</p>
                <p>Still with the intent to open our doors and windows more widely to the currents
                    of education reform, and to complement what we were doing in this regard through
                    USCEFA and the IEQ project, we negotiated a time-sharing arrangement with the
                    U.S. Department of Education (USED) for the part-time services of one of their
                    senior officers who had special experience in international education. Bob
                    Leestma attended our weekly staff meetings and took on special assignments for
                    us. He represented an effort by both sides to build a partnership which would
                    outlast our work together in preparation for the Jomtien conference. But again,
                    as we found with USED's Regional Centers and Labs, despite Bob's best efforts,
                    the primary interests of USED did not coincide closely enough with R&amp;D/ED's
                    to make a lasting relationship worthwhile at that time.</p>
                <p>Much closer and more valuable to our thinking, however, was the twice-yearly
                    conference we initiated with UNICEF's education office under the leadership of
                    Aklilu Habte. We also kept up our regular meetings with the World Bank and,
                    annually, with a special group of the leading thinkers on basic education, drawn
                    from the major bilateral and multilateral donors. Frank Method represented our
                    office, and the Agency, on this group.</p>
                <p>None of this, I'm confident in saying, was collaboration for its own sake. Our
                    Regional Bureaus, with their ability to cut off their funding if they did not
                    find our projects sufficiently useful to them, constantly kept our attention on
                    where it should be: on results in the field.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>So that we could respond more effectively to the field'requests for services, we
                    streamlined our management to some degree. We simplified our project portfolio
                    over time, reducing the number of projects we managed from twelve to six. We
                    combined into a single ongoing project, ABEL, the lessons we had learned about
                    designing more efficient education systems, along with the teaching modules we
                    had developed to train planners in designing better systems. ABEL was intended
                    to make use of and disseminate these products. Mainly, the project prepared and
                    provided teams to design new basic education activities for AID worldwide.
                    Africa was the largest beneficiary of this activity.</p>
                <p>At Jomtien, as I mentioned before, countries had agreed to design “national
                    action plans” for basic ed, with donor assistance where needed. To this end,
                    both just before and after Jomtien, R&amp;D/ED helpeour Africa Bureau design new
                    country programs in Mali, Guinea (Conakry), Ghana, Benin, South Africa, Uganda,
                    Ethiopia, Malawi and elsewhere. In 1990, the Africa Bureau, particularly,
                    adopted the “non-project assistance,” or NPA, style of programming. In the
                    education area, NPA lent itself perfectly to the systems approach which we in
                    R&amp;D/ED had developed and had now concentrated under ABEL. The education
                    management information system (EMIS), which was at the core of our sector
                    approach, was especially suited to NPA, since the information system helped
                    provide a means of tracking U.S. block grant funding.</p>
                <p>Jim Hoxeng, who was particularly known for his ability to collaborate closely
                    with the field, directed ABEL. Jim also brought to this project his special
                    interest in non-formal education. Based on successful experience he had had in
                    Ecuador and Lesotho, Jim devised a method for creating self-supporting “service
                    agencies” in host countries. These were fee-charging agencies which could
                    contract with local PVOs and public institutions to train their members to carry
                    out non-formal education activities, especially literacy programs, at the
                    grassroots level. We tucked funding into ABEL for creating service agencies. In
                    other ways we funded a link to the U.S. Center for Literacy at the University of
                    Pennsylvania whose director, Dan Wagner, had personal experience and interest in
                    Africa.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>Our purpose in both actions was to give the Agency the capability to design and
                    carry out literacy programs at the request of our host countries, and in
                    response to the new mandate from Congress. Following Jomtien, the Hill expanded
                    our earmark's definition of basic education, making literacy and early childhood
                    education specific elements. So by adding a capability to design early childhood
                    and literacy programs to our already well-practiced approach to designing more
                    efficient education systems, we were in a strong position to respond to the
                    field. This new capability, at the same time, enabled the Agency to meet the
                    full requirements of the Congress's basic educatioearmark and to support fully
                    the Jomtien resolutions which President Bush had publicly and officially
                    supported at the Child Summit in September, 1990.Since the Agency was
                    accountable to the Congress for making progress in meeting the mandate of the
                    basic education earmark, which had been with us each year since 1988, I was
                    concerned that at any time the Hill might ask us what we had done with well over
                    half a billion dollars which they had appropriated for this purpose. It also
                    seemed to me that we should provide the answer before it was asked. But related
                    to that, I felt at the time I came into S&amp;T/ED — later renamed, R&amp;D/ED —
                    that the Agency needed some set of guidelines to help the Agency, both in the
                    field and in Washington, to determine which countries we should assist in
                    education and to help us decide on the most effective use of our education funds
                    in those countries. Later, it appeared to me appropriate to combine the two
                    concerns and to include the guidelines in the report to Congress.</p>
                <p>I discussed this idea with Rich Bissell, who concurred. Each month I had been
                    convening an Education Sector Council to bring R&amp;D/ED together with the
                    chief education officers from the rest of the Agency. Parenthetically, the
                    education officer representing the Africa Bureau on the Council was Julie Owen
                    Rea, who had been serving as only one of two education officers in AFR since our
                    return from Madagascar in 1988. With the full participation of the Council
                    members we issued a report entitled “AID's Investment in Basic Education”. This
                    first appeared in January 1993, with a second printing in May to improve the
                    reproduction of the photographs. We distributed the report widely, to the Hill,
                    throughout the Agency in Washington and the field, to our USCEFA partners and
                    among the other donors.</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>Prepared principally by Ash Hartwell through a contract with AED, the report
                    under my supervision developed an approach initiated earlier by Frank Method
                    before he moved from PPC to our Office in 1992. The paper grouped the developing
                    countries in a matrix format, ranked by quantitative need (high, medium, and
                    low) and by policy environment (favorable, possible, and unfavorable). The
                    report demonstrated that of the eight countries cited in the world which
                    maintained both a high level of need and a favorable policy environment, AID
                    education programs were already at work in six. The report further showed that
                    fully 70% oAID's basic education funds were invested in 13 of the 41 “Low Income
                    Countries” classified by the World Bank as having an annual per capita GNP below
                    $640.The report served two principal audiences, AID and the Congress. The main
                    purpose of the document was to guide the Agency in improving our allocation of
                    basic ed funds to the truly neediest, best risk countries. We were already not
                    doing badly with that. But whether or not our paper influenced the Regional
                    Bureaus in the programming of future funds, the report apparently did meet its
                    secondary purpose. At a minimum, it served to satisfy the Congress enough to
                    stave off any hostile questioning, at least until the time I left a year and a
                    half later.</p>
                <p>It was good to have a kit full of tools and a clear idea of the job we had to do.
                    But without the skilled direct hire professionals we needed to guide and direct
                    the Agency's work in education, we knew we would be in trouble sooner or later,
                    no matter how many contract employees we might be able to employ to carry out
                    the work. I was very concerned that our direct hire ranks were thinning rapidly,
                    as old pros like Cliff Block retired and the hiring of younger officers to
                    replace them was frozen.</p>
                <p>For this reason we cooperated closely with the Workforce Planning Group which the
                    Management Bureau formed under John Hummon's direction in 1991-92. The purpose
                    of the Group was to give AID Senior Management the clearest possible picture of
                    what the Agency's staffing needs would be to direct AID's programs in the coming
                    years. John's group asked us for our estimates in the education (Backstop 60)
                    area. We projected the number of trained education officers who would be needed
                    at home and in the field to supervise our growing number of programs, then
                    subtracted the number of officers who could be expected to retire or switch to
                    other professional areas.</p>
                <p>After consultations with our colleagues in the Education Sector Council over an
                    extended period and using the best information the Agency had available, we
                    reported to the Hummon task force that AID's cadre of direct hire education
                    officers was declining rapidly. Five excellent mid-career officers had been
                    brought on board in 1990 before the hiring freeze took effect. All five were
                    assigned to the new education programs starting up in Africa at the time. This
                    was a step in the right direction. But according to our estimates, the Agency's
                    education portfolio would be severely understaffed by the end of the decade. It
                    was imperative, we declared, that new officers should be recruited and trained,
                    beginning pronto.</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>The Workforce Planning Group made formal recommendations which incorporated our
                    findings in 1992. But after three interns were recruited, the Agency took no
                    further action. In fact, to make matters even worse, the notorious Reduction In
                    Force (RIF) which occurred in 1996 affected the education cadre
                    disproportionately. Education lost 35% of its remaining BS-60 officers,
                    including all five of the mid-career officers inducted in 1990 and serving in
                    Africa, in spite of the fact that the education earmark was still firmly in
                    place. By the mid-Nineties, the Agency's basic educatioportfolio was continuing
                    each year at a level well over $125 million. Apparently the scepticism with
                    which the Agency's front office had viewed basic education over the nearly
                    thirty years of AID's existence before 1990 still prevailed, in the face of all
                    that was happening at home and abroad to stimulate commitment to basic
                    education.</p>
                <p>One last particular on what we did in the basic education category of R&amp;D/ED
                    projects at the end of my period there: recall Larry Summers' summary of the
                    World Bank's findings on the high value of investments in education for girls
                    and women. We had been active in this area for some time. Under the ABEL project
                    we commissioned through Creative Associates some very useful studies on how best
                    to design girls' and women's education projects, based on all the available
                    experience at AID and elsewhere. With the evidence we had and with the demand
                    which we knew was certain to follow, we decided that a separate program was
                    called for.</p>
                <p>Ann Van Dusen and Duff Gillespie, who had headed the R&amp;D Bureau's Health and
                    Population Offices, respectively, had become by 1993, following Rich Bissell's
                    departure, our Acting Assistant Administrator and Acting Deputy AA. Even at a
                    time when very few new projects were funded, they firmly encouraged the design
                    of a new program for girls' and women's education. So with the help of Creative
                    Associates, especially May Rihani, and with the in-house assistance of a capable
                    AAAS Fellow, Linda Padgett, who joined us from the Health Office for this
                    purpose, I personally took on the task of outlining the project and mustering
                    higher and wider support. On the basis of this outline, we won the green light
                    from the Education Sector Council and from Agency top management to begin full
                    scale, detailed project design. Just at this time, my tour came to an end and I
                    left for other things. But the Girls' and Women's Education Project (GWED) was
                    approved not long after, along the lines we had traced. One of the Agency's most
                    successful field practitioners of women's education, Suzie Clay, agreed to come
                    in from USAID/Guatemala to manage the new operation.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>This list of particulars would not be adequate without a short account of our
                    work in development communication, the other portion of R&amp;D/ED's total
                    portfolio. To an unusual degree, this area of AID activity was associated with
                    the work of one individual, Tony Meyer. But Tony, while based in R&amp;D/ED,
                    typically shared management responsibilities with some other R&amp;D technical
                    office for each project he designed, since development communication is, at
                    base, an applied specialty. As the manager of various contracts, most often with
                    the Academy for Educational Development, Tony had worked with collaborators in
                    the appropriate technical offices, which changed depending on the nature of the
                    program. He did this with S&amp;T/ Health, for example, to promote the use of
                    oral rehydration therapy, as I've mentioned, and with the Agency's AIDS office
                    to urge specific behaviors to slow the spread of HIV/AIDS.</p>
                <p>Shortly after he came to R&amp;D/ED, Rich Bissell expressed a lively interest in
                    development communication. As a very effective communicator himself, Rich wanted
                    to know more about AID's experience with the art and how the Agency might make
                    more and better use of a discipline in which AID, in the development community,
                    was already the leading practitioner. So in due course he gave me a very
                    interesting assignment. This was to chair a group consisting of Tony Meyer and
                    all those others in the R&amp;D Bureau and across the Agency who had had first
                    hand experience in the use of this technique. Bissell charged the group with
                    reflecting on what had worked and what had not, and with recommending to him
                    ways in which the Agency could employ “devcom” more systematically in AID's
                    operations.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, for a number of years, as I mentioned earlier, S&amp;T/ED had
                    created and regularly funded a Clearinghouse of Development Communication,
                    managed under contract by the Institute for International Research. The
                    Clearinghouse put out a quarterly report on devcom issues and innovations and
                    maintained an information service, including a document collection. To make full
                    use of the resource, we invited Mike Laflin to serve as secretary to our
                    committee. Mike was a professional in the field and was thoroughly familiar with
                    the Clearinghouse and with AID operations.</p>
                <p>The committee met at least once a month in the period April 1991 to March 1992.
                    We systematically reviewed, one after another, each of our current and past
                    activities in development communication. After we had made our reviews, we
                    pulled together the major lessons we had learned. Our report in booklet form,
                    entitled “The Substance Behind the Images: AID and Development Communication,”
                    provided a neat, readable summary of an area which AID had pioneered. We gave
                    the booklet wide circulation throughout the Agency, the USCEFA family, and the
                    donor community.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>At the same time we gave Rich Bissell a set of recommendations for how the Agency
                    could take fuller advantage of the Agency's expertise in this field. We
                    recommended that AID should provide briefings and training of current personnel
                    in the art of devcom, recruit new personnel with this specialty, and, most of
                    all, we should design new activities which utilized this experience. Bissell
                    signed off on many or all of these recommendations and sent them up to the
                    Administrator.</p>
                <p>Little did we expect that AID, along with most of the federal government, was to
                    freeze new hiring throughout the rest of the decade. But we proceeded
                    nonetheless, with Tony Meyer leading the way, to apply the art and science of
                    development communication to the environmental sector. We nicknamed the new
                    project GreenCOM. Tony, as usual, managed the project from our Office but the
                    core costs were funded largely by R&amp;D's Environmental Office. The project
                    has received enthusiastic reception and support by our missions, especially
                    those throughout Latin America and Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were also involved in the Women in Development Office
                        and the University Center. What were you trying to do with those?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Yes. Well, I'm sorry to say that these were both 911, emergency rescue
                    operations. I was called in to direct both offices after they had suffered
                    serious accidents and required an ambulance driver.</p>
                <p>Regarding the Women in Development (WID) Office, the political appointee who had
                    directed the Office resigned suddenly over Thanksgiving weekend, 1992. Rich
                    Bissell asked me, while continuing as Director of R&amp;D/ED, to take the
                    position for “a couple of months” until a permanent new Director could be found
                    for WID. These events did not come as a total surprise. The previous June,
                    Bissell had appointed me the co-Chair, along with the WID Director, of the
                    Bureau's WID Action Group. This committee was comprised of the Directors of all
                    the Offices in the R&amp;D Bureau. Our task was to design a plan for making
                    women's activities an integrated part of all our programs. This, plus the fact
                    that my co-Chair was too busy to attend any of our committee meetings, gave me a
                    general familiarity with the WID arena. Also, we in R&amp;D/ED had worked
                    closely with the WID Office, especially in the area of early childhood
                    development. We had heard rumors of discontent in the WID ranks. But I had no
                    idea of how bad things had become until I got there.</p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>The WID Office was larger than our Education Office, with at that time about 20
                    staff, mostly contract, and a core annual budget which had just been doubled to
                    $10 million. With the energetic direct hire Deputy Director, Martin Hewitt, we
                    worked for weeks to restore team spirit in the Office and months more to
                    schedule the allocation of our funds with the Regional Bureaus. Together, we
                    brought the WID agenda back into focus. Not until August 1993 was another direct
                    hire employee, Kathy Blakeslee, found to replace me as Acting Director. It took
                    a good deal longer after that to find a permanent Director. In the time I was
                    with WID, I think our only new initiative was a program to support the Latin
                    American countries in their preparations for the World Conference on Women,
                    scheduled for Beijing in 1995. This initiative we coordinated with the State
                    Department, which was given the lead in developing the U.S. position and in
                    organizing the U.S. delegation for the Beijing Conference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the University Center. What happened there? What was
                        proposed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: Before I can answer that, I need to recall briefly the context. The last
                    year of my tour with R&amp;D/ED was a time of more than usual tumult for the
                    Agency. Bill Clinton was elected President in November, 1992 and rapidly made
                    known who our new Administrator was to be. Upon taking office in January, Brian
                    Atwood relieved Rich Bissell of his duties straight away. But the new Assistant
                    Administrator for our R&amp;D Bureau (soon to be renamed, the Global Bureau) was
                    not appointed and confirmed for a year and a half, in May, 1994. The Clinton
                    Administration firmly believed that the Congress would abolish AID unless the
                    Agency was thoroughly “re-engineered” along lines which Atwood provided. So we
                    spent over a year from the Winter of 1993 until Spring of 1994 reinventing and
                    “right-sizing” ourselves. This exercise combined the usual house cleaning which
                    follows every presidential election with significant alterations to the house
                    itself.</p>
                <p>As I've said before, Ann Van Dusen, who served as Rich Bissell's Deputy for a
                    year or so before he left, became the Acting AA. She brought Duff Gillespie over
                    from the Population Office as her Acting Deputy. Their charge was to consolidate
                    R&amp;D's dozen Offices into five “Centers” to form a new “Global” Bureau. To
                    begin the process, they regrouped the Offices into five “Clusters” which were
                    each asked to prepare detailed plans for what the future Centers would do and
                    how they would be staffed. Each Cluster was helped by a corresponding Agency
                    work group. Thanks to this help, we Cluster people managed to get some regular
                    work done while all the reshuffling was going on.</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>In this way, from November, 1993 through March of the next year, I became the
                    head of the Human Resources Cluster, which grouped the Offices of Education,
                    International Training, Research, and the University Center. To add a dash of
                    spice to the general stew of confusion, the combined budget of the four offices
                    which constituted our Cluster was reduced from $29 million to $8 million in a
                    single year. This ignited exceptional anxiety among our staff, and we had as a
                    result in our Cluster 29 direct hire employees all wondering at once what they
                    would end up doing.</p>
                <p>This was the context in which I became directly involved with the University
                    Center. But the Center was undergoing its own identity crisis, only made more
                    difficult by the context I've just described. The Center's crisis was the result
                    of a battle fought at the end of the Ronald Roskens era, before the new
                    Administrator took charge.</p>
                <p>U.S. colleges and universities, remember, played a large role in the early years
                    of American foreign assistance. By the Nineties they wanted to continue to do
                    more in developing countries than just to educate and train foreign students on
                    their home campuses. Some very good U.S. higher educational institutions were
                    willing to put up their own funds to share with AID the costs of creating long
                    term “linkages” with universities in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and the Near
                    East.</p>
                <p>To devise a program which could leverage these funds, Roskens brought to AID, as
                    Director of the University Center, one of the best people he could have found.
                    This was Ralph Smuckler, a Dean at Michigan State University who had a long
                    history of involvement with foreign assistance anan inside knowledge of U.S.
                    land grand institutions. Dean Smuckler designed the university linkage program
                    in masterful fashion.</p>
                <p>But when he presented his program for approval, the Regional Bureaus, which, as
                    I've said, had a vote on the utility of R&amp;D programs, opposed it vehemently.
                    So far as I know, Administrator Roskens did little to support Smuckler's
                    program. Certainly the Administrator understood the Regional Bureaus' complaint:
                    that as AID funding levels dropped and as Congressional earmarks on remaining
                    funds persisted, very little discretionary funding was available to our field
                    missions to use for programs which they viewed as truly important. From the
                    standpoint of our field missions, the Smuckler program was just another attempt
                    by the U.S. higher education lobby to raid the small amount of funds still
                    available in the Agency to do what the Missions themselves saw needed to be
                    done. In any case, Dean Smuckler's program was shot down and he resigned.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>When the new Administrator took office, diminished funding left him with at least
                    two questions regarding the University Center, questions which were really
                    political in nature and had to be resolved at his level. First, Atwood needed to
                    decide what to do about the BIFAD program, which brought together the Title XII
                    land grant institutions in association with AID. Second, his decision was also
                    required on how to manage AID's relationship with the historically black
                    colleges and universitiethe HCBUs. These institutions up to this time had
                    received Agency grants each year to fund their unsolicited proposals and to
                    build their home campus capacity to deal with issues which interested AID. The
                    Administrator and his Counsel, Kelly Kammerer, dealt with these funding
                    decisions personally because they involved important constituents of the aid
                    program.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, at the day-to-day level, my main concern at the Center was to
                    meet regularly with a staff which had no idea of whether or not the ongoing
                    programs they managed would survive. Even more preoccupying, the Center staff
                    had no idea of where, if anywhere, they would find themselves in the new Center
                    being planned.</p>
                <p>At the same time, I was wrestling with two other matters. First, the core budget
                    for the operations of the Office of International Training had not been reduced
                    — it had been completely eliminated. This left the Training Office totally
                    dependent on funding from the Regional Bureaus, and some arrangement had to be
                    made fast if we were to save the training programs planned for the fiscal year
                    about to begin. My second concern, for the Office of Research, also part of my
                    cluster, was to find final funding for two major Agency research programs, which
                    had suddenly been marked for termination.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, for most of this period, November 1993 to March 1994, I was working
                    with my old colleague Norm Rifkin, who always seemed to turn up at the right
                    time. Norm had just come in from our Mission in Indonesia, where he had been our
                    Chief Education Advisor. He now was assigned to lead the work group which would
                    help us design our new Center for Human Capacity Development.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>We had not only to come up with a plan for the Center, but we were also asked to
                    present a rationale for why education should have its own, separate Center
                    rather than becoming part of one of the otherthe Economic Growth Center, for
                    example — as many were arguing should happen. Ultimately, our rationale and our
                    plan both won favor thanks in large measure to Norm's strong political
                    instincts. I became the Acting Director of the new HRDC Center in March, 1994
                    and helped to prepare the newly designated Assistant Administrator, Sally
                    Shelton-Colby, for her confirmation hearings on the Hill. My four year tour
                    having officially ended in February, Sally approved my request to leave the
                    Bureau on June 1 for a new assignment. She also approved Norm as my replacement
                    as Acting Director. All was finally in order and Norm was all set to take over
                    when on May 21st I suffered a light heart attack and had to withdraw for several
                    weeks to recovefully and without damage, I'm happy to say. The work of the new
                    Center never missed a beat. Norm arrived fully briefed, became Acting Director
                    on schedule, and the transition occurred without a hitch.</p>
                <p>When I came back to work full time, at the end of July, I found myself again
                    temporarily ineligible for an overseas assignment, and again for health reasons.
                    This time, the Africa Bureau asked me to lend a hand with organizing the new
                    Greater Horn of Africa Initiative (GHAI), under the leadership of one of the
                    Agency's most renowned remaining veterans, Ted Morse. I served as Ted's Deputy
                    for five interesting months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the Greater Horn initiative, what were you trying to
                        do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: The Greater Horn of Africa was a Presidential Initiative to encourage a more
                    comprehensive approach to the problems of, arguably, the world's most distressed
                    region. The initiative was an interagency affair, led by our Administrator, but
                    closely followed, as Presidential Initiatives always are, by the National
                    Security Council. Ted and I, as the two direct hire officers involved, led a
                    small and dedicated core staff of six full-time specialists. Together with
                    representatives of offices from across the Agency, we formed a working group
                    which met regularly and reported to the Assistant Administrator for Africa, John
                    Hicks.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>Our general charge was to develop a plan to deal with, as our mission statement
                    read, the root causes and short term consequences of chronic instability in
                    northeastern Africa, the area from the Red Sea to Tanzania. The “Greater Horn”
                    referred to a group of ten countries which included, in the northern tier, the
                    Sudan, Ethiopia, and Somalia, and in the south, Kenya, Uganda, and Tanzania.
                    Formally, Rwanda and Burundi were part of this region, as well, but for
                    practical purposes they were managed separately owing to the atrocities earlier
                    that year (1994) and the involvement of eastern Zaire. Our immediate task was to
                    draft a “concepts paper” which would serve as a framework for a long term
                    strategic plan to achieve “food security and crisis prevention” in the region.
                    We presented this paper to various audiences, using expertly designed visual
                    overheads, and secured approval in November 1994 to move ahead to develop a
                    first year budget. This was approved and the Agency allocated a modest amount,
                    $15 million for each oFY '95 and '96, for activities we proposed. These funds
                    were “new money,” over and above the amounts allocated to our several missions
                    in the same region.</p>
                <p>Clearly, there were some parallels between the Greater Horn initiative and the
                    Sahel program which I had helped to mount and manage two decades before. But
                    despite heroic efforts by Ted and his chief technical expert, Christy Cook, the
                    GHAI did not receive nearly the degree of AID or donor support we had enjoyed
                    earlier for the Sahel. The Administrator was severely constrained in the new
                    funding he could allocate without the special support of the Congress. Our
                    Missions in the area and REDSO/EA all were already managing on-going programs
                    and were not convinced that a new initiative could greatly improve upon their
                    efforts. In fact, they were naturally nervous that their budgets might be
                    reduced to make room for this new presidential brainchild. The other donors
                    reacted coolly, anticipating that this plan might be a ploy to extract from them
                    funding for an international program for which the U.S. would then take credit.
                    Despite all this, the Greater Horn was certainly deserving of all the attention
                    we could give it. We got the GHAI funded and off to as good a start as we could
                    expecunder the circumstances.</p>
                <p>Just at this point, in January 1995, the Management Bureau made an enthusiastic
                    appeal for my help. John Hummon, who had been the Program Officer in Tanzania
                    when I first arrived there in 1966, and Irv Coker, the Deputy Director of the
                    Sahel Program to whom I had reported in the 1974-76 period and who was now a
                    private consultant, asked if I would be willing to serve as the Chair of a new
                    Agency personnel panel. Normally, I would not have found this request
                    compelling. But this panel was different. It had just been created to help
                    select AID's first major intake of direct hire officers in a number of years, a
                    subject I felt was of vital importance. Also, I had just finished doing what I
                    thought I could do best with and for Ted Morse on the Greater Horn, and Ted
                    consented to my transfer.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>My only apprehension in taking on the new assignment was that it might prove
                    futile. I feared that the Agency's operating expenditures (OE) account would not
                    be adequate to enable us to bring on the new officers we so badly needed. So
                    before accepting the assignment I made known my concern about the potential
                    shortage of OE funding. In response, I was told that the Administrator had
                    assured Management that the Agency needed the new recruits so badly that he was
                    prepared to sacrifice elsewhere, if necessary, to make room for them. With this
                    assurance, I enthusiastically accepted.</p>
                <p>On February 8, 1995, I joined the selection panel and we began the interviews. A
                    long period of pre-selection had already taken place, in which technical panels
                    for each of the major skills areahealth, education, agriculture, and so ohad
                    sifted through literally thousands of applications to identify the 220
                    technically best qualified candidates for the 70 positions available, 40 at
                    mid-level and 30 intern positions.</p>
                <p>Our panel was established as an innovation in the selection process. We were to
                    interview each of the 220 finalists and to select the 70 distributed among the
                    various technical specialties with the best interpersonal and management skills.
                    Irv Coker had done a great deal of work to give us the standard questions we
                    would ask and the procedures we needed to make the selection, and he joined me
                    and two others on the panel. The other members were Barbara Howard, my former
                    Deputy Program Officer in Senegal, and Mary Huntington, both veteran officers
                    with long AID experience in the field.</p>
                <p>Our panel met day in and day out from February 8 through May 17 interviewing each
                    of the 220 candidates. We then ran final selection panels with representatives
                    of each of the technical panels, which included specialists from the Regional
                    Bureaus and the Global Bureau, to come up with our final choices. We were all
                    very impressed by the high quality of men and women whom we interviewed. They
                    were so eager to join our Agency on a career basis that they paid their own way
                    to an hour's interview with us. Some came from across the country and others
                    from across the sea. One flew in from Nepal. Their enthusiasm was extremely
                    gratifying to all of us. Despite the long hours together, for over three months,
                    our panel worked very constructively together. John Hummon and his Deputy, Pam
                    White, were very pleased with the results, and our technical colleagues,
                    especially so.</p>
                <p>Regrettably, the entire exercise turned out to be a complete waste of time. The
                    Agency hired just a very few, a handful, of the candidates, including some we
                    had not even recommended. I learned this later from my position at the National
                    Defense University.</p>

                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>REA: Our worst fear: in the end, despite the assurances we had received, the OE
                    funding did not materialize. This disappointment was compounded soon after, in
                    1996, when the infamous Reduction in Force (RIF) exercise flushed out over 90 of
                    the Agency's best mid-career Foreign Service officers. The one consolation in
                    retrospect, I suppose, is that if the Agency had hired the 70 candidates whom we
                    recommended, they all would have been fired the very next year.</p>

                </p>
                <p>Teaches at ICA1995-1997</p>
                <p>REA: I accepted an assignment to the faculty at ICAF, the Industrial College of
                    the Armed Forces, where I served my final two years as an AID employee as the
                    AID Chair and led seminars in political science, African area studies, and in
                    the ICAF signature course, the “Elements of National Power.”</p>
                <p>By Spring 1995 I had two years to go until my Time In Class (TIC) ran out. An
                    overseas assignment for this brief period was out of the question. The person
                    responsible for “executive management” assignments, Bob McDonald, told me that
                    AID had a position at ICAF which he had not been able to fill for two or three
                    years. Bob and his Deputy, Carla Royalty, saw a good fit for me there and
                    suggested I take the job.</p>
                <p>Recall that at this time, after Management had made sharp cuts in training for
                    AID personnel (including the most regrettable deep-sixing of the Development
                    Studies Program), the only long term training opportunities which the Agency
                    still offered its employees were the ten month programs at ICAF and the National
                    War College. Both Colleges are situated side by side on the campus of the
                    National Defense University, which is located at Ft. McNair in South West
                    Washington, D.C. near the point where the Potomac and Anacostia Rivers come
                    together. AID maintained one position for an instructor at each of the Colleges,
                    in return for which each school accepted, tuition free, one or two AID officers
                    every year for the August to June training course.</p>
                <p>When Bob first suggested to me teaching at ICAF I was interested but cautious,
                    since I wasn't drawn to “industrial” studies, as ICAF's name implied. Since
                    nobody was around at AID who was teaching or had taught at ICAF, I went over to
                    Ft. McNair to talk with AID's current instructor at the War College, a former
                    Assistant Administrator whom I had much admired, Mary Kilgour. I also spoke with
                    the AID Officer then in training at ICAF, Richard Byess, an experienced field
                    officer whom I had known when he served in Mali. Both assured me that a tour at
                    ICAF would be two of the best years of my career. They urged me to accept the
                    assignment. I did. They were right.</p>
                <p>I won't say much about ICAF, since my time there would not shed much light on the
                    history of AID operations. But I do have a couple of comments which may be
                    relevant.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>The first is that the quality othe AID officers who trained at ICAF made me very
                    proud. Nearly every year, as I learned from the plaques on the walls, and as I
                    observed during my two years there, an AID officer ranked in ICAF's top ten per
                    cent of graduates, the honor roll. This was not easily done, since ICAF and the
                    War College both trained some of the best mid-career officers in the U.S.
                    foreign affairs agencies. These included the five military services, the State
                    Department, USIA, and the CIA. Moreover, I saw that even those of our people who
                    were not ranked in the top 10% of their class were accustomed to dealing with
                    the really large world issues of our time: population growth, environmental
                    degradation, food and water supply, illiteracy, disease, poverty, and human
                    rights. My fellow instructors were invariably delighted to have an AID officer
                    assigned to their seminars because, as they frequently told me, the AID people
                    stirred up many of the most useful discussions.</p>
                <p>Despite the high quality of our officers, however, my other observation was
                    sobering. AID's profile was nearly invisible for the vast majority of our
                    students. In the two years I taught at ICAF, not a single student in any of my
                    seminars initiated a comment about U.S. foreign assistance, pro or con. Except
                    among our State Department brethren, it was assumed, where AID was recognized at
                    all, that we had more or less merged into State as USIA was doing or, to the
                    less well informed, that AID had somehow become a kind of adjunct to the World
                    Bank.</p>
                <p>The one area in which the work of our Agency had clear definition was in our
                    disaster assistance role. Here we often worked closely with Air Force transport
                    personnel and Army engineers. But I noted that even this function, administered
                    by our Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance (OFDA), nearly always turned up in
                    the press without any recognition that OFDA was a part of AID. So I was left
                    with the impression that by the second half of the 1990s, if not before, AID had
                    almost entirely disappeared off the public and professional radar. As our
                    military colleagues might have said in the lingo of the day, AID by this time
                    had gone “stealthy.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, some final comments. Looking back over your career,
                        what is your feeling about U.S. foreign assistance in international

                </p>
                <p>Concluding Observations</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>REA: My feeling, despite the management problems I experienced at the end, is
                    very positive. Overall, I believe that the U.S. foreign assistance program has
                    made a constructive difference in doing what we set out to do: to improve the
                    conditions of life in the societies with which we have worked, and to expand the
                    range of choices for individuals within those societies in a sustainable
                    fashion. We've done so directly, through our own programs, but perhaps even more
                    so indirectly, by our support of donor partners of all stripes, public and
                    private. We've made many mistakes, but I believe that we have learned from them.
                    We've sown a great deal of seed, and much has fallen on rocky ground. But some,
                    too, has multiplied a thousandfold. At the same time, I have the sense that the
                    U.S. foreign assistance chapter is closing, at least in terms of “development.”
                    I hope I'm wrong, but it appears to me that AID is becoming more closely allied
                    with the short-term goals of U.S. foreign policy, including Presidential
                    Initiatives. AID appears to be more than ever responsive to the many
                    humanitarian and development interests, praiseworthy as they all may be, upon
                    which we depend for support in the Congress. AID seems to be, to coin a word,
                    disaggregating.</p>
                <p>While we all may have our own special feelings about AID, I think everyone who
                    has worked with the Agency agree on a few things about the climate, or context,
                    in which we work: that AID is too bureaucratic, our contracting too slow and
                    restrictive, our programming too rigid. Congress micromanages us too much, State
                    deflects too many resources from developmental purposes. The American public is
                    in the dark about what we do and how much we spend. It's easy to talk about the
                    context in ways like this. But AID is itself the proverbial elephant and more
                    difficult to describe. It is nearly 40 years old. It is large and lumberinbut
                    also contains much more intelligence than it may look at first appearance. And
                    our only real knowledge of AID depends for each of us, as for the equally
                    proverbial blind man, on the areas of the beast we each have touched
                    personally.</p>
                <p>As my account bears out, I've touched AID at two main points: at the African
                    point, both from the Washington and the field ends, and at the global point, in
                    the R&amp;D Bureau. At both points my work has been almost entirely concerned
                    with the side of AID which deals with development, as contrasted with disaster
                    assistance or “security” motivated programming. I'm very grateful to have
                    avoided some of the great sink-holes of AID's historVietnam, for example, and
                    the waste of our efforts in the Cold War African extravagances of Liberia,
                    Zaire, the Sudan, and Somalia. These four country programs ate up a fifth of the
                    $22 billion we have put into Africa in the fifty years since 1945. So I've been
                    one of the fortunate ones, and the nature of my experience with AID must color
                    my positive feelings about U.S. foreign assistance generally.</p>
                <p>But I have a good deal of evidence to support these positive feelings. The other
                    day I had a chance to go over the account which the Africa Bureau put out in
                    1996, “Making a Difference.” The report, among other things, lists some of the
                    results which our African programs have achieved over the years. I took notes on
                    the results of some of the programs on which I have worked at first hand. I'd
                    like to cite just a few of these to give you a better sense of why I am positive
                    about what we have done.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>According to the 1996 Report:</p>
                <p>In Madagascar, our partnership with IRRI and the Malagasy Agriculture Research
                    Institute has produced new rice varieties that double yields without fertilizer
                    and achieve 300% to 400% increases with fertilizer. Nine varieties orice suited
                    for various situations were released in 1995 alone.</p>
                <p>In South Africa, we assisted a program of interactive radio lessons called
                    “English in Action.” The radio lessons and companion classroom materials are
                    produced by the Open Learning Systems Educational Trust for pilot programs in
                    four provinces. Students now using the daily lesson have tested significantly
                    higher on skills tests than students in comparison groups. A teacher spoke for
                    her colleagues in saying that in over 30 years of teaching, she “had never come
                    across something as good as this.”</p>
                <p>In Senegal, anti-salt and water retention dikes have led to a 20% increase in
                    cultivated land in the Casamance region of the south. In the north, encroaching
                    sand dunes have been stabilized through tree-planting funded with Title III
                    resources. Other donors expanded on our success so that, today, the entire
                    northern coast covering 4000 hectares has been reforested and is now Senegal's
                    primary vegetable production zone.</p>
                <p>Botswana in September 1995 became AID's first African “graduate” country, our
                    firshost-country in Africa to achieve a sustainable level of development. In
                    addition, the report lists our ten year basic education program there as one of
                    the most important of our contributions. The S&amp;T/ED office helped to design
                    this program and we continued to backstop the program after I came to the ED
                    Office. The Botswana basic education program was one of our most comprehensive
                    undertakings. As the AFR report points out, it centered on the development of a
                    new curriculum and was coupled with the training of 80% of the country's primary
                    and secondary school teachers. This training took place at various teacher
                    colleges which AID constructed and equipped. The most important of these was the
                    new education department of the University of Botswana, which has now become a
                    regional center, as well. During the 10 years of the project, the number of
                    primary schools in Botswana increased by 40% and enrollment expanded by 60%.
                    Today, primary and junior secondary school enrollment in Botswana is above 90%
                    and adult literacy is over 80%, much higher than in any other African
                    country.</p>

                <p>In the Sahel region as a whole, African states and donors organized a famine
                    early warning system (FEWS), developed more drought resistant grains and
                    liberalized agricultural markets. These investments have helped avert disaster
                    in the Sahel in the two decades since. What is more, the approach taken in the
                    Sahel was adapted to Southern Africa after the 1991-92 drought disaster there,
                    when AID provided that region with $800 million in relief. Using the Sahel
                    Program experience, farmers in the region planted the drought resistant
                    varieties of maize, millet, and sorghum AID had helped develop. Governments in
                    the region adopted the open agriculture market policies which we encouraged. So
                    when drought of a similar magnitude returned to Southern Africa a couple of
                    years later, no emergency donor food aid was required at all. (Ted Morse, who
                    had been the USAID Director in Zimbabwe during that time, was immensely pleased
                    with this result. He was hard at work applying these lessons to the Greater Horn
                    region at the time he asked me to assist him with that Initiative.)</p>
                <p>These are all examples of where AID has made a difference. I have chosen from the
                    Report only the examples which grew out of work which I have had a hand in
                    doing. But the Report gives many other examples. And these, let's remember, are
                    all drawn from what our Africa Bureau likes to call the “final frontier” of
                    development, Sub-Saharan Africa, collectively recognized as the Agency's hardest
                    case countries. It's not hard to think of the even greater success which U.S.
                    foreign assistance has enjoyed worldwide in such countries as Turkey, Taiwan,
                    Thailand, and South Korea, some of our other “graduates.” We have helped to
                    plant the seeds of development. Most of our discouragement comes, I think, when
                    we do not look at our work in a large enough perspective, or with too short a
                    time line. This is particularly true in Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In what areas do you think AID or the foreign assistance
                        program has made over the years the most significant contributions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: From what I've seen and learned, AID's most important work overall has been
                    in the three major areas of food production, family planning, anhealth and child
                    survival.</p>
                <p>A great deal has been written about our role in South Asia, particularly, in
                    fostering the Green Revolution. The agriculture research stations represented by
                    the CGIAR (the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research),
                    which AID with the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations did so much to establish,
                    have done outstanding work with each of the major food crops upon which the
                    human race depends. At the same time, we've also learned and transmitted a great
                    deal about the kinds of infrastructure and agricultural policies which are
                    equally essential to major advances in food production.</p>
                <p>In family planning AID is credited with having the most expertise of any
                    development agency, and we have provided half the international funding for this
                    world-wide effort.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>Our leadership and support in health and child survival, especially with the
                    “twin motors” of oral rehydratiopractices and inoculation campaigns, have been
                    exemplary. More recently, we have been a leader in the HIV/AIDS arena.</p>
                <p>More intangible, but I think just as evident, has been the influence of our
                    thinking in extremely important areas of development such as the environment,
                    women in development, and good governance.</p>
                <p>I would also maintain that AID has played an important role in formal education.
                    The Agency made very significant contributions to higher education in the 1960's
                    with capital funds and technical assistance to build up post-secondary
                    institutions. This work included the introduction of our land grant college
                    model, which combined education with research and extension services — even
                    though host countries did not always apply the concept as intended. Since the
                    mid-1980s, we have made very constructive contributions in basic education using
                    our systems approach, sometimes combined with technology.</p>
                <p>It's true that we haven't contributed nearly as much funding and person power in
                    these latter areas as we have in agriculture, family planning, and health. But
                    what we have done, and especially the way in which we have configured our
                    programs to ensure that environmental impact and gender equity issues are always
                    accounted for in everything we do, has been widely noted and adopted by the
                    donor community. Thanks largely to our example and our influence on the World
                    Bank and other donor organizations, our environmental and gender equity
                    practices have been accepted as integral and necessary parts of any responsible
                    approach to sustainable development. Also, at the present time we may be
                    ploughing new ground in the promotion of democratic practices.</p>
                <p>But I would hope that anyone interested in the answer to your question would
                    refer to Joe Wheeler's reply, which I trust is part of this oral history series.
                    As a former Deputy Administrator of AID who went on to Chair the Development
                    Assistance Committee of the OECD, and as one who was a chief organizer of the
                    World Conference on the Environment and Development at Rio in 1992, Mr. Wheeler
                    is one of the few former AID foreign service officers of whom I am aware — you,
                    Ray Love and Art Fell are three others because of the work you have done since
                    leaving AID — with the large perspective which is needed to do complete justice
                    to your question.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>If you asked me to tell you in one word what I believe to be AID's most
                    significant achievement, I think that word would be “education” education in the
                    widest, historic sense. “Education” interpreted broadly has been the common
                    denominator in all of our programs, everywhere. I'm not just thinking of the
                    many thousands of men and women whom we have trained in long and short term
                    courses and as counterparts on the job, or of the children and young people
                    enrolled in formal education programs we have supported. But in everything we
                    have done, even in the failures where our time and money may seem to have been
                    entirely wasted, our efforts at development have conveyed a set of attitudes:
                    that problems can be solved, change can be directed, technologies matter,
                    policies are important, free market democracy is a goal worth striving for, and
                    that you can get there from here. Whatever else we have done, our foreign
                    assistance program has been a powerful agent for education in this sense,
                    although we have made a greater impact in some societies, at different levels,
                    and during certain times than others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about your own views and your experience
                        overall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>REA: If we can, I suppose we all choose the career which will teach us the most
                    about what chiefly interests us and which offers us at the same time a chance to
                    make a difference. For anyone attracted by what it is that makes countries grow
                    and flourish, and for anyone who wants to help large groups of people to get a
                    handle on a better life, I would certainly recommend a career in foreign
                    assistance. For me, AID all by itself has been a liberal education. My
                    colleagues have come from every specialty and background. Our host country
                    national colleagues have taught me much more than I have them. The opportunity
                    to work and live and travel in the major regions of Sub-Saharan AfricEast,
                    South, West, and the Indian Oceahas been the adventure of a lifetime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If some young person came up to you and said I'm looking
                        for a career, would you recommend a career in this business in AID?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>REA: Yes. I tell everyone the same thing, I must admit. Here, I'm confident I
                    know the best route to take. I recommend that undergraduates test their interest
                    in our kind of work by getting experience in a developing region, either in the
                    Peace Corps or in some other way. Next, assuming this test was positive, I
                    advise that he or she take an M.A. or equivalent in a professional program with
                    a strong international component, including some grounding in economics and
                    another language. I do recommend that they apply to AID directly, but I would
                    insist that they apply at the same time to all the AID contractors in their
                    professional field. I don't encourage young people to expect a career with AID.
                    There are too many signals lately that the Agency which we have known, oriented
                    towards long-term growth and development, is evolving into something else.
                    Meanwhile, NGOs like the Carter Center are more important, autonomous channels
                    than before. Of course, there are all the multilaterals, as well. And many other
                    avenues for encouraging growth abroad are emerging, especially in trade and
                    investment.</p>
