                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: January 10, 2005</p>
                <p>Copyright 2009 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is January 10th, 2005. This is an interview with
                        Charlotte Roe, R-O-E. I imagine you've had all sorts of comments about
                        Richard Roe and John Doe and Jane Roe. Do you ever get that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: Once every so often. Just recently someone who wanted to buy a harp
                    accessory asked me, with trepidation, if I was related to the Roe in Roe versus
                    Wade. One of my passions is playing the Irish harp. I had a silver harp ring
                    that raises the pitch by a half-tone if you pluck the string with the ring
                    against it. The prospective buyer was from deep Bible country in Virginia. The
                    “Roe” handle apparently made her fear she was dealing with the devil incarnate.
                    It reminded me what power a name can confer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Roe versus Wade. You might explain what that decision
                        was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: That was the landmark Supreme Court decision of 1973 that overturned state
                    and federal laws banning abortion in the U.S. Jane Roe was the fictitious name
                    of the plaintiff, so in this context, being Roe means being pro-choice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I should mention that this interview is being done on
                        behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training and I'm
                        Charles Stuart Kennedy. Can you tell me when and where you were born and
                        talk about your family?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>ROE: I was born in Pleasantville, New York in 1942 during the Second World War,
                    in a family of sevemy mother, father, three sisters and our grandfather, Edward
                    Stevens Roe, who lived with us until his death. My dad, Edward Gaynor Roe, was a
                    patent attorney. Dad graduated from Dartmouth College and put himself through
                    New York Law School at night. He never forgot his origins. He was a person of
                    great compassion who hated injustice and identified with people who struggled
                    for a living. He played the cello, had a great booming laugh, loved opera, Irish
                    music, Rogers and Hammerstein and was a fan of Paul Robeson, with whom he once
                    sang. He ran a small law practice on 25 West Forty-Third Street, a one-man law
                    office in New York City that did trademark work for Chase Manhattan, Melville
                    Shoes and other companies. His door was open for low-paying patent work on
                    behalf of countless individual inventors. His big clients wanted him to go
                    corporate, but he was committed to remain independent at any cost. My mother,
                    Eloise Tarbell—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you spell that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: T-A-R-B-E-L-L.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, any relation to the muckraker?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: She was a distant cousin of Ida Tarbell who wrote the history of the
                    Standard Oil company, the first of the expos�s about robber barons and
                    industrial exploitation —</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>ROE: Yes. Tarbell, Upton Sinclair, and other investigative journalists set the
                    stage for the social and economic reforms of the Progressive era. My mother was
                    raised by her grandfather, Gage Eli Tarbell, a vice president of Equitable Life
                    Insurance Company. His father, Charles, had a small farm in Smithville Flats,
                    New York that was started by our great-great grandfather, and Captain Eli
                    Tarbell, who moved there from Vermont in 1816. Gage bought the land from
                    Charles. When Gage resigned from Equitable in 1907, he modernized and expanded
                    the homestead into a dairy farm that raised purebred Guernseys. Tarbell Farms
                    had one of the largest Guernsey herds in the U.S. They sold milk to many
                    restaurants in New York, among them the Waldorf Astoria and the Oyster Bar in
                    Grand Central Station. Besides the beautiful Guernsey herd, there were Berkshire
                    pigs, Shropshire sheep, Angora goats and many striking breeds of fowl. Tarbell
                    cooperated with Cornell University in applied agricultural research, and
                    employed dozens of farmers, some from Great Britain and Denmark. Tarbell was our
                    haven. We spent every summer on that farm, surrounded by animals and lakes and
                    open meadows. This was where my sisters and I ran wild, rode horses to our
                    hearts' content, explored the woods and bothered the farm management. When
                    thunder clouds piled up, nothing was better than running to the barns to cuddle
                    with the calves in the hay. Our cousins, Sandee and Sue Tarbell, lived in the
                    neighboring town and were great company. Our folks couldn't possibly keep up
                    with us, so at a certain point they threw up their hands and enjoyed the
                    summertime.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you milk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: We were not allowed to, but I did anyway. The farm manager, Mrs. A.K.
                    (Alice) Wightman, wore jodhpurs and tall riding boots. Her stepson, Otis
                    Wightman, was chief herdsman and a good friend of our family. Alice ran a tight
                    ship. She wanted us to keep our distance from the hired hands. That made us
                    subversive. I loved hanging around old George Chapman, an Englishman, whose
                    knowledge and love of the cows and calves awed me. Tarbell had automated milking
                    machines and at 4 a.m. they took these off and finished milking by hand. At
                    times I'd get up really early and try my hand. Outwitting Mrs. Wightman's boots
                    and crop was a great thrill and probably my start as a rebel.</p>
                <p>The farm was co-owned by my grandmother, Louise Tarbell, and her brother, whom we
                    called Uncle Swift. Swift Tarbell owned a restaurant in downtown Princeton, N.J.
                    called “the Balt,” but he lived on the farm where he kept Palominos and
                    Tennessee walking horses and had a wonderful collection of Western saddles. We
                    rode his horses during the summer but eventually got our own steeds, first a
                    pony named Teddy and later a quarter horse racer called Cyclone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, do you know where the Roes came from? Have you—</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>ROE: The Roes were Irish. On the maternal side of my father's family, Peter Riley
                    and Mary Elizabeth Gaynor, my great grandparents, emigrated from Ireland during
                    the potato famine. They came through Castle Garden in New York City —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had the so-called plague ships that had fever and
                        all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: It was hard times. They survived the crossing with some small savings and
                    dreams of getting their own place. We believe they met on the ship. After going
                    through immigration they took off for the countryside by train and lost all
                    their money to land swindlers. Somehow they ended up in upstate New York, in
                    Phelps, New York, not far from Rochester. Peter Riley became a potato farmer.
                    Their original farm is still in Phelps. The only picture I have of my great
                    grandfather shows him holding a beautiful woven basket of potatoes and sporting
                    a long white beard.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really long.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: Only compared to todays. My father Ed identified with the Irish
                    revolutionaries and freedom fighters of many lands. In college, I got involved
                    in the civil rights movement and wanted to join the Freedom Rides in the South.
                    Dad said, “You know Charlotte, the most downtrodden group and one that's still
                    forgotten is the American Indian.” Dartmouth had a program of scholarships for
                    American Indians. Whenever he met someone of Native American heritage during his
                    commutes to New York City and Washington, Dad would talk up Dartmouth and help
                    them get scholarships. That was one of his passions. Before he retired, our
                    cousin Jack Riley talked with Ed about whether or not to pursue a law career. He
                    credits my Dad with inspiring him to do it, and he built a successful practice
                    near the Phelps homestead.</p>
                <p>On my mother's side we have a distant but intriguing French-Mohawk
                    connection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, where do the Tarbells come from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: The Tarbells came from southern France near the Basque region of the
                    Pyrenees. They were one of three Celtic tribes in the Aquitani nation in
                    southwestern Gaul and they lived along the Adour river where there are thermal
                    waters. The Romans called the site “Aqua Tarbellicae” and over time the central
                    spa town became known as Dax, which still has mineral springs. The Tarbelli, as
                    they were then called, were reportedly horsemen and horse traders. After the
                    Romans defeated the Celts, most Tarbells immigrated north. We're told that our
                    ancestor, Thomas Tarbell, came to Massachusetts from England or Wales on the
                    Winthrop in 1647.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>One of Thomas' sons, John Tarbell, married Mary Nurse, the daughter of Francis
                    and Rebecca Towne Nurse. During the Salem witchcraft craze of 1692, Rebecca was
                    accused and hung as a witch after a tumultuous trial. She was then 71, perhaps
                    the most respected person in the community. Dozens of townspeople signed a
                    petition on her behalf. The jury found her not guilty but was ordered to
                    reconsider. She was granted a reprieve by the governor. The reprieve expired.
                    The wave of revulsion over her execution eventually brought an end to those
                    hysterical pseudo-trials. Rebecca's body was left half-buried, half-exposed on
                    Gallows Hill. Her husband and son-in-law defied the law to row over at night and
                    bring her to rest in the family cemetery. Rebecca Nurse's story was told in
                    Arthur Miller's play, The Crucible and in many books about the tragedy. We
                    learned about her fate growing up and couldn't forget what happens when people
                    let intolerance and fear take over their communities. Recently I learned from my
                    cousin Albert Tarbell that a member of his Mohawk tribe helped Rebecca's
                    children rescue her body.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you have quite a collection of mavericks and martyrs in
                        the family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Roe: Yes, we have some active ancestor guides. The French-Indian warwhich from a
                    Native American perspective were really the French-British or Queen Anne's
                    waalso dramatically affected the Tarbell family. This takes me to the story of
                    how the captured Tarbell children became chiefs of the St. Regis Mohawk tribe.
                    During the war, the nations of the Iroquois confederacy sometimes raided the
                    colonists in an effort to replenish the young people they had lost in the
                    conflict, which they considered was not of their making. In 1707, Caughnawaga
                    (Mohawk) warriors carried off three of Thomas Tarbell's grandchildreSarah, John
                    and Zachariah, who were first cousins to Rebecca Nurse's children. The three
                    Tarbell children survived the long walk to the Canadian border, and they were
                    adopted into the tribe. Their family tried to get them back in vain. Later the
                    two boys, on the verge of adulthood, visited their birthplace in Groton,
                    Massachusetts. But they chose not to return. John Demos wrote a fascinating book
                    about this experience called the Unredeemed Captive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about that—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: The book explored the real sagas of kidnapped children and the clash of
                    cultures, the Puritans with their restrictive cultures vs. the Iroquois with
                    their more open, child-friendly cultures, and what happened when families tried
                    to get their children back, but the children instead chose to remain. The
                    Tarbell daughter, Sarah, was eventually taken to a convent in Montreal. The
                    boys, Zachariah and John, married the chief's daughters. Within a few years the
                    French missionary who worked with the tribe told them, “You're causing too much
                    trouble by staying here. Why not start your own settlement?” They went down
                    river and their sons founded the St. Regis Mohawks. Since that time, each
                    generation has elected a Tarbell as chief of the St. Regis, whose reservation
                    spans the U.S. and Canada on the St. Lawrence River.</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>We heard slivers of the Mohawk Tarbell story growing up but never knew for sure
                    if it was true; this was before the internet made many of these historical
                    events easily accessible. Still, we felt a strong emotional kinship with the
                    tribe. Reading about the Mohawk ironworkers building the skyscrapers of New York
                    and seeing the clippings my mother kept about Tarbell chiefs, we always wondered
                    out loud if we were related. Then one day our cousin Anne Quin Olney went to a
                    sculpture exhibit in Michigan by Tami Tarbell, an accomplished Mohawk ceramic
                    artist. “Quini” looked at Tami and said, “You're Tarbell. I'm Tarbell.” Tami
                    said, “Oh, you must be from the white branch of the family.” So we found each
                    other that way. I called information and located Albert, Tami's father, and
                    visited them in Nedrow, New York. Among his many talents, Albert Tarbell is an
                    amateur genealogist. He knows more about the Tarbell history than any in our
                    family. Albert was a paratrooper in the Eighty-second Airborne in World War Two.
                    He survived the Wahl river crossing, fought in the Battle of the Bulge and
                    helped liberate one of the death camps in Germany. His portrait hangs in
                    Syracuse community center and his combat experiences are recounted in several
                    books. A recent one I strongly recommend, Brave Men, Gentle Heroes, tells
                    several father-son tales including those of Albert and his son, Mike, who fought
                    in the Special Forces during several tours in Vietnam. During a long, troubled
                    post-war rehabilitation, Mike Tarbell became involved in teaching about Iroquois
                    heritage within the public schools. He's now a curator at the Iroquois Museum in
                    Howes Cave in upstate New York.</p>

                <p>ROE: Ed's father, Edward Stevens Roe, was an officer of the American Rubber
                    Corporation. He lost his job during the Depression. “Pom Pom,” as we called him,
                    supported himself as a clerk on Wall Street and kept that job until he died,
                    when I was eight and a half. In 1904 he had bought a house in Pleasantville,
                    when Daddy was two years old. When I was born in 1942, Pom Pom called his son
                    and asked him to buy his house on 19 Orchard Street because he had a tenant, an
                    opera singer, who had a very large goose. The operatic goose was running amok,
                    making a mess of the place, and he didn't have the heart to evict them.</p>
                <p>My grandmother was Charlotte Gaynor Riley. A niece, Riley, and I both carry her
                    name. Charlotte met Edward at the New York Conservatory of Music. They tied the
                    knot in NYC in 1900. She was a professional singer and pianist who sang on
                    cruises to Europe when she was single. Charlotte died before I was born. I
                    inherited her Irish music books and her Steinway piano. Our grandfather was a
                    gentle, sweet influence when we were young. He tried to bring some peace to the
                    household, and taught us kids to ride bicycles. He showed us what strength lies
                    in humility.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: There were five of us girlmy sisters Noel, Rebecca and Annand a cousin Quini
                    who lived with us during high school. After graduating from Western College, my
                    mother married Buck Folk, a dashing First Lieutenant and later a Colonel in the
                    Artillery branch of the Army. This was the roaring 20's. Some of Buck's Army
                    pals were skirt-chasers and my mother balked at the culture. After a difficult
                    divorce, they eventually came to be on good terms. Their daughter, Noel, grew up
                    with us and my father adopted her after marrying Eloise in 1939. Noel was six
                    years older than my older sister, Becky. When Noel was in high school, our first
                    cousin Anne Quin (whom we called Quini) also lived with us. We girls came in
                    waves, and took turns inhabiting a small but magical bedroom in the attic. I
                    imagine we were a handful to raise. We squabbled like little foxes at times.
                    Amazingly we remain close and share many interests.</p>

                <p>ROE: Environmental protection. Nature awareness. Endangered species. Native
                    American culture and history. Horses, dogs, farming. Good books. Not putting up
                    with those who abuse power. We love antiques and old things that tell stories.
                    We cherish things that are real and made by hand, like textiles or good home
                    cooked and ethnic food. We have certain political differences but are all drawn
                    to international and ancestral connections. My oldest sister Noel was a ski
                    instructor, real estate agent and bed &amp; breakfast owner; my next older
                    sister Becky a special education teacher, horsewoman and accountant; and the
                    youngest, Anne is an artist, art teacher, and healevery different walks of life.
                    All three are big-time grandmothers now. They gave me great moral support during
                    my own troubled times and when I lived abroad.</p>

                <p>ROE: Eloise went to Barnard College in New York for two years, and graduated from
                    Western College for Women in Ohio. She had that rebel gene. She came to
                    adulthood in the roaring twenties. Her mother was a real estate developer who
                    was involved in starting the first cooperative apartments in New York City.
                    Eloise was working at B. Altman's in New York City when she met my father. She
                    gave that up to become a full-time mom. She wanted to have the kind of solid
                    home her parents had never given her. During the year after her divorce Noel and
                    Quini lived with another family in New Jersethat left some scars. Mom's
                    mothering instincts extended to plants, relatives, neighbors, a broad spectrum.
                    She told me her thesis at Western was about how the races should mix. Her
                    reasoning was that if people could overcome their prejudices and biases and let
                    the different ethnic groups mingle, we would be stronger, more diverse, and more
                    vibrant intellectually. Her teachers looked at her and said, “Where in the world
                    did you get these ideas?”</p>
                <p>Her grandfather Gage Eli Tarbell and his family had been influenced by the
                    Universalist church, which had strong roots in rural New York and was connected
                    to the abolitionists and the Underground Railroad. Gage would tell her, “Eloise,
                    if there's a black woman on the bus and nobody gives her a seat, if you don't
                    give her your seat, you're no daughter of mine. If there's a black woman on the
                    bus and nobody sits with her, if you don't sit with her, you're no daughter of
                    mine.” So she grew up with pretty advanced ideas for her time. Which I, being a
                    typically mutinous teenager, had to grow up to appreciate. Mother didn't reveal
                    several of these chapters of her life to us until she was into her prime. Maybe
                    she had to wait until we could listen up better.</p>
                <p>Eloise loved to talk. She could befriend anyone in her line of chatting. She had
                    a phenomenal memory for family connections. Ask her how distant kin were related
                    and she would cite bright genealogical branches from memory, with telling
                    details and embellishments about ancestors, just like Celtic bards or African
                    harpists used to recite centuries of clan lines in song.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, inside the house did you sit around in the evening or
                        dinner time and discuss matters of the world?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: Only by accident. Our family table was often chaotic: sibling glares,
                    parents who fought operatically, one sister who would secretly drop food under
                    the table, me who ate everything like a starving prisoner. Although thanks in no
                    small part to my mother, we did sit down together. I remember my father was an
                    active reader. Ed loved Joseph Conrad, detective books, O. Henry novels. But his
                    job was very intellectually demanding. He left at 4 a.m. to take the early train
                    to NYC and was tired when he came home. So when TV was invented, he loved that
                    way of relaxing and reconnecting with culture and current events. We used to
                    have the TV on while we were eating dinner, which got my goat. It used to broil
                    me that we couldn't have a conversation about “the world.” The exception was at
                    holiday time when the house was full of relatives. Those scenes were like a
                    wacky New York version of Dylan Thomas' “Christmas in Wales.”</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>I worked for my Dad two summers in college, and I loved getting a look at his
                    craft. He had treated me as an adult from early on. But I didn't find out how
                    good he was until later. He used to go to Washington and have to do all the
                    research himself, writing by hand in the old Patent Office and being nice to the
                    old clerks who'd bring the files out and might know where the pertinent secrets
                    were stored. He was licensed to argue before the Supreme Court, and he never
                    lost a case in patent court. Melville's CEO called him the “Rolls Royce of
                    patent attorneys.” For a couple of years in the 1950s, Dad partnered with
                    another attorney, and after they went separate ways he kept the sign, “Jones and
                    Roe.” This attracted many patent-seekers from the Afro-American community, who
                    thought from the name that he must be a “brother.” Ed's heart was with the small
                    inventors who came up with unique, often quixotic ideas to make life better. His
                    drive came from getting them their just due. And struggling to pay our college
                    tuitions.</p>
                <p>Dad's younger brother, Frederick Stevens Roe (Roger) was killed in Burma in July
                    1944. He was a second lieutenant in the infantry during World War II. Ed never
                    quite got over this loss. He had also tried to enlist in the army, but a serious
                    hockey injury kept him out. That weighed on him. He spent much of his free time
                    during the war years visiting injured soldiers in the hospitals.</p>
                <p>My mother knit together the family strands. Eloise held our genealogy in the map
                    of her mind and could recall the most intricate family relationships with an
                    immediacy that still awes me. She would look after neglected parts of the flock
                    just as she cared for stray animals. My great uncle and aunt, Leighton and Edith
                    Rogers, lived in Greenwich, Connecticut. We visited them a lot, and they would
                    come see us every holiday. Leighton was my first window into international
                    service. He lived with his sister in a small, beautifully furnished apartment
                    with oriental rugs and antiques brought back from Russia and China. I have a
                    lacquered jade green box that he carved my initials into, and a small,
                    well-worn, laughing wooden Buddha that carries his essence. Their apartment in
                    Greenwich was so inviting and resonant, like an open book or a sonata.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>Uncle Leighton went to work in Russia for one of the first multinational ventures
                    when National City Bank of New York (now Citibank) opened their offices in
                    pre-Revolutionary Russia under the czar in 1914. He graduated from Dartmouth
                    College and was recruited to join this mission with other Dartmouth graduates
                    who spoke not a word of Russian. They went straight from Dartmouth to Saint
                    Petersburg in 1916. They studied Russian assiduously throughout their stay. They
                    were culture vultures, real adventurers. Leighton's diary is a vivid chronicle
                    of Russia in full collapse. He and his colleagues lived in the heart of the
                    capital, near the palace. They witnessed the overthrow of the czar and the
                    Bolshevik revolution. In Leighton's journaand his dinner table stories - he made
                    feel you were right there on the turbulent streets of St. Petersburg, seeing
                    Lenin and Trotsky talk, observing Rasputin, watching the starving soldiers
                    return from the front. He and his friends went to every opera and ballet they
                    could afford. They explored the city, took memorable side trips, and experienced
                    the famine first hand. The Bolsheviks took over Citibank for a period of about
                    three weeks and held them hostage. Leighton engaged the revolutionaries in
                    heated debate. Soon after, they put Leighton's name on a hit list. The bank's
                    home office agreed to let him leavhe wanted to enlist in the U.S. army because
                    his brother Lester had just enlisted. But getting out of Russia was a conundrum.
                    He was granted one visa to leave Russia but couldn't get the one that was
                    required to leave Saint Petersburg. The U.S. Consul was risk-adverse and
                    wouldn't help him. The British understood the urgency and helped organize an
                    escape expedition for expats including Leighton whose lives were in danger. To
                    get aboard the train, he did an end run around the border guards in the St.
                    Petersburg railroad station. His friends created a ruckus to distract the
                    police, and then threw his bags over the guards' heads while he made a running
                    jump for the train. With the rations his friends had donated, he barely survived
                    the freezing train to Murmansk, the Russian city bordering Finland that was then
                    controlled by the Western powers. When Leighton arrived in London, he approached
                    the first group of officers he saw standing on the street to ask for help. To
                    his amazement, one of them was his older brother (our grandfather) Lester, who
                    was assigned to work with the British as an army surgeon.</p>
                <p>Leighton enlisted and served in army intelligence for the American Expeditionary
                    Forces in England and France in 1918 and 1919. Sometime after the war he
                    barnstormed across the country with his cohorts, showing off the new flying
                    machines.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>Leighton published a well-received novel, Wine of Fury, about Americans caught up
                    in the Russian revolution. He joined the Foreign Commercial Service, serving as
                    trade commissioner in Warsaw and Berlin. From 1926 to 1933 he was the first CEO
                    of the U.S. Aeronautical Society. In that capacity he went on an expedition to
                    China. The small aircraft carrying his group went down in one of the tributaries
                    of the Yangtze River, but the passengers survived. During World War Two he led a
                    technical mission to Russia and advised Bell Aircraft on Russian capabilities.
                    (John Haynes, the Library of Congress' American historian, learned during a
                    recent trip to Siberia that the KGB had checked on Leighton's credentials prior
                    to the Bell Aircraft mission. To their surprise, they found he wasn't a spy!)
                    After World War II, Leighton tried to survive as a writer and consultant, but it
                    didn't pan out. When his sister Edith, a schoolteacher died, it was a month or
                    so too early for Leighton to receive her pension. He died in 1962 of cirrhosis
                    of the liver. My uncle was a great raconteur. His joie de vivre and his
                    vulnerability made a lasting impression. His example taught me that working as
                    an artist will not magically put bread on the table. That voice helped me tough
                    it out in a line of work that at times seemed diametrically opposed to my
                    nature, or to any free spirit.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: Both were independent-minded. To the extent there was any political
                    discussion at home, my mother and father would take opposing sides, on
                    principle. My father preferred the Democrats. His instinct was for the underdog
                    and for fair play. He was outraged by the McCarthy hysteria and the unfairness
                    of the House Un-American Committee hearings. My mother called herself a
                    Republican. However, the last time she voted for a Republican was for
                    Eisenhower, because she thought the party had forgotten how to keep government
                    out of the bedroom. She said conservatives talked about right to life but didn't
                    care about women's health or about the rights of children who lived in hard
                    circumstances. She was very much of a feminist and had strong opinions about
                    most everything. She was most outraged by the religious fanatics who wanted to
                    insert their polemics into the school system. She was allergic to Democrats, but
                    in practice saw them as the lesser of two evils. Contradictions didn't faze her
                    — she named Eleanor Roosevelt one of her main heroines. I remember her saying
                    during her last days in hospice that it's well nigh time the U.S. had a woman
                    President, and Hillary Clinton would make a fine Commander in Chief, and why

                <p>ROE: I loved fairy tales and animal stories. I devoured books about horses,
                    especially those written by C.W. Anderson, an artist friend of my Dad's. As a
                    teen I read Walt Whitman, Dylan Thomas, Federica Garcia Lorca, Rilke. From
                    Lorcand later in college reading George Orwell — I learned about the Spanish
                    Civil War. After high school I was drawn to Anna Akhmatova, the Russian poet who
                    died in the Russian Gulag. Albert Camus, Rachel Carson, Edna St. Vincent Millay,
                    Hemingway, and Robert Frost were other favorites. Zen Buddhism fascinated
                    me.</p>
                <p>Pleasantville was an older commuter town, but it had its homely charms. The main
                    immigrant community was Italian. I befriended the cemetery keeper, an ancient
                    gentleman with a nearly full-length beard, who shared many stories with me.
                    Harry Belafonte lived in the rolling hills beyond the center of town. One summer
                    at Tarbell Farms, I found a stack of old Reader's Digest magazines in the attic.
                    I started reading about the Holocaust and I was shocked. I felt somehow the
                    adults had betrayed me by their silence. Why did nobody talk about it in high
                    school? Why wasn't it part of our history studies? I was sickened that genocide
                    could occur and have such a horrible, devastating impact on a whole continent,
                    on all humanity. I read about the Nazis, the French Resistance movement, and
                    other upheavals like the Soviet invasion of Hungary in 1956. Later in college I
                    learned about the occupation and maiming of Tibet by Communist China. These
                    tragedies felt personal to me. I vowed whatever I did with my life, I wouldn't
                    be silent in the face of injustice. I had to be engaged.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: Pleasantville has a Jewish community, Usonia, that was inspired by the
                    architecture of Franklin Lloyd Wright. My closest friend, Lucy Resnik, lived
                    there. She was a year ahead of me in high school and we shared a love of poetry.
                    I liked being around her folks, hearing their intense discussions about politics
                    and seeing the candles they would light during the high holidays. I wasn't aware
                    of any anti-Semitism in the school. I did sense discrimination toward
                    lower-income groups and didn't like it at all. I was both insider and outsider,
                    at one point being cheerleading captain and head of the women's basketball team.
                    My circles were very eclectic. Another best friend from grammar school was
                    Sheila Marvin (now Mack). We've kept in touch over the yearSheila married a
                    foreign service officer, Jim Mack, and briefly lived in my place in Greenwich
                    Village after college. In high school I hung out with working-class pals, with
                    eggheads and the usual for-fun gang of girls. When we were kids, as a treat, Dad
                    would take the family out to the diner, which we called the “bean wagon.” But
                    later in high school he'd warn us, “don't go near the bean wagon,” because the
                    motorcycle crowd hung out there at night. So of course being in love with Jimmy

                <p>ROE: I would head for the diner to see what they had to say. I was a tomboy. When
                    I was in grade school, my older sister Becky had a group that would make up
                    mysterious Arthurian feats in the woods, and back then we could play there all
                    day, with nobody fretting about it. The big girls would put logs across the
                    water and cross them, and go hide out. I followed them like a little puppy dog
                    and tried to keep up. My father was the acting police judge of the town. Once
                    with my local gang we broke into the village pool at night by climbing over a
                    big fence. None of the kids told their parents that we'd gotten caught. Well, I
                    told my parents because I knew my father would find out right away. Without
                    deserving it, I gained a sort of rough halo that he heard from me first.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about academically, the high school and in elementary
                        school. What sort of subjects did you cotton to or which ones weren't you
                        happy with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: I loved music. I sang my heart out in chorus. (Later in college, I wanted to
                    be a jazz singer.) I studied the piano, but never enjoyed recitals. My least
                    favorite subject was home economics which girls had to take in middle schooI
                    nearly flunked it. I loved art and sketching horses. I was mad about horses and
                    all kinds of magical creatures. I conversed with unicorns. I loved literature.
                    Among the schoolteachers that most influenced me was our French teacher,
                    Monsieur Gabriel. I had four years of college-level French in high school. Mr.
                    Gabriel used to tell me not to drag my feet on the floor or my mind would
                    suffer. He was strict, with an impish sense of humor. We had term papers, and I
                    remember more than one meltdown trying to get them done in English or in French.
                    I liked history, not memorizing dates, but interpreting social movements and
                    ideas. I was good at math and enjoyed it like a game, but forgot everything once
                    I no longer studied it. At one point when I was negotiating union contracts, I
                    had to teach myself all over again how to get fractions: divide the larger
                    number into the smaller one. So math didn't stick, but political/cultural
                    issues, the arts, philosophy, the fascination with social changthose
                    remained.</p>

                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>ROE: My sister Noel, ten years my elder, studied at Colby Jr. College, now Colby
                    Sawyer College in New London, New Hampshire. Right after graduating she drove to
                    California to visit our grandfather Lester Rogers. On her return she explored
                    Colorado and stayed there permanently, living in the Rockies in Fraser, near
                    Winter Park. She was the pioneer. Becky, my high school idol, was two and a half
                    years older than me and she followed suit going to the University of Colorado.
                    My mother drove me out to visit her on the Easter spring break two years before
                    I was to go to college. Mother loved the freedom of getting in the car and
                    driving across the country. When I saw the Rocky Mountains jutting out of the
                    plains, it was an epiphany. I was mesmerized. I sat in on several of Becky's
                    classes. The American lit teacher was discussing John Dos Passos and when he
                    read the words — “While there's a working class, I am of it...While there's a
                    soul in prison, I am not free”— I thought, this is where I'm going to study. So
                    I applied to one college and one alone —the University of Colorado. Mom wanted
                    me to go to one of the Seven Sister colleges. I had top grades and could have
                    had many interesting choices. But when I met the women coming back from those
                    colleges, they looked overdressed, stressed out, all of one mold, not like the
                    people I'd met out West who seemed very relaxed, free, like pioneers. So I went
                    to CU. Later my younger sister Anne also attended Colby Jr. and moved to
                    Colorado after finishing her degree at the University of Denver. We are cowboy
                    girls at heart.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: A place in ferment. Boulder was a stimulating town intellectually, socially,
                    and sports-wise. CU was a large campus but easy to find your way around. I
                    didn't take to dormitory life. After my first year I took a few classes in
                    summer school, aiming to get through college early. My college roommatAlexandra
                    McArdle (now Ogsbury) and I broke the rules by getting our own flat. The school
                    authorities later discovered this and gave us a slap on the wrists. Alexandra
                    and I continued as roommates in Robinson's boarding house after freshman year
                    and we remain the closest of buddies, lifetimes later. She became a modern

                    her daughter.</p>
                <p>I gravitated towards two areas of study, political sociology and languages. I
                    loved the French language, and there were some Normandy roots in my mother's
                    family. One of her ancestors on her father's side was the John Rogers who
                    published the first English translation of the Bible in Antwerp and was burned
                    at the stake for heresy in 1555.</p>

                <p>ROE: Who paid dearly. France had this connection for me, and I loved the sound of
                    Romance languages. The head of CU's French Department was a visionary professor,
                    Pierre Delattre. He had a whole mad scientist setup in the basement with a
                    futuristic recording studio. He taught French like music, emphasizing phonetics,
                    tonalities, articulation. I worked in the university language lab, took graduate
                    level French, and studied Russian and Polish which I now realize echoed my great
                    uncle's overseas experiences. I would have majored in sociology, but the
                    required courses struck me as boring and irrelevant in the extreme. A political
                    sociology professor, Alex Gardner, was the center of political debate and action
                    on campus. He was a democrat socialist, deeply immersed in the historical
                    debates of the Mensheviks and the Bolsheviks as well as the political issues of
                    the '60s. He took on the pro-Communist left and the right wingers. His
                    adversaries included Edward Teller, who had opposed the nuclear test ban treaty,
                    and those taken up with the Ayn Rand cult—</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: And forget about community. Alex Garber was the faculty guru for the Young
                    People's Socialist League (YPSL), the youth group of the Norman Thomas Socialist
                    Party. I gravitated to that group. I became their recording secretary. We
                    opposed dictatorship, whether the brand was right or left-wing. We had members
                    like Bob Martin who fought in Castro's revolution when it was idealistic. They
                    came back and told us about life in the hills with the revolutionaries, and what
                    happened when Castro turned against his own people. Professor Garber taught
                    courses on Soviet society and the sociology of modern political movements. He
                    theorized that with the emergence of the European Union the Soviet Union was
                    doomed, because Europe with its open society would become a political-economic
                    magnet for its neighbors to the East. He thought the model of free societies
                    along with the popular movements building up inside the Soviet bloc would
                    undermine the totalitarian state from within, and that soft power would bring
                    about its demise more effectively than military confrontation. That was pretty
                    far-sighted for the 1960s. The YPSLs were political junkies. They followed the
                    Cuban missile crisis the way kids today follow video games. They coached other
                    political groups on campus, including the young Republicans and others with whom
                    we disagreed, and were shamelessly creative about raising money.</p>
                <p>Penn Kemble was a leading light. We were comrades-in-arms, never romantically
                    involved, although he once proposed going out with me. I wanted to stay friends
                    instead. I looked up to Penn but was didn't share his penchant for ferocious
                    intellectual debates. I dated Loren Jenkins, who was two years ahead of me.
                    Loren joined the Peace Corps and went to Sierra Leone. We didn't see each other
                    again for decades. He became a prize-winning foreign correspondent and is now
                    senior international editor at National Public Radio. I was an awful pen-pal.
                    But his letters from West Africa piqued my interest in international
                    development.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>On the CU campus Penn headed an underground film club. He ran avant garde films,
                    charged admission for them and channeled the take into the YPSL slush fund. We
                    made home brewed beer with giant tube-filling contraptions. With the beer we'd
                    throw huge campus parties to rake in money for the cause. During the heyday of
                    the civil rights movement, we registered people to vote both on campus and in
                    low-income parts of Boulder. I spent my third year of college in France at the
                    Sorbonne, eventually dropping out of classes to join the jazz scene. I had
                    planned to stay in Paris through the summer of 1963. Then I heard about the
                    murder of Medgar Evers, the Birmingham bombings, and Kennedy's decision to send
                    troops to buck Bull Conner in Birmingham. With that news I returned to the U.S.
                    in June. I attended summer school and helped organize a busload from campus to
                    participate in the March on Washington.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was led by Martin Luther King.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: Yes, I heard Dr. King deliver his “I Have a Dream” speech on the Mall. It
                    was a stirring time. Penn had graduated a year before me and was working out of
                    the March on Washington headquarters. He was an aide to Bayard Rustin, King's
                    executive director for the March. The logistics coordinator was another
                    Socialist colleague, Rachelle Horowitz, who became Political Director of the
                    American Federation of Teachers (AFT). Years later, Rachelle married Tom
                    Donahue, the Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO. Other members included Tom
                    Kahn, who replaced Irving Brown as AFL-CIO International Director; Sandra
                    Feldman, who was to become AFT President; and Paul Feldman, who edited the
                    socialist newspaper New America.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: I thought his foreign policy approaches were visionary — his identification
                    with national independence movements, his understanding of how poverty warps
                    development, his outreach to Latin America, his initiatives to overcome the arms
                    race. I can still hear his “Ich bin ein Berliner” speech. The Kennedy brothers
                    both imprinted my life. I was skeptical about the Democratic party, but I liked
                    their frankness, their mixture of idealism and existential realism. It was a
                    time of great hope for change. The assassinations of Jack and Bobby Kennedy and
                    Martin Luther King felt to me like a death in the family, a black hole. I count
                    among my sacred places the shrine to JFK and RFK at Arlington National Cemetery,
                    the Mall in front of the Capital where King spoke and the Lincoln Memorial with
                    the words of the Gettysburg Address etched into the stone. The lives and
                    sacrifice of those leaders were so closely connected.</p>

                <p>ROE: Oh, it did. Those who joined the Peace Corps were his happy warriors. JFK
                    ignited the spirit of service for my generation. My political influences were
                    very eclectic. Marx's early, less dogmatic, essays were kind of interesting, but
                    I gravitated to pragmatists like Sidney Hook. Hook was deeply committed to
                    democratic principles and a great educator. He once said what every government
                    needs is a “Ministry of Irritation.” His views on creative, informative
                    journalism and education were radical for his time. Others who inspired me

                    servicemen and women. Michael Harrington wrote The Other America, which focused
                    a spotlight on the issue of poverty and social injustice in the U.S. In the
                    1960s, the SDS (Students for a Democratic Society) was on the rise. The SDSers
                    became archrivals. We thought they were in denial about oppressive regimes of
                    the left. All the big issues were mirrored at the University of Colorado.</p>

                    graduating, I helped start an organization, Frontlash, which aimed to counter
                    the backlash through political education and participation — the Goldwater
                    campaign was emerging and right wingers were mobilizing to turn the clock back
                    on racial equality and the New Deal. We wanted to see the impetus of the civil
                    rights movement spur more young people to vote and help change their
                    communities. We got students involved in reaching out to members of labor
                    unions, minorities, and poor people who were disenfranchised because of
                    restrictive voter registration requirements or voter apathy. “From Protest to
                    Politics” was the name of a pamphlet written for the March on Washington by
                    Bayard Rustin and Tom Kahn,. The idea was to hone your political know-how in
                    local communities, working with labor unions, church and community
                    organizations, strengthening the coalitions of conscience that fueled the civil
                    rights movement. We focused on marginal Congressional districts where those
                    activities could make a difference.</p>

                    particularly in El Paso, in Corpus Christi, San Antonio. In Los Angeles,

                    Director for the U.S. Youth Council, which included College Young Democrats,

                    the Youth Council and the Stern Family Fund, Penn Kemble and I founded
                    Frontlash. From 1967-74, I doubled as Executive Director and Field Director.
                    David Jessup, who later became Associate Political Director of the AFL-CIO, was
                    Western Coast director, and Penn chaired the Board and developed relationships

                <p>ROE: Oh yes, among students, intellectuals, Northern Africans and other immigrant
                    communities. A visiting professor at CU, Jean Marie Domenach, edited Esprit, a
                    progressive Catholic journal. He invited me to his editorial shop in Paris and
                    to meetings of his circle, which met at his home outside Paris. I wrote a few
                    articles for Esprit about the intellectual ferment within the student and peace
                    movements in the U.S.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>I had gone to Paris without an organized program, which could never happen today.
                    I enrolled at the Sorbonne at the L'�cole Superieur pour l'Enseignement de
                    Francais a l'Ext�rieure, a college for teaching French abroad. Before long I
                    found the classes were completely alienating. I sat in cavernous halls with some
                    monumentally boring lecturer up there talking to the air, not engaging the
                    students in any way, no question and answer. I wanted to explore Paris on my own
                    and explore my fantasy of being a singer. I tutored English on the side. I got
                    to know several of the many American jazz musicians living therthe bassist Willy
                    Dixon, blues singer Memphis Slim, tenor saxophonist Johnny Griffin. I sang in
                    taverns and busked in London. What I recall about Paris is the buzzing,
                    evocative street life, the immigrants from China or East Africa living on
                    shoestrings near the Left Bank, the prickly concierges, the nourishing student
                    cafeterias, the underground museum of the Nazi resistance movement near Notre
                    Dame cathedral, the stories each building would tell, the storefronts and cafes
                    and evocative book stalls along the Seine. Two great cities, Paris and London —
                    I barely scratched the surface, but they wore off on me. The social and artistic
                    ferment was very big. Opposition to the Algerian war was building.</p>

                    Paris is where I came closer to a Bohemian existence. But the sleazy atmosphere
                    in nightclubs turned me away from a jazz career. Once at CU I did experiment
                    with peyote up in the mountains.</p>

                    in the group that night. I was the only one who didn't get sick. I saw Indian
                    tapestries, people's eyes like pin needles of light, blades of grass becoming
                    barking dogs. I danced and sang rock, anything that came into my head, and
                    wondered why everyone else sat around looking morose. The next day the bounce
                    was gone. So I said, that's the limit.</p>

                    took on prominent roles in organizations and pushed me into leadership positions
                    I wouldn't have sought on my own. The environmental movement was also starting

                    machine, knowing that if I did that, I would be stuck in that dark, grimy room -
                    the dregs.</p>

                <p>ROE: From there I became business manager for the socialist newspaper New
                    America. In 1966 I was Youth Affairs Consultant with the New York Friends Group,
                    headed by Robert Gilmore. Charlie Bloomstein was Treasurer of this independent
                    Quaker organization. The Friends supported Bayard Rustin in his many missions.
                    Within two years Frontlash took shape, and we got short-term funding from the
                    AFL-CIO for voter registration projects in the 1968 elections. After the
                    elections, I returned to my job with the Friends group and became National
                    Secretary for the Young People's Socialist League, an unpaid position. Carl
                    Gershman, who's now Director of the National Endowment for Democracy, was then
                    Chairman of the Social Democrats USA, the adult affiliate. One day I got a call
                    from Lane Kirkland, Secretary-Treasurer of the AFL-CIO. He said, somewhat
                    mysteriously, “Let's meet.” I asked Penn to come with me and we met in a bar
                    near his hotel. Kirkland knew I was involved in YPSL. He wanted to explore a
                    partnership with Frontlash and was interested in recruiting young staff to the
                    AFL-CIO. He recounted how he attended the Georgetown School of Foreign Service
                    after running away at age sixteen to join the Merchant Marines. At that point,
                    besides a successful voter drive in California, Frontlash had been active in
                    Texas when Ralph Yarborough ran for reelection to the Senate.</p>

                <p>ROE: Right, but we weren't working with Democratic organizations or advocating
                    specific candidates. In most of these communities, the Democratic establishment
                    was not that interested in opening up voter registration because while it might
                    help them elect people to Congress, it was going to give them trouble locally.
                    They weren't our natural allies. In Texas, we cooperated with operatives like
                    Tyrus Fain, former Bobby Kennedy campaign leaders who had parallel efforts in
                    the field.</p>

                <p>ROE: Yes, they were supporting Senator Yarborough and Sissy Farenthold, who later
                    ran for Governor. I came back in 1970 and trained local activists for another
                    voter education drive in San Antonio, Corpus Christi and El Paso, Texas. Back
                    then, citizens had to register by March in order to vote in a November election.
                    The rules were rigged to disenfranchise the poor.</p>
                <p>Several other projects got me started in international spheres. I represented
                    Frontlash in a Trans-Atlantic Alliance conference organized by Georgetown
                    University professor Roy Godard. I was Student Coordinator for an International
                    Observation Mission that monitored elections in the Dominican Republic the year
                    after the precipitous 1965 U.S. invasion of that country. Juan Bosch was running
                    for President again and had put out a call for impartial observers. This was the
                    brainchild of Al Lowenthal, a liberal anti-war activist in New York, and Penn,
                    and the delegation included Norman Thomas, Walter Reuther, political science
                    experts and community leaders. I worked with the Mission in Santo Domingo for
                    three months. After the elections, I stayed on to complete the reports. The head
                    of the DR's human rights commission, Marta Martinez, who was nominally our ally
                    while secretly working for Balaguer, stole our key documents. I refused to leave
                    the country until she returned them. We got them back and the observers' reports
                    were published in book form. The 1966 mission was the first international
                    election observation project of its kind. Ten years after that, the SDUSA sent a
                    youth delegation to Israel that was organized by the Israeli Labor party.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: The aim was to explore the challenges faced by the Labor Party and Israeli
                    society. The SDUSA was a very small party but a participating member of the
                    Socialist International, which includes all the labor parties of Europe. Israel
                    was isolated in international fora and wanted to build support for their
                    perspective. This was a 10-day whirlwind tour. I was impressed by the
                    Arab-Israeli members of parliament, by the young sabras (Israeli-born citizens),
                    soldiers and activists we met, by the history evident at every turn and the
                    unforgettable venueJerusalem, Ein Gedi, Masada, the shores of Galilee. It was an
                    intact Israel, one that hadn't been eroded by decades of acting as an occupying
                    power. There was hope for inter-ethnic reconciliation. There was hope the
                    Israeli democratic experiment could catch on in the Middle East.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: I like what European social democrats have done on quality of life issuea
                    government that cares about the environment; national health insurance and
                    daycare systems; respect for unions as economic partners; a more equitable
                    distribution of social benefits; rural development that preserves small towns
                    and historical architecture and landscapes. I never subscribed to the capitalist
                    faith that the market knows all. But in foreign affairs, it struck me that our
                    European counterparts — like the business community in general — were too
                    accommodating towards the Soviets. Why not face human rights issues squarely
                    instead of dining with tyrants and executioners?</p>
                <p>Now, defining socialism was always an elusive thing for me, like a labyrinth. The
                    factional divisions that led to Michael Harrington splitting away from SDUSA in
                    1972 were beyond my ken. I was always adverse to doctrinal feuds and abstract
                    arguments. When I started working with trade unions in the field, I realized how
                    much ideology closes you off to dialogue and to plain everyday reality. What
                    means something to me is — what are you doing to right the wrongs you see, to
                    heal the earth and help make life better for people and other species? It's
                    about dignity and good stewardship and self-determination and these have no

                    1960s and '70s was a real straightjacket. For example in the later period of the
                    civil rights movement when the Black Power people emerged, Bayard Rustin was
                    vilified by many for defending racial integration. During his debates against
                    media luminaries like Stokely Carmichael, the militants booed Bayard for
                    proposing to work non-violently within the democratic system. Imagine the
                    thought! Bayard was a prophetic activist who brought the Gandhian philosophy and
                    practice of non-violence to the civil rights movement. He was a key mentor to
                    Martin Luther King, and in his later years he openly advocated gay rights.
                    Bayard and Max Shachtman were mentors for the New York City cadre. Bayard's life
                    was documented in a 2002 PBS film, Brother Outsider. Leading the first bus
                    protests in the 1940s, he said “what we need are angelic troublemakers.”</p>

                <p>One of the radical acts I'm proudest of was being jailed for protesting the 1968
                    Soviet invasion of Czechoslovakia, when Brezhnev crushed the Prague Spring. We
                    wanted to raise Cain about the intervention and show the Czechs they had friends
                    worldwide who identified with their plight. In Washington D.C., demonstrators
                    couldn't get anywhere near the Soviet embassy. Tass News Agency in New York City
                    was a softer target. I headed the sit-in brigade that included Helen Toth, who's
                    now an international rep for the American Federation of Teachers. We knocked on
                    the door and said we had a student press release to discuss. When the
                    unsuspecting staffers let us in, we announced we were sitting in to protest the
                    Soviet occupation of Czechoslovakia, and insisted that they run our declaration
                    over their wire service. We started singing civil rights songs and kept up the
                    sit-in for five hours. Finally the police came, and they very nicely said,
                    “We'll have to arrest you. But if you leave peacefully, that won't be
                    necessary.” We said, “Well, we're sorry but we think you'll have to arrest us.”
                    The four of uall girls — spent the night in jail in a cell with the hookers.
                    That was scary at first, but the ladies of the night respected our space. I
                    remember dozing off on a hard bench after eating a baloney sandwich. The next
                    day representatives from the Russian embassy came and said they were dropping
                    the charges against us. We'd already gotten a front page article in the New York
                    Times. That was our goal. Short of drastic social action, nobody in the press
                    wanted to hear anything besides Vietnam. To most of the left, that was the only
                    evil of note in the world and we thought the war shouldn't overshadow other
                    injustices.</p>
                <p>In June, 1987, I visited the Czechoslovakia when my sister Becky's son Landis
                    married a young Czech skier, Ivana Valesova. They had met in Bulgaria in 1982
                    and again as competitors in the Sarajevo Olympic games. We went to the wedding.
                    It was a little over a year before the Velvet Revolution, and when I told the
                    younger members of the family I had gone to jail for a free Czechoslovakia,
                    their eyes opened real wide. In early 1989 Miro Vales, Ivana's brother, sent me
                    a beautiful letter recounting his role in the student protests that sparked the
                    Velvet Revolution. During the 1987 trip, I could see that the youth of Central
                    Eastern Europe were already involved in a silent, invisible uprising. They
                    adored James Dean. They identified with rock and roll and retro American culture
                    as a way of expressing their total rejection of the system. We were kindred
                    spirits. The secret police hovering around us on that trip only heightened the
                    connection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then you were involved with AFL-CIO. How long did
                        that last?</hi>

                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>ROE: The first step was in 1969, when Lane Kirkland helped us put Frontlash back
                    on the map. When I was ready to move on from Frontlash, I worked for the
                    International Ladies Garment Workers Union as they opened a Washington office in
                    1974. I joined Evelyn Dubrow, their chief lobbyist, as a legislative
                    representative. Evelyn was then in her late '60's, and coveted her position as a
                    diva on the Hill. She wasn't big on delegating. Still, I learned a thing or two.
                    I also worked as a consultant for Ed Carlough, the Sheet Metal Workers
                    President, to help start a women's political action program. In 1975, Don
                    Slaiman, Deputy Director of Organization for AFL-CIO, asked me to join that
                    division. It wasn't what I hoped for. I badly wanted to staff the international
                    affairs or legislative department. But AFL-CIO's priority was to counter the
                    membership decline unions had been suffering. I was hired as field
                    representative for the Washington D.C., Maryland, Delaware and Virginia region.
                    A vacancy emerged in Central Ohio while I was in my six-month training and
                    probation period. To my dismay I was shipped to Ohio, while Kevin Kistler, the
                    son of the department director, was hired to represent the D.C. metropolitan
                    area.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You worked for them for how long?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: I worked for AFL-CIO for seven years, until 1983. At first I felt like I was
                    in exile being in Ohio, but the place and the people grew on me. I had a
                    spread-out, mostly rural territory, and was constantly learning new skills. I
                    leased a new car every two years. My boss was 400 miles away in Baltimore. What
                    more could you ask? During my last year as a field representative, AFL-CIO was
                    experimenting with grassroots lobbying. I set up breakfast meetings for union
                    leaders to talk issues with our elected representatives. The facsimile machine,
                    a predecessor of the slick, quick fax we know today, was just coming into use. A
                    day before the meeting, I'd receive a long, messy fax with the talking points
                    hard to read through the smeared ink. I worked with a large network of Central
                    Labor Councils to inform them about AFL-CIO programs, get them engaged in
                    political education and help them solve their community-level problems. I
                    represented a directly affiliated union near Sandusky, Ohio. Occasionally the
                    AFL-CIO sent me out of state on organizing campaigns.</p>
                <p>My biggest success was advising the campaign to organize the white-collar workers
                    in the Pittsburgh Press. During the previous decade, AFL-CIO had been defeated
                    there in three previous elections. For six months I collaborated with the local
                    Newspaper Guild, directly recruited organizers within the sales and clerical
                    divisions and coached them. We won in 1979, largely due to great shop leaders
                    and strong support from the local News Guild and the national Typographical
                    Union (ITU). We had our own “deep throat.” The Press's personnel director
                    silently sympathized with our goals and gave us good leads. Sadly, a year after
                    the election, Elaine Cirocco, the lead organizer and shop chair of the new
                    bargaining unit, was brutally murdered in downtown Pittsburgh. She was killed in
                    a mugging incident as she left the union hall one night. I wrote a poem for the
                    ITU newspaper about Elaine. Her killing was unfathomable to me, such a loss.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Every two years the Ohio AFL-CIO, which gave me office space and secretarial
                    support, would assign me to coordinate a congressional district in Ohio to spur
                    get-out-the-vote campaigns and to build coalitions on political issues. My
                    district was the 10th which spanned most of southern Ohio. Ted Strickland, a
                    reform-minded Democrat, was running for Congress, and he kept losing but by less
                    and less. He persevered, eventually winninafter I had left Ohiand later became
                    governor.</p>
                <p>My main frustration was that Ohio was about as far away as you could get from the
                    international arena. New York City is practically a world city. I had worked
                    with dissidents from Eastern Europe and identified with their cause. At one
                    point I took Milovan Djilas of Yugoslavia around the city. I missed that
                    international vantage point. At one point I thought of applying for a job with
                    the CIA — I had an interview in Cincinnati and was asked to do follow up testing
                    in Washington. But I couldn't imagine taking on a profession I'd have to hide
                    from my family and friends. I was in the process of getting a divorce from my
                    second husband, Tom Mellars. I had been accepted as an M.A. candidate at Ohio
                    State University in Columbus. Serendipitously, I got a call from my former
                    sister-in-law, Eugenia Kemble, with whom I'd stayed in close contact as she
                    became International Director for the AFT. She said, “Charlotte, they need a
                    person like you in the State Department because the labor attach� for Paris has
                    just resigned.” She thought I'd be a natural because I knew French. I contacted
                    John Warnock who then headed State's international labor division. John said,
                    “Oh, you'd be great” after we talked and he saw my CV. He was very encouraging.
                    Alone, I wouldn't have applied in a million years, but John walked me through. I
                    asked, “Well, how do I study for the exam?” He said, “With your political
                    experience, just brush up by reading Newsweek. That'll do you fine.”</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: The end of 1981. A small window had opened for recruiting women and minority
                    candidates for lateral entry as mid-level officers. I submitted my published
                    articles and was given a date for the exams. In my oral test, the interview team
                    knew a lot about my background, asked about a range of issues and subjects — how
                    I'd handle specific duty-officer scenarios, civil rights practices in Ohio,
                    French writers, the Marshall Plan, U.S. policy in Tunisia. I pointed out how the
                    U.S. had been supportive of the liberation movements in Northern Africa in sharp
                    contrast to our policies in Vietnam. I scored well and was accepted quickly, but
                    the security clearance was so slow I never counted on anything. After eight
                    months I made a Freedom of Information Act request and received the whole file.
                    It reads like a book of my life from the perspective the interviewees. I'd
                    spoken frankly with the FBI about my experiences in the socialist movement, my
                    wild days at CU and abroad. They talked with my farm neighbors. One had
                    mentioned that I had brought a pie to honor a farmer down the road who had
                    passed away. Rachelle Horowitz and other movement activists are quoted. The file
                    is that detailed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: I was a political officer although my labor experience was considered an
                    asset. In A100 class, my advisors said to forget about going to a
                    French-speaking country unless it was in Africa. Most of the opportunities they
                    had for political officers were in Latin America. Still, the job that interested
                    me was assistant labor attach� in Rome, and I was about to be paneled for Rome.
                    Then I met the labor attach� who was serving in Rome. Fortunately for me, we had
                    an instant, mutual chemical aversion. He struck me as the perfect State
                    Department stiff. I suppose he saw me as an alien from Mars. I remember going to
                    see Bob Gelbard, who then headed personnel for the European division, and I
                    said, “I'm about to be paneled for Rome and I just changed my mind.” He said,
                    “Are you absolutely crazy?” I said, “Yes, I want to go to La Paz instead.” He
                    said, “La Paz is the one place in the world that I would give up Rome for.”
                    Gelbard had been a Peace Corps officer in La Paz. He said, “It's crazy, but
                    you're doing the right thing because that's a real job and you'll be fascinated.
                    It's one of the few places in the world that's really a foreign country.” So
                    that's what I did.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: I married Penn Kemble four years after college. We had not gone together at
                    CU, but our work in NYC brought us into close quarters. We lived together off
                    and on and eventually tied the knot in 1968. We were married for six years, but
                    our temperaments led to a distancing early on. Penn moved to Washington in 1972.
                    We briefly reconciled then divorced in 1974. I stayed on fairly good terms with
                    Penn and was close to his family. Why turn away from a family that becomes part
                    of your life? A few years later Penn remarried to a delightful woman,
                    Marie-Louise Caravatti. He became Deputy Director of USIA under President
                    Clinton. In late 2004 Penn suffered a brain tumor and died in October 2005.
                    Penn's friends from the movement days often met at his bedside to cheer him (and
                    ourselves) during his last year. I played the harp, his brother Grover played
                    guitar and we sang all the songs of the 60s and 70s. Penn somehow straddled the
                    neo-conservative camp and those in the liberal realms. We didn't see eye to eye
                    politically, especially about the Iraq war. His last efforts were to spur
                    dialogue among democratic left and labor intellectuals. His death left quite a
                    gap. Even President George W. Bush honored his passing.</p>

                <p>ROE: He would have liked that, but it was too late. In 1977 I remarried, a year
                    after moving to Ohio for the AFL-CIO. My husband, Tom Mellars, was a Korean war
                    veteran who headed the Glass Bottle Blowers union in Newark, Ohio. We divorced
                    in 1983. Tom and I remained in close touch as he stayed with the farm.
                    Tragically, he was struck with lung cancer in 1999 and died in 2001. His
                    daughter Tami called me out of the blue one day to tell me the sad news. Tom was
                    buried in his birthplace in Washington, Pennsylvania on September 11, not far
                    from where United Flight 93 was brought down during the Al Qaeda attacks.
                    Looking back, I realize that Tom made it possible for me to join the Foreign
                    Service in 1983. I felt responsible for the horses and land, and was relieved
                    when he wanted to keep the farm. After our separation, I moved to Columbus near
                    Ohio State University. I was finishing my Masters and thinking about ways to
                    reengage internationally. That's when the call came from Eugenia saying the
                    State Department has a vacancy.</p>

                        Sandusky. Did you have a dual life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: More like a mosaic. I always felt at ease among country people, though I'm
                    an urban animal. Moving among different circles of friends and learning
                    languages always came naturally to me. Living abroad was just one more step. In
                    societies like South America, Central Europe and the Middle East, history
                    intrudes into everything. There the typical activist has many sides writer,
                    organizer, professor, healer, entrepreneur, politico. Our ancestors were farmers
                    and weavers, fiddlers and thinkers. They thought nothing of it. To me, diplomacy
                    is the capacity to take multiple perspectives into account and treat them with
                    respect. John Keats called this negative capability. He meant the capacity to
                    hold uncertainties, doubts, and contradictory ideas in mind without “irritably
                    reaching after facts and reason.”</p>
                <p>So yes, I have other dimensions, and with any luck they connect up. I tried my
                    hand at singing in cafes. Now I put that energy into performing and composing on
                    the harp. I practiced organic farming in Ohio. The horse spirit was inside me
                    from birth. My sisters and I felt our real home was in Chenango County, New York
                    at Tarbell Farms. There we had a retired quarter horse racer named Cyclone that
                    no man could ride. He was a real handful, but Eloise, who could be a good mother
                    hen —</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: So we thought. In the summer, though, she let us run wild. We rode on that
                    farm from age three on. And on horses her attitude was if you fall off, you get
                    up and get back on. I was ten when we got Cyclone. He was the same age, behaving
                    like a high-strung stallion. Once he ran away with me down the main road to
                    Tarbell. It terrified me. But I stayed with him that day. Cyclone was my heart's
                    friend growing up.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>At Mother's memorial service, my sister Anne told a story we'd never heard. In
                    1918, when she was nine, Eloise was at Tarbell with her sister Anne, mother
                    Louise and grandfather Gage as the flu epidemic was in full force. Eloise got
                    the flu but recovered quickly. Louise was out helping the families of others who
                    were affected. Gage organized a Christmas party for the farm families. Many
                    children had lost siblings to the illness or the war. It was a gloomy winter.
                    Gage asked Eloise to ride Cherokee, a retired polo horse, up the road to invite
                    the children. She slapped on a saddle blanket. She was too short to mount by
                    herself, so they helped her up and she started down the icy road. Cherokee
                    slipped on the ice and Eloise fell off. She was far from the first farmhouse,
                    not knowing how to get back on. She put her arms around his neck and whispered
                    in his ear, “Cherokee, please help me get back on.” Cherokee lifted his leg and
                    held it there steadily as she put her foot on it and mounted. She rode on to
                    finish the task and everyone enjoyed the party at Tarbell, complete with gifts
                    for every child.</p>
                <p>When I went to Ohio, I already had a horse in the Washington area. I didn't
                    realize I was going to be moved. I had just bought a spirited, badly treated
                    buckskin named Noah who regained his health, and I carted him to Ohio when the
                    AFL-CIO transferred me there. The ranch where I first boarded Noah gave me a
                    second horse, a Saddlebred named Sailor, whose ligaments had been badly damaged
                    in an earlier fall. He recovered fully when he got more attention and space on
                    our farm. Once when I came home in the evening, Noah's eyes beckoned me from the
                    field. I knew immediately from the urgency in his silence that Sailor was in
                    trouble. I jumped on him without saddle or bridle and we galloped to the woods
                    where Sailor was standing, soaked with sweat and fear, his hind leg trapped in
                    hanging vines. Noah saved Sailor's life and showed me the power of animal
                    communication.</p>
                <p>Tom and I raised a few Herefords. His son Todd kept Berkshire hogs on the farm,
                    and we had a big garden of tomatoes and peppers. It was like running a house
                    with 200 bedrooms. You're never done. While I don't intend to farm again, it
                    gave me a passion for taking care of the land. The farm started out as sixteen
                    acres. It was thirty acres when I left. When Tom and I parted ways, he bought
                    the farm on land contract. He kept the horses, and even adopted back two dogs —
                    the offspring of our treasured Malamute, Nemo — that Eugenia Kemble had taken
                    in. I visited the farm after moving to Washington, and we stayed in touch for a
                    good while. It was sad to contemplate, but the divorce made us better friends
                    than we had been before the separation.</p>

                <p>ROE: I was living in Columbus on my own in 1981-82. I had taken the foreign
                    service exam on a lark. The clearance delay gave me time to finish my Masters
                    degree and reflect. The AFL-CIO was a great job. I enjoyed working with the Ohio
                    State AFL-CIO Federation. I felt called to work abroad. But I had my doubts
                    about working for the government. The rise of environmental and transnational
                    movements for democracy, the people who marched for freedom in Eastern Europe
                    and brought colonialism to an end in Africthese were fundamental changes that
                    impacted international relations. I doubted the government could comprehend that
                    change in consciousness. Decades earlier, my CU mentor, Alex Garber, had
                    predicted the Soviet Union would collapse from its own dysfunctions and the
                    power of popular resistance. The AFL-CIO was going all out backing the Polish
                    Solid�rnosh (Solidarity) movement in the '80s. But the U.S. intelligence
                    community acted like they were doomed romantics, just raging at the walls.</p>

                        empire together. It was a terrible system as a practical matter. It didn't
                        work very well. But the establishment idea was that people would essentially
                        lose their willingness to challenge it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>1983 is an interesting time. Did you get the feeling when you were involved in
                    the union movement that something essential changed when the Reagan
                    administration took a stand against the aircraft controllers? I mean I'm not an
                    authority on this, but it seemed that when Reagan broke that union, this began a
                    rather straight-line decline of union power in the United States. Did you feel
                    any of this?</p>
                <p>ROE: Before Reagan, union membership was decreasing largely because of changes in
                    the culture and economy of work. But starting in the 1980s, deregulation of key
                    industries and organized hostility to unions took a bigger toll. President
                    Reagan fundamentally changed the interpretation of national labor laws to
                    disadvantage the unions. This had a huge impact over time. Before, if you won a
                    union election, the company would be required to negotiate in good faith.
                    Post-Reagan, companies could basically break labor laws with impunity, stonewall
                    contract negotiations, and fire union organizers without fear of significant
                    penalty by the National Labor Relations Board. Free market fundamentalism
                    dominated the national agenda. There's the dichotomthe U.S. was promoting
                    workplace democracy abroad especially in challenging the Soviets, but we didn't
                    respect it at home. Now in Ohio, the unions were changing their strategy to
                    survive. There the state AFL-CIO was stronger than the Democratic Party. They
                    were fighting environmental contaminants in the workplace and had become the
                    main engine in getting out the vote. This contrasted with some other states
                    where the union movement was more politically isolated and perhaps less
                    inclusive.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Another major change impacted me as I entered the foreign service in 1983. My
                    mother, who was widowed in 1977, remarried that year. Her best friend from
                    college, “Banny” Showalter, who lived in Indiana, died suddenly of a heart
                    attack in December 1982. Banny's husband Lee had known Eloise and our family for
                    over 50 years. The two of them started visiting, first by phone, then more
                    frequently in person. They got married shortly after I departed for my first
                    overseas assignment and lived a vibrant life together for the next two decades.
                    This eased my mind when I was thousands of miles away. At Eloise's memorial
                    service in 2001, Lee, who had the looks and manners of a Cary Grant, told how he
                    had two wonderful wives, both college roommates, each of whom was “lots smarter
                    than I, but I managed to bluff it through!”</p>

                <p>ROE: It was a big stew. Some foreign service officers or FSOs were pretty green
                    in work experience and busting out with academic credentials. Many were
                    economists. The macro-economic classicism of Milt Friedman and his Chicago Boys
                    were then in vogue. They tended to believe the laws of supply and demand would
                    create their own equilibrium. They looked down on Keynesian economics, on
                    American labor, on Europe's social and economic policies. We often sparred about
                    that. Others came from careers as veterans, architects, teachers, attorneys,
                    Peace Corps officers. The few CIA officers who were part of the training added
                    to the mix of viewpoints and backgrounds. I wasn't the oldest person in the

                <p>ROE: Just shows that the good times start when you learn what's going on! The
                    course reminded me of when I finished my master's in 1980-'81 at Ohio State
                    University. The AFL-CIO wouldn't give me a leave of absence to do it. So I
                    doubled down on work and study. In class, the younger ones would be dozing off
                    or spacing out. I was engaged, because my experiences and associations made all
                    those neurons go off. Likewise, a lot of the A-100 course was fairly
                    stimulating. Although some of the topicprotocol especially - made me think, good
                    grief, what did I get myself into? The best parts were when desk officers came
                    and talked about the range of issues they faced. For example, how do you fight
                    to get attention in the Department and on Capitol Hill for a small country like
                    Ecuador, when Washington wants to ignore everyone but the big powers or the big
                    troublemakers?</p>
                <p>We were sworn in as FSOs in the Ben Franklin room at State. Here we were in this

                    1970s. We hadn't met for a decade. When she learned I'd signed on with State she
                    jibed, “now that's a macho institution if I ever saw one.” Well, the 7th floor
                    ceremony was followed by a reception. Halfway through the mid-career counselor,
                    Margaret Sandler, beckoned me over and whispered, “don't say a word, but there's
                    a rat in the corner. The building has been infested for years!” I looked and
                    sure enough, a big grey fellow was sauntering along the wall as though he
                    belonged there.</p>

                        designed to give people just like yourself with your gender or a different
                        ethnic origin a broader opportunity in the organization. An organism like

                <p>ROE: There were a few sharp elbows. I didn't pay any heed. The paternalism that
                    was present in the labor movement had immunized me. Among union leaders at the
                    time, you could almost read the thought process taking place. It has to do with
                    instant decision-making, intuitive decision making.</p>

                <p>ROE: The blink, yes. When you came into a meeting with someone in, say, the
                    building trades, within a couple of minutes they had made up their minds about
                    whether you were someone who had your own power and knowledge or someone who
                    they imagined had slept their way into that position. Once they decided you were
                    competent, they would treat you with a lot of respect. In the State Department,
                    the power relation was more subtle. A couple of my supervisors in the early
                    years were oppressive, either because they were insecure, or inexperienced
                    managers, or felt uncomfortable with someone from an activist background. I was
                    busy with work, and so clueless about State's personnel process, I could hardly
                    fight back. But most FSOs were fair and helpful. I liked the Latin American
                    region because it tended to attract more adventurous types.</p>

                    handful of really difficult bosses I ever encountered, several were male — and
                    several outstanding bullies were female. In my experience, good management is
                    gender-free, but can't deny certain differences. Men are generally better at
                    self-promotioit's how they're brought up. Women tend to be naturals at
                    networking. Now, there's a huge support system for the junior officers
                    regardless of gender. You're on your own at mid-level. But when I came in, the
                    labor officer network was strong. They ran yearly training programs, had good
                    mentors at headquarters with an institutional memory on what every officer did
                    best. My first job was both a political and labor position, and well chosen.</p>

                <p>ROE: You could find that if you went looking, but under normal conditions the

                    environment.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Bolivia like in '83?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: From 1964 to 1989 you had nineteen presidents; thirteen of them were
                    generals. Bolivia was the one Latin American country where the United States had
                    actually supported a social revolution. One of the guest lecturers in the area
                    studies course was a Cuban-America, Professor Aguilar, who gave a tour
                    d'horizonte of revolutionary movements in Latin America. He confessed that
                    Bolivia impressed him as a country of “lunar sadness, a land of devil masks,”
                    mitigated only by the aloof mysteries of the Indians and the solidity of the
                    Catholic church. (I think this is because he yearned for a warm climate!)
                    Another teacher was Ben Stephansky, who'd been Ambassador to Bolivia in the
                    1952-56 Paz Estenssoro government that carried out the nationalization of the
                    mines and land reform. He termed the Bolivian revolution a “noble experiment”
                    that needs to be followed through. He also suggested throwing away all the books
                    and cultivating an oriental sense of intrigue. After the classes ended and
                    before my departure, I interviewed Stephansky in his home. He gave me some fine
                    contacts, including the Controller General, Antonio “Tony” Sanchez de Lozada and
                    his brother, Gonzalo “Goni” Sanchez de Lozada, who was soon to become Speaker of
                    the Congress and later President. Goni was one of the owners of COMSUR, the
                    largest privately-owned mining operation in the country, with holdings in Peru,
                    Argentina and Brazil.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>Bolivia was unique. President Eisenhower had sent his brother, Milton Eisenhower,
                    to advise Bolivians on the land reforms. The U.S. mounted one of the biggest aid
                    programs in the world after the 1956 revolution. During the administration of
                    Hern�n Siles Zuazo, around a quarter of its income came from U.S. assistance.
                    Bolivia had just emerged from 18 years of military rule and a series of bloody
                    coups. The previous President, General Luis Garc�a Meza, was connected to drug
                    gangs and had ordered massacres in mining country. Siles Zuazo was President in
                    the late 1950s, when he headed the conservative wing of the MNR (Movimiento
                    Nacionalista Revolucionario). His new governing coalition had a large web of
                    parties including the split-off leftist group of young Turks called the MIR
                    (Movimiento Izquierda Revolucionario). Siles Zuazo's initial support base was
                    strong but quickly evaporated as the country faced a staggering economic crisis.
                    By 1984 inflation was running 14,000 percent.</p>

                <p>ROE: Bolivia was facing a foreign exchange crisis. The country carried a three
                    billion dollar debt, which they had just stopped servicing. How to democratize
                    in the midst of extreme scarcity and an economy gone haywire was the dilemma.
                    Hyperinflation caused a major hike in food prices, massive hoarding, and extreme
                    shortages of basic foodstuffs and of gasoline. President Siles Zuazo worked out
                    a series of austerity packages or “paquetes economicos” with the IMF
                    (International Monetary Fund). Siles Zuazo's November '83 belt-tightening
                    program included whopping currency devaluation and more increases in food costs.
                    The discontent triggered was so tremendous that he soon undid the measures,
                    promised more wages to government workers and printed more money. The crisis
                    just kept getting worse while the government's authority unraveled. I was
                    monitoring developments in the trade union movement, the human rights community
                    and several parties on the left including the MIR, trying to figure out how
                    ordinary Bolivians managed to survive.</p>

                    former AID (Agency for International Development) Director. Corr was a hands-on,
                    activist diplomat who knew every region and most major political and social
                    actors in the country. William Walker was the Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM), an
                    astute, hard-boiled, down-to-earth officer.</p>

                <p>ROE: I understand he worked some tough assignments in Central America. He was
                    very creative in Bolivia. Both Corr and Walker encouraged my efforts to break
                    the ice with the COB, the Central Obrera Boliviana. Juan Lech�n was the
                    long-time leader of the COB. He headed the left wing of the MNR in during the
                    1950s. During Paz Estenssoro's second round as President in 1960-'64, he chose
                    Lechin as Vice President with the promise that he would become the MNR's next
                    candidate for President. But Lech�n's political intransigence led to his
                    expulsion from the party in 1964. By the 1980s, Lechin was still charismatic but
                    had lost some of his radical luster. The COB was a flamboyant mixture of
                    Trotskyites, anarchists, a small pro-Moscow Communist wing, many independents
                    and regular down-to-earth trade unionists, particularly among the campesino and
                    transport workers unions. The unifying motto was anti-imperialism. The swear
                    word of the day was “fondomonetarianismo,” which meant anything to do with the
                    IMF. We eventually held a meeting with Ambassador Core, DCM Walker and the COB
                    executive board. The session had plenty of flame-throwing, but we held our
                    own.</p>
                <p>AFL-CIO representative Xavier Vela was assigned to re-open - after a hiatus of
                    twenty years - a Bolivian office for AIFLD (the American Institute for Free
                    Labor Development). I worked closely with Xavier, who later served in Chile with
                    his wife Pilar during my next assignment. Xavier was a Latin American labor
                    history buff and great fun to work with. I worked with several of the more
                    moderate labor leaders. The most respected were Victor Lopez Arias, the head of
                    the mineworkers union, and Noel Vasquez, general secretary of the COB. The
                    situation they faced was grim, almost surreal. Runaway inflation was shredding
                    peoples' livelihoods; teachers and many other public service workers simply
                    weren't being paid. This radicalized many, and drove others into despair.</p>

                    did. I kept a .38 revolver at home. I didn't take a gun to Chile, because it

                <p>During my first year I was involved in the rescue of U.S. hostages at a tin mine
                    in the highlands. We lived at 10,500 feet altitude and worked at 11,900 feet. An
                    Embassy shuttle would pick us up at our residences and take us to the Embassy in
                    downtown (I should say uptown!) La Paz. When I boarded the van one morning, the
                    consul general told me that two U.S. mining technicians had been kidnapped in
                    Chicote Grande, a remote altiplano mine. I volunteered to join the expedition,
                    not knowing it was going to be an overnight trip. We ended up sleeping on a
                    freezing floor at the neighboring mine. Before departing the Embassy, I had
                    called Mineworkers SecGen Victor Lopez. I said we wanted to resolve the
                    situation peacefully and asked for his cooperation. Lopez was very concerned. My
                    hunch is he helped behind the scenes. Just before we reached our destination in
                    the mountains, an open flatbed truck full of vigilantes with shotguns followed
                    us to the mining camp. Our biggest challenge was convincing the local posse not
                    to go in and cause bloodshed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the vigilantes were going to enter the mine.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: Oh yes. They wanted to take the situation into their own hands and shoot up
                    the miners, supposedly to free the U.S. engineers and the company officers being
                    held hostage. The police chief hastily organized this group. It was a nasty
                    overlay to an already sticky situation. About halfway through the night, the
                    mine owner arrived. He spoke with the miners, and told them the Yankees were
                    across the hill; if any harm came to the hostages, the Yankees would come in.
                    His approacthat we have to work this out among us Bolivianeventually worked. By
                    morning the miners released the hostages. Their rebellion had started in
                    response to outside circumstances: a door-to-door weapons search by the local
                    police had so infuriated the women that they instigated a mine takeover to
                    protest the raid. I wrote the reporting cable. We had quite a celebration when
                    the technicians later visited the Embassy.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Ben Stephansky told me about the saga of Joseph Flack, who served in
                    the turbulent period from 1946-49, during the post-war collapse of the tin
                    market. Flack arrived as head of mission just as a popular revolution had
                    unseated President Villarroel — a mob hauled the former dictator from his office
                    and hung him from a lamppost in Plaza Murillo. Later a strike at the Catavi
                    mines led to a standoff in which nine engineers including five Americans were
                    taken hostage. The Mexican wife of one hostage thought she could free her man by
                    browbeating the miners, but they didn't appreciate that. One American was shot
                    through the jaw, one escaped and one was killed. So violence was often a phantom
                    presence in mining country.</p>
                <p>Bolivia's history is full of dark forces and tragic exploitation. But it's a
                    beautiful country with unforgettable people. In the altiplano, the dominant
                    ethnic group is the Aymara. In the 1950s, around 60 percent of Bolivians were
                    monolingual - they spoke Aymara, Quechua, Guarani, Ayoreo or another of the more
                    than 30 native dialects, not Spanish. That changed in the late '60s and '70s to
                    where a slight majority spoke Spanish as well.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: Quite a shock, I imagine. I was called back to Bolivia a year and a half
                    after my tour ended and explored that issue a bit more. Ironically, the COB, by
                    channeling the miners' discontent through the political process, cushioned
                    against the potential for violent revolution a la Che Guevara. The land reform
                    of the 1950s also helped deflate a potentially dangerous social explosion. It
                    dramatically increased the mobility of campesinos who for centuries had been
                    tied to the land and its feudal owners. This in turn contributed to the growth
                    of Santa Cruz, Bolivia's agricultural powerhouse. The other shock absorber was
                    the traditional outlook of the indigenous communities. Their center of focus is
                    the family and their land. In their lives the village walls are high, and
                    government far away.</p>

                <p>ROE: Not in the usual way, but I could identify with the miners' efforts to
                    overcome centuries of social exclusion. U.S. unions are much more structured and
                    way less politicized than those in Bolivia. Negotiating and servicing union
                    contracts takes up much of their energy, mainly because U.S. unions and their
                    allies managed to win legal and social protections we now take for granteat
                    least until recently. Back in the time of robber baron capitalism, we had our
                    Mother Jones, we had Emma Goldman and the “Wobblies” or Industrial Workers of
                    the World who were anarcho-syndicalists.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: Very different. Two of my closer contacts, Gonzalo “Goni” Sanchez de Lozada
                    and Ron McClean were steeped in politics and socially conscious. At the time,
                    Sanchez de Lozada ran the mining company COMSUR. He was elected President in
                    1986. McClean worked for Inti Raimi, managing several open pit mines. The
                    company was exploring more environmentally healthy means of extracting gold.
                    McClean was elected mayor of La Paz several times. He also served as Finance
                    Minister and Minister of Sustainable Development. In a European context, Sanchez
                    de Lozada and McClean would be Christian Democrats or conservatives.</p>

                <p>My love of horses opened some doors. The riding club near my home was in a place
                    like Death Valley. It was a small ring encircled by stables, close to
                    cathedral-like cliffs and gorges where condors flew. There was no central
                    building or fancy infrastructure. The volunteer administrator was Gustavo
                    Medeiros, an architect and well-known painter. During the worst economic crisis
                    he doubled as a taxi driver. The head of the Cervecer�a, the Bolivian brewing
                    company, McClean and his wife, and several other Bolivians formed the core
                    membership. For the groom and space and renting my horse, with the fluctuating
                    inflation rates I paid anything from ten dollars to fifty-five a month. The
                    atmosphere was relaxed, like a small family ranch in the Rockies. The uniform
                    was blue jeans and a sweater or warm jacket. On Saturday afternoon, a group
                    would go riding into the badlands. All of them knew COB leader Juan Lech�n
                    personally. The conversation was witty, wide-ranging, not the usual country club
                    drivel.</p>
                <p>My Aymara housekeeper, Elsa, listened to the radio and followed the political
                    score like a pro. She followed the debates, fist fights and maneuvers that went
                    on in the Bolivian Congress as avidly as if she were watching a game of soccer.
                    She could remember what they said in a debate and all their jokes, which were
                    numerous. The country's parliamentary debates were publicly broadcast long
                    before C-SPAN made those of the U.S. Congress accessible.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: Cochabamba is to the east. It's a lot warmer than La Paz. Then you have
                    Santa Cruz and the Beni, the eastern llanos, a dynamic economy, very free market
                    and independent-minded. The southeastern tropical flatlands feature natural gas
                    and oil, cattle ranching and other large-scale agricultural enterprises. Tarija,
                    to the south, is also rich in resources.</p>

                        corruption? Were there a set of root causes that caused this terrible
                        economic crisis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: Corruption and despotism were the sour legacy of the colonial period. The
                    1952 revolution gave the vote to women and indigenous people. The MNR — the
                    Revolutionary Nationalist Movement party of Paz Estenssoro — forged a social
                    consensus, drawing together members of the middle class with the trade unions
                    and campesinos to make major reforms. They broke down a feudal system, but their
                    land reforms didn't open a way for poor farmers to advance. Peasants got small
                    parcels with little to no access to credit or technical support, and they
                    remained deeply indebted. The pre-revolutionary inequities were reinforced
                    because the government was resource-poor and unable to support changes in
                    agricultural production. Today, according to the UN, 100 families own 62 million
                    acres while 2 million small farmers work 12 million acres.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>The nationalization of the mines soaked up scarce resources as global tin markets
                    were shrinking. With a government bureaucracy mired in patronage and cronyism,
                    there was no room for competitiveness. In the 1960's the IMF and other IFIs
                    (international financial institutions) promoted austerity measures to transform
                    the economy without addressing these deeper problems. The main onus was placed
                    on public workers and the miners, whose hard-won benefits began evaporating.
                    Runaway inflation fell hard on the urban middle class, driving many into the
                    opposition. The MNR coalition fractured under these pressures. Adding to the
                    political conflict, the U.S. was working with the Bolivian armed forces to
                    develop a pilot project to eradicate coca production, a major source of
                    livelihood for impoverished farmers. As a last-ditch survival strategy,
                    displaced miners from the altiplano were becoming coca farmers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved with the campesinos and the collision
                        of various forces?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: I had contacts with the campesino unions. I engaged with organizations that
                    were proposing alternative strategies. I reported on developments in the labor
                    and human rights communities, and followed the MIR party and a cluster of
                    radical groups. I participated in the USAID's Small Projects Development Fund,
                    which sadly no longer exists. The Fund channeled resources to the Altiplano and
                    other indigenous communities. Each project was capped at $10,000, and the
                    community had to match that in funds or sweat equity. They helped build schools,
                    start microenterprises and health clinics. In cooperation with the campesino
                    federation I identified several pilot projects that were approved, and joined
                    AID officers in inaugurating them.</p>
                <p>One time I traveled with AID to Huancarama, a remote altiplano community, to
                    commemorate one of their literacy programs. When we arrived at the site of the
                    celebration, I was surprised to find myself introduced as one of the featured
                    speakers. So I had to think fast. At an altitude of around 14,500 feet, this
                    wasn't a snap. After the main event, the local leaders invited us to visit other
                    villages that had handicraft exhibits. We explained that we had to get back down
                    the mountainside before dark. The campesino blockaded us and refused to let us
                    leave. So we stopped at other villages until eventually we talked our way
                    out.</p>
                <p>The tin mines were failing and the economy was in free fall. The only
                    alternatives the government could offer were for miners to scratch out a living
                    in agriculture or in the tiny, doomed cooperative mines. Those miners are still
                    scavenging inside the largely abandoned silver and tin mines, living in
                    desperate circumstances. Most die before the age of 45 from black lung, mining
                    accidents or hunger. Meanwhile, the political scene was rocked by conspiracies
                    which only a writer of magical realism could imagine. President Zuazo was
                    briefly kidnapped in 1984. A group of leftist paramilitaries rumored to have
                    Interior Ministry passes were arrested for apparent possession of army
                    weapons.</p>

                        concentrating on the altiplano as opposed to the agricultural places down
                        Santa Cruz and elsewhere.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: Yes, in the sense that the most potent unrest emerged from the altiplano.
                    USAID's efforts were countrywide, with a focus on the poorer regions. Santa Cruz
                    and the Beni have been the center of the “other” Bolivia's prosperity. They are
                    practically separate economies. La Paz and the highlands were struggling with
                    severe economic and social crises.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any spillover from Chile under Pinochet and from
                        Argentina, which was trying to bring itself back into the world economic
                        order?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: Chile wasn't considered a model by most Bolivians, although some elements no
                    doubt liked Pinochet's iron fist or “mano duro.” Argentina was no beacon either.
                    I worked closely with the Catholic Church and with NGOs that were helping to
                    grow civil society and advocate respect for human rights. Although Bolivia had a
                    free press, the country still had a repressive police system and rampant
                    inequalities. I learned the power of the telephone: sometimes calling a jail to
                    inquire about a prisoner's fate would convince his or her tormentors that people
                    on the outside were watching and prepared to act. I also cooperated with the
                    Federation of Private Sector Employers, CEPD. They organized their own general
                    strikes to protest violent union takeovers and the breakdown of law and order.
                    Few were fans of Pinochet, but they liked the economic reforms his government
                    initiated.</p>

                <p>ROE: The monetarists didn't find a lot of fertile ground in La Paz. Bolivian
                    entrepreneurs were a pragmatic lot. They tended to be skeptical of big ideas
                    from big countries. Most CEPD leaders wanted market forces to be free to work
                    their wonders, but they realized the need for social safety nets to create a
                    more educated work force. Politically, they were closer to the Spanish
                    conservatives and some of the German Christian Democrats.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: Oh, there was a very strong anti-American current. Still the intelligentsia
                    and some on the left remembered that the U.S. under President Eisenhower
                    supported the social revolution in the 1950s. Bolivians across the board
                    identified with President Kennedy and the Alliance for Progress.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: To spur economic development and spreading democracy in the region. It was a
                    helping hand extended to our neighbors. President Kennedy said our destinies are
                    linked to those of the poorest regions of the world. He acted on those words.
                    The Alliance was flawed in its reliance on government-to-government aid. But it
                    kindled a spark of hope that lasted long after Bolivia's reform movement peaked.
                    In 1984, during a visit to Siglo XX, the largest tin mine and a hotbed of social
                    rebellion, I learned that the local high school was named after Franklin Delano
                    Roosevelt. We set up a project through USIS (United States Information Service)
                    to bring a group of miners' children from Siglo XX and Catavi to the U.S. They
                    were selected through a competitive essay. The students stayed with U.S. mining
                    families for three months in Colorado, Utah and West Virginia. After the tour,
                    one student commented that “Americans have a lot, but they work really hard for
                    the things they have.”</p>
                <p>Bolivians appreciated U.S. efforts to keep their fledgling democratic government
                    from toppling. Ambassador Corr actively discouraged several incipient military
                    coups against President Siles Zuazo. During the general strike of 1984, the COB
                    staged a seventeen-day blockade of La Paz. No one could get in or out of the
                    city. I was taking the pulse on the streets, talking with the operations center
                    and sending daily situation reports. Corr and Walker helped to cool tempers on
                    both sides.</p>
                <p>Of course, the dogmatic left loved to hate the U.S. What brought out the
                    strongest nationalism and paranoia were the coca wars. One of my more awkward
                    assignments was to survey attitudes in the Chapare towards U.S. assistance
                    efforts on the eve of a major campaign to try and halt drug-related coca
                    production. I interviewed a local radio announcer, priests, campesinos. None
                    were sanguine about the prospects for the anti-drug intervention, but they
                    seemed glad to have someone hear them out. The high point of my trip was riding
                    a water buffalo at a local farm. But the subject of my interviews terrified the
                    USAID rep who escorted me around the region. He said, “I don't know you. I don't
                    know what you're doing. Let's just say I'm your driver.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: Chapare is a semitropical province north of Cochabamba that was a prime
                    target for coca eradication. It has around 35,000 inhabitants, nearly all
                    farmers.</p>

                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>ROE: Yes; coca is a traditional crop. Miners and other highlanders have used it
                    for centuries for religious purposes and health reasons. The plant helps them
                    withstand harsh, cold conditions and to resist hunger. It's a natural stimulus
                    that also alleviates stomach problems. It's an excellent tea. When I went down
                    into the Siglo XX mine, it was one of the first times a woman had been allowed
                    to enter the mine shafts. I saw effigies to the gods of the underworld. People
                    leave offerings of coca to ask for the deities' protection against cave-ins.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: It's a danger wherever big drug money accumulates. But Bolivia was a raw
                    materials venue, not a cocaine supplier like Colombia or Mexico. There were no
                    factories to convert coca into cocaine. The eastern part of Bolivia in the Beni
                    and other flatlands is studded with runways for the illicit export of coca.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: My close friends included Canadians and Australians, and we'd team up in
                    putting on larger parties for our Bolivian contacts. I had a modestly sized
                    apartment with a small patio in Calacoto, where foreigners and many professional
                    Bolivians lived. The embassy functions were lively, not the boring Fourth of
                    July type functions. When Ambassador Corr had people over to talk about
                    politics, he often included me because so much impinged on what the labor
                    movement was doing, the political parties I followed or human rights concerns.
                    Bill Lofstrom, the political counselor, and his wife Ana Maria lived just a few
                    houses down from me. Intellectuals and journalists and other public figures
                    frequented their salon and enjoyed their gracious hospitality.</p>
                <p>During my first year I started dating a race car driver, Oscar Crespo, a Bolivian
                    version of Paul Newman. He was born in Sucre, grew up in abject poverty and made
                    himself wealthy running a car sales and rental business in La Paz. We traveled
                    to the countryside when I had time off.</p>
                <p>You asked about this being a new life for me. I recall a Cuban-American professor
                    in one of my FSI classes warning, “Beware of the altitude and the
                    lonelinesBolivia is remote, like the wrong side of the moon.” Others called it
                    the Tibet of the Americas. Yet my first arrival there struck me like a
                    home-coming.</p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>I flew to La Paz from Panama City in a small jetliner, arriving at dawn. The
                    plane approached over a huge plateau with humongous peaks on either side. This
                    was the altiplano, opening into a long valley where La Paz seemed sunken in a
                    long curving bowl. We curled around, flying back to the edge. I prayed the pilot
                    was alert. The plane landed lightly as a feather on a narrow runway, 14,000 feet
                    above sea level. The airport looked like a small country store. A few embassy
                    souls met me, some grousing about the desolate social life, the health problems.
                    I was oblivious. My whole being absorbed the vivid colors, the Indian faces,
                    their graceful movements and stoical expressions, the indigenous artwork filling
                    the front of the airport. The view was stunning.</p>
                <p>I felt exhilarated to be there. The best advice I received was to take aspirin
                    every four hours, even if you feel great. With that remedy, I never had altitude
                    sickness. Within two days, Ambassador Corr said, “Hey, we're going to Guaqui,
                    come along.” Guaqui is the port town on Lake Titicaca, 13,000 feet high in the
                    mountains. It's the narrow part of the lake across from Peru. The town houses a
                    steam car workshop. We were invited by the railroad workers' federation and the
                    national railroad company, ENFE. We traveled by rail in the eight-person coach
                    called a ferrobus. I didn't realize that I was coming down with gastroenteritis.
                    The night before I had savored the Bolivian beewhich is delicious, dark, like
                    German beeand had eaten spicy foods: both not advised in the first week. As we
                    rode switchback up the mountain in the little eight-person coach called a
                    ferrobus, my stomach felt like a deep sea diver's getting decompression
                    cramps.</p>

                <p>ROE: It felt like two saws were working inside of me. Our hosts offered more
                    typical, spiced-up Bolivian food. I ate some out of courtesy. I kept feeling
                    worse and worse. But the voyage was unforgettable. Two snowcapped Andean
                    mountain ranges encircled us. We traversed a corral of clay, rust-colored
                    foothills. Adobe villages arose like garrisons in a wild West movie. Farmers
                    tended flocks of sheep, llamas, burros, tilling fields with ancient wooden
                    plows, the men with brightly woven wool helmets, the women garbed with bustling
                    layers of skirts, brilliant mantas and bowler hats. Lines of schoolchildren,
                    railroad and dock workers greeted us. We visited Isla Saint Rosa on two customs
                    patrol launches, passing fishermen in tiny sailboats. Returning to Guaqui, we
                    entered the massive red-stoned colonial Iglesia del Apostal Santiago. Inside the
                    church, shimmering gold panels, saints sculpted in the mestizo Baroque style.
                    Outside, bleak poverty. Two worlds, one town.</p>
                <p>When I returned to the Embassy I visited Kuni, the nurse. She gave me a pill to
                    calm my stomach and took a blood sample. At 8:00 that evening, someone knocked
                    on my door. Kuni was alarmed about my white blood cell count and sent a Bolivian
                    doctor to treat my gastroenteritis. It was a welcome surprise.</p>

                    a real gentleman. The FSN (foreign service national) staff of the economic

                    people were well known and those who cut corners or were ruthless or corrupt

                    huge demand for guano in Europe. Bolivia's colonial era rulers used the

                <p>ROE: The Catholic Church was a mixed bag. In the provinces, the religious
                    hierarchy was often tied to the same local establishment that had kept the
                    campesinos in their place for centuries. In La Paz, the archbishop's social
                    policy and human rights council leaders were highly committed Jesuits. The
                    director, Father Jose Gramunt, a Spanish Catalan, wrote a newsletter on human
                    rights and social developments in Bolivia. It was one of the most objective
                    chronicles of the times you could find. Father Gramunt was also a regular
                    contributor to the La Paz Catholic daily Presencia. Gramunt and his Jesuit
                    colleagues were looking dispassionately at these catastrophic conditions. They
                    weren't judgmental. They were advocating a more humane, pragmatic approach to
                    problems. I remember the feeling of tranquility that came from talking with
                    them, visiting their office. They were looking at the whole pattern.</p>

                <p>ROE: I kept my private life separate from my professional life. We traveled to
                    the Yungas and to other remote parts of Bolivia. Oscar's daughter, Roxanna
                    Crespo, was just beginning her career as an artist while raising two young
                    children. On the eve of my departure for Chile, she planned her first
                    exposition. Oscar asked if I could help. I had no experience in doing that, but
                    he mainly wanted moral support. I invited friends from different embassies, my
                    riding group and other Bolivian contacts. It was standing room only. Roxanna
                    sold every painting, and became one of the country's more successful artists.
                    Oscar and I kept dating when I began my assignment in Chile. He had been wary of
                    making a commitment, and I had no interest in getting married again. When I
                    moved to Chile, he became Othello-like. That ended our relationship. But the
                    family remained. I'm still friends with Roxanna and very close to her mother,
                    Nora Van Bories, who lives in Santiago to look after Gogo, their handicapped
                    son, a charmer. Nora was an attorney who had advised the ILO (International
                    Labor Organization) experts who came to help revise Bolivia's labor laws in the
                    50's and '60's. Through Nora I met the former President, Lidia Geuiler, and
                    recently reconnected with Tony Sanchez de Lozada and his family in Santiago.</p>

                <p>ROE: In July 1985, I took an assignment as political officer in Chile. When my
                    human rights contacts heard I was considering Santiago, they said, “Oh you don't
                    want to do that. It's very dark there.” I said, “There must be some rays of
                    light or else people couldn't cope.” Ambassador Corr asked me to go to El
                    Salvador with him. I couldn't see myself in a place where I'd be restricted in
                    my movements and where the U.S. presence was so disproportionate. Fortunately
                    Corr understood. He helped me land the political officer position in Santiago.
                    As I got ready to depart post, the USAID director asked me to adopt a beautiful
                    blue and gold macaw bird that he had raised with his hunting dog. He had been
                    assigned to Indonesia and found that he couldn't bring the macaw with him. So I
                    acquired a large parrot, whom I called Rosita the Loqui. Getting her a passport
                    to enter Chile was a complicated transaction.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: It was gloomy, conflicted. Though Bolivia was also in turmoil, by comparison
                    this felt like stepping into a cauldron. Augusto Pinochet had been in power
                    since the coup he led as army commander on September 11, 1973. President
                    Salvador Allende committed suicide that day in La Moneda palace. Pinochet ruled
                    with an iron fist. He outlawed the political parties. Tens of thousands were
                    tortured, disappeared, killed or exiled during his campaign against the
                    pro-Allende communists and socialists. The military government planned to
                    implement a provision of the 1976 constitution to recognize certain political
                    parties in a formal process, but few Chileans believed this would take place or
                    lead to positive change. The 1980 constitution imposed by Pinochet further
                    concentrated his powers. It promised an eventual return to electoral
                    “democracy,” beginning with a plebiscite in 1988 in which voters could say “yes”
                    or “no” to the junta's sole candidate.</p>
                <p>The opposition to Pinochet made itself felt through massive street
                    demonstrations. Some mainstream political parties joined in, but those in charge
                    were mostly the trade union vanguard, students and the radical left. The police
                    would douse the protesters with water canons, spray tear gas, and start shooting
                    with little provocation. The middle class was unhappy about the repression but
                    also weary of these futile confrontations. Chileans felt frustrated and
                    depressed. Beggars held out their hands at every street corner. The crisis over
                    foreign exchange triggered a sharp recession.</p>

                        Kirkpatrick as our Ambassador to the UN also sat in on the cabinet and was
                        stating that we should work closely with the military leaders in Latin
                        America, because they were closer to our ideals and all. How stood our
                        policy towards Chile when you went there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: Kirkpatrick's 1979 article in Commentary magazine argued that the U.S.
                    should work with authoritarian governments like those of Chile, Argentina and
                    South Africa because they were more likely to lead to democracy than were
                    revolutionary regimes of the left. This was debatable, but it tagged her as
                    pro-dictator. She also fervently criticized President Carter's human rights
                    policies. Outgoing Ambassador James Theberge was in the Kirkpatrick mode. He
                    maintained a pretty friendly relationship with the military government. Theberge
                    kept his distance from the leading opposition figure, Gabriel Valdez, the
                    President of the Christian Democratic Party (PDC). In the early 1980s the U.S.
                    frequently bashed the PDC and other center left opposition parties for not
                    banning the communists from taking part in the protest demonstrations. But the
                    U.S. Congress kept a close eye on human rights violations, and the Embassy
                    raised its voice on those issues. The human rights officer...</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: Don Knight, who also arrived in the summer of '85, was the labor and human
                    rights officer. He covered all the demonstrations, worked closely with
                    Solidaridad, the Catholic human rights agency, and visited imprisoned trade
                    union leaders. When I arrived, John Keane was political counselor. George Jones
                    soon became the Deputy Chief of Mission (DCM). Connie Poli was office manager, a
                    quiet, steadfast spirit in the political section. The political officer whom I
                    replaced had formed relationships with most democratic political parties except
                    the socialists. This changed after Ambassador Harry Barnes's arrival.</p>
                <p>The front office tapped me to draft Barnes' credentials speech. I was stumped at
                    first — how do you say to Pinochet that we're here to undermine you and assist
                    the rebirth of democracy? So I brainstormed with Jorge Castillo, the senior FSN
                    and a stalwart in the political section. The message we crafted was: “We have
                    deep, long-standing ties and common interests with Chile and its people. We
                    support the goal of a transition to democracy. We'll be watching closely to see
                    how this process evolves...”</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>During Ambassador Barnes' first few weeks, he went to visit Gabriel Valdez in his
                    office. His gesture sent shockwaves throughout the Pinochet government. The
                    pro-Pinochet hawks disseminated a rumor that when Barnes left Chile, it would be
                    in a six-foot box. (Actually they would have needed a six-foot-five box because
                    the Ambassador is a tall man.) The new U.S. approach emboldened the opposition.
                    Even the pro-democracy conservatives began finding their voices. The Europeans
                    had been supporting the opposition financially, in a patchwork approach. Barnes
                    met daily with key civic, political and intellectual leaders one on one at his
                    residence. I often sat in on these. Barnes had a photographic memory. When he
                    went to meet with Pinochet or the members of his junta, he would report every
                    word that was said. A huge audience in Washington followed these
                    conversations.</p>

                        going to be more supportive of the opposition?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: His actions spoke that message. The Embassy no longer echoed the right's
                    criticism of the opposition. That's why the first Barnes-Valdez meeting was such
                    a profound shift. We opened up close channels with the democratic socialist wing
                    of the opposition, which the U.S. had previously tended to equate with the
                    Allende left.</p>
                <p>The outgoing cultural attach�, Peter DeShazo, opened his house to democratic
                    socialists as well as to Christian Democrats and other opposition leaders, but
                    Ambassador Theberge strongly discouraged these ties. I made contact with a
                    myriad of political groups. These included socialists, the Radical party, and
                    the Humanists, a left-of-center international organization founded in Argentina
                    that advocates non-violence and the development of human potential; the National
                    party, an older conservative grouping; and Renovaci�n Nacional, a new moderate
                    conservative party with an engaging leader, Andres Allemand, a former national
                    soccer hero of Chile.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: All were engaged to some degree. Chilean exiles had fostered these ties. The
                    Europeans sponsored many Chilean socialist, Christian democratic and democratic
                    left leaders. They supported their think tanks, some of which like FLACSO (the
                    Latin American Faculty of Social Sciences) were mini- governments in exile. In
                    the mid-80s Ricardo Lagos formed a democratic socialist party called the PPD,
                    Partido por la Promoci�n de la Democr�cia. The PPD was a friendly competitor
                    with the Socialist Party, which had both an Allende wing and a larger democratic

                <p>Together with the new PAO (USIS director) Marilyn McAfee, I sought out and
                    sponsored many emerging Chilean leaders to go to the U.S. so they could better
                    understand the U.S. policy environment. We wanted to balance the strong European
                    orientation among the opposition. The intellectual climate shifted as they saw
                    how serious we were about supporting the democracy movement, without trying to
                    impose any terms of our own.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your piece of the action as a political
                        officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: I was liaison with the political parties. I reported on political
                    developments from the provinces. I worked with the National Electoral Commission
                    (CNE). The Commission was directed by Juan Ignacio Garcia, whose brother was
                    Interior Minister. Juan Ignacio, an experienced civil servant, had been in the
                    government from the time of Frei and Allende.</p>
                <p>As we approached the plebiscite, the U.S. provided 1.5 million dollars in
                    assistance to ensure that the plebiscite would have a level playing field.
                    C�vitas, one of the main civil society organizations, ran a nationwide campaign
                    to re-register all the Chileans who wanted to vote. Pinochet had destroyed all
                    the registration rolls and established a national identification system. To
                    register, people had to pay the equivalent of nearly 5 dollars to get an ID card
                    and then get on the electoral rolls. It was an onerous process. Under the
                    leadership of Monica Jimenez, the head of Catholic University's School of Social
                    Work, C�vitas mounted a non-partisan voter education campaign to convince people
                    their vote would be counted and to assist them in registering. The Pinochet
                    regime undercut their efforts to get public service announcements and paid
                    television advertising. I helped convince Juan Ignacio Garcia that C�vitas and
                    Monica Jimenez did not have a political agenda and were legitimate actors.</p>
                <p>As the 1988 plebiscite loomed, Washington was hungry to find out if there really
                    was any chance for a fraud-free election. I briefed the news reporters on that
                    issue. I analyzed the implementation of political laws under the 1976
                    constitution, the emerging civil society organizations and political party
                    dynamics. I helped promote emerging women leaders through IVs and lunch sessions
                    hosted by PAO Marilyn McAfee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like we were meddling like hell in Pinochet's
                        country.</hi>

                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>ROE: We were engaged, but more subtly than during the Allende period. And that
                    experience left a big debt to pay. U.S. assistance to the opposition was
                    non-partisan, because there were no candidates in the plebiscite, just a vote to
                    say “si” or “no” to the regime. As for C�vitas, somebody had to go out and help
                    register people. Ambassador Barnes kept the lines of communication open to both
                    sides, playing such a deft game that Pinochet had to think twice before openly
                    attacking the U.S. Pinochet's military junta was a quasi-cabinet that also
                    doubled as his legislative counsel. Two of the four junta members were asserting
                    their independence from PinocheAir Force Commander Matthei and Carabineros
                    Commander Stange. They resisted Pinochet's moves to undermine his own
                    constitution. That was a key opening.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile Pinochet's government was making political parties into legitimate
                    actors, while demonizing them in its propaganda. The PDC, PPD, the radicals,
                    conservatives and eventually the Partido Socialista won recognition. Within a
                    year of the plebiscite, key opposition forces moved from raw confrontation
                    politics to a willingness to work through the political process. Pinochet hated
                    and mistrusted us, but some elements in his government were moderating their
                    stance, either to make a more presentable case to the world, or because they
                    understood the imperative for change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Letelier case while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: It was a constant concern. The '76 car bombing in Washington that killed
                    foreign minister Orlando Letelier and his U.S. aide Ronni Moffitt transformed
                    U.S. relations with Pinochet. It triggered a cutoff of military aid and a
                    decades-long investigation of the role of top officials including Pinochet
                    himself in the assassination. At one point Juan Gabriel Valdez, who later became
                    Chilean ambassador to the UN, offered to provide sensitive information on the
                    case and I connected him with Ambassador Barnes. The Congress and the NGO
                    community kept up pressure in the effort to develop credible information for the
                    Justice Department. The case stayed red hot. In the end it was a major element
                    in Pinochet's downfall. And speaking of interference in another country: sending
                    hit men to assassinate a foreign minister in the U.S. capitol was about the
                    limit </p>
                <p>

                        Meaning, they were getting ready for their own sort of People's Republic.
                        This was not an overthrowing of the savior or something. Did you get a feel
                        for the Allende types and where they were coming from?</hi>

                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>ROE: Allende inspired great passions pro and con. I didn't have direct contact
                    with the communists, but I knew some Allende supporters. Many were romantic
                    socialists, some neophytes, others real Marxist zealots. In the early 1970s, the
                    collapsing social and economic system and the political fanaticism of Allende's
                    supporters drove many progressives, including Christian Democrats, to feel that
                    Pinochet would be a lesser evil. The CIA's machinations were idiotic and
                    damaging, but they didn't create the wave of revulsion toward the regime.
                    Allende didn't understand the nature of the Soviet system or the way the economy
                    worked. He set in motion some dangerous forces that caused real hardship and
                    desperation among the population. The radical takeovers of factories and farms
                    and the government's nationalization policies led to a precipitous loss of
                    agricultural and industrial production. There were long food lines and acute
                    shortages. The majority of Chileans were fed up.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: The climate was more circus-like and less violent in Chile, but still it was
                    over the top. The chaos helped precipitate an army coup. Unfortunately, nobody
                    expected that Pinochet would then seize dictatorial powers.</p>
                <p>Speaking about my contact with the Allende people — something happened early in
                    my tour that gave me a curious perspective. In December '85 we learned though
                    back channels that one of the Embassy officers had been targeted for kidnapping
                    by local terrorists. Immediately they thought it must be a male officer. Well,
                    who would be important enough to kidnap? Must be a man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But of course.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: First the station chief, the political counselor and then the labor officer
                    were put under heavy guard. The profile was someone who had a lot of political
                    contacts throughout Chile. By that time I took my postponed annual leave, we
                    learned that it was a female officer. So they put extra security on an intel
                    officer in Santiago — I was in the U.S. and had just left upstate New York for a
                    week in Puerto Rico. Then headquarters called me while I was vacationing in San
                    Juan saying I'd been curtailed because I was the terrorist target! A two-month
                    tug of war ensued.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>Ambassador Barnes opposed the curtailment decision. We knew that the terrorists
                    had dropped their plan, as they didn't have safe houses or other infrastructure
                    to make it work. But I was unable to return until ARA (Inter-American Affairs)
                    and DS (the Diplomatic Security bureau) fought it out. Finally DS asked me what
                    I thought. I said heck, yes, I want to go back. I had a dog, a parrot, a house
                    in Chile. I had no winter clothes, since I had sent them back to Chile after my
                    home visit. Washington in winter was cold, unyielding. I had no checkbook and
                    this was before the age of bank cards. DS said, “Well, you haven't read the
                    information carefully though. They knew all about you.” I said, “This says that
                    Joe Fozo followed me a few days and they decided they couldn't hold me safely.”
                    The security people were trying without success to put the fear in me. The
                    Department eventually had a shoot-out. Michael Armacost, Under Secretary of
                    State for Political Affairs, made the final call that I return.</p>
                <p>In the meantime I volunteered on the Haiti taskforce that was set up as
                    Duvalier's government collapsed. I took the language exam and got a 4/4 in
                    Spanish. I asked for training in counterterrorism techniques. The course was in
                    Florida. After it ended, I was about to board my flight and return to Chile when
                    I got a call from Assistant Secretary Bob Gelbard. He said “You can't go yet.” I
                    replied, “What do you mean? The desk told me it was a done decision.” He said,
                    “Well, don't go, we're still in negotiations.” I had heard that Bolivia urgently
                    needed help because the labor attach� was on extended sick leave. I said, “You
                    need to get me to La Paz or somewhere where I can work, or I'm going to go to
                    Chile and get my checkbook and look after my dog on my own ticket.” He was not
                    used to being talked to that way, but the next day I got my orders to go to
                    Bolivia. After two more months the Department allowed me to return to Santiago,
                    but I had to remain under constant guard for five months.</p>
                <p>During that time, on two separate occasions distant Socialist Party contacts
                    approached me. With a great air of secrecy and concern, each said, “Charlotte,
                    we have very troubling information. Did you know you've been targeted?” I said,
                    “Possibly, but that was then.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, who was targeting you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: It was a small underground group called the MIR, the Movimiento de Izquierda
                    Revolucionario. They had hatched the idea when El Salvador President Duarte's
                    daughter was kidnapped in September '85 to force the release of political
                    prisoners there. The MIR hoped to use me to get their political prisoners sprung
                    in Chile. You can imagine what Pinochet would have said: good riddance!</p>

                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>ROE: That was the O. Henry story where two fugitives kidnapped a boy and held him
                    for ransom, but the bad guys couldn't get anyone to take the little
                    troublemaker. In my case, the would-be kidnappers realized it was a no-go
                    because they lacked resources for stage two. One of the Chileans who got wind of
                    this was an attorney for several jailed MIR dissidents. I told him “don't worry”
                    but sometimes I wasn't so sure, because I couldn't travel anywhere without two
                    armed escorts. To go to the theatre, I needed a limousine and a follow car. I
                    thought, what a brilliant way to make me a bigger target! Because of the threat,
                    the Embassy moved me from my house to a garden apartment. To be able to cover
                    both sides of the flat, the guards had to camp out in the middle. I literally
                    had no privacy. That summer, I finally convinced George Jones, the DCM, to call
                    off the guards. The whole episode was pretty stressful. But it showed me that
                    Chileans will look out for you if they sense you're fair and open.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: Ambassador Barnes occasionally met with Pinochet. The readouts were fairly
                    cryptic. Pinochet was not a big talker. Pinochet reportedly had a close
                    relationship with Senator Jesse Helms, but that's another story. The more useful
                    contacts were with members of the junta. Barnes met regularly with Generals
                    Stange and Matthei, much less so with the Army Commander or with Navy Commander
                    Merino, who was the most pro-Pinochet in the junta and famous for his ludicrous
                    pronouncements. One of my contacts, Jose Antonio Cousino, worked in the Interior
                    Ministry and taught political science at the University of Chile. He provided
                    some valuable insights on the Letelier case and on changing attitudes within the
                    administration, and would later become Director of Planning for the Foreign
                    Ministry under President Lagos.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Within Chilean society did you find it rather sharply
                        divided between supporters of Pinochet and non-supporters or how were you
                        received by these various groups?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: Chilean society was fractured under Allende and even more so under most of
                    Pinochet's reign. The political paranoia fostered by his regime was meant to
                    keep people divided. Embassy functions, both ours and the Europeans, were among
                    the only places the government moderates, the conservative nationals and the
                    democratic left could meet and converse freely.</p>

                        of the Parisians.</hi>

                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>ROE: That came into play. Mostly, they felt betrayed. Chileans see their country
                    as a place of “covivencia” which roughly translates as “living together
                    harmoniously.” The Chilean sense of order and social justice is a legend that
                    began with Pedro de Vald�via. Chileans are proud of their country as a middle
                    class haven, a country that escaped the worst colonial oppression of the lands
                    that supplied Spain's gold and silver. They're also acutely aware of their
                    economic interdependence. Both the opposition and the shadow reform elements in
                    the government wanted to build bridges not only with Europe but also with
                    Southeast Asia. They knew that Pinochet's repression damaged Chile's image, and
                    that the boycotts hurt economically.</p>
                <p>The old elite were stuffy and overbearing. I remember attending a dinner party
                    that was top heavy with this group. One patrician learned that I'd served
                    previously in La Paz and asked me, “Well, how was Bolivia?” expecting that I was
                    going to say, they live in caves, they eat off of the street. Instead I said,
                    “It was a fascinating place. They've been through some real turmoil, but they
                    have a lively free press. The national debates in the Congress are completely
                    free, open — they're nationally televised and attract a huge audience.” When I
                    mentioned the vibrant civic life, a few guests looked about ready to have heart
                    attacks on the spot. The last thing they expected was to hear the view that
                    Bolivia was more advanced in civic discourse.</p>

                    quite a few of Pinochet's top advisors. Generally, the Chicago Boys (CB) recipe
                    for privatizing and removing trade barriers and balancing the macroeconomic
                    variables was judged to be a success. Of course the pundits admitted that you
                    can only implement severe fiscal austerity if you have an iron fist. You can
                    impose them without worrying about the democratic political process. But there
                    are big costs. Not having rule of law means you won't have transparent
                    governance or marketplace; you won't build investor confidence or have economic
                    sustainability. The CB economists erred, for example, in pegging the peso to the
                    dollar. Most observers faulted the government for making the two recessions much
                    deeper than necessary and this may have cost Pinochet a lot of political
                    support.</p>

                <p>You had asked about public reactions to those trying to push U.S. ideas on
                    another country. Well, Chileans didn't want the CB model imposed by an academic
                    institution in the U.S. or anyone else. They adopted those reforms on their
                    terms. When Chileans elected Patricio Aylwin president in 1989, his government
                    and successive administrations kept in place the bulk of the economic reforms.
                    They married the Chicago monetarists to a Chilean version of the New Deal.
                    During the fourteen years of democratic government following Pinochet, Chile's
                    economy maintained fiscal stability while strengthening its social net. They've
                    been the tiger of Latin America. They still have a long ways to go to cut
                    bureaucracy, but post-Pinochet Chile reduced poverty by thirty percent in a
                    decade, which few countries can boast.</p>

                <p>ROE: Pablo Neruda came back from exile. He died of cancer, shortly after the 1993
                    takeover by Pinochet. Neruda passed away just as Pinochet sent his henchmen to
                    take over his residence in Isla Negra.</p>

                    Chile in '78. Ricardo N��ez, the head of the Partido Socialista, was exiled and
                    also returned. Many literary figures came back. Manuel Bustos, the fiery head of
                    the Chilean labor federation, returned from exile in Australia.</p>

                <p>ROE: I'm not sure about all the motivations, but it most likely aimed to get some

                <p>ROE: Chileans are always concerned about Peru. They never lost a transnational
                    war, but they are constantly vigilant about their frontiers. In the late '70s
                    Chile almost came to blows with Argentina. The Pope John Paul intervened in a
                    dramatic moment in 1978.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: That was the issue. Chile and Argentina finally accepted the Vatican's
                    mediation, and in '84 they signed a peace treaty resolving the Beagle dispute.
                    During the Falklands war, Argentina suspected that Chile favored the Brits, and
                    apparently they had quietly supported the British task force in the Southern
                    Atlantic.</p>
                <p>Our main focus was to ensure that Chileans had a chance to have their votes count
                    in the plebiscite and the capacity to make the transition to democracy. Pinochet
                    had committed to an open plebiscite, but few believed his words. We thought the
                    procedural instruments the government had put in place could create the
                    framework for a free and fair election, if the military regime didn't abort the
                    process. Chile is a legalistic, constitutional country that prides itself on
                    respecting the law. The opposition gained strength when it abandoned the
                    strategy of social mobilization in favor of an electoral strategy. Another
                    turning point came when Ricardo Lagos challenged Pinochet directly. In 1984, a
                    year before the plebiscite, he gave a speech in Antofagasta, a bleak, troubled
                    industrial port about halfway between Iquique and Valparaiso that used to be a
                    mining center.</p>
                <p>This was one of Lagos' first rallies as president of PPD, the center-left party
                    he founded in 1987. He was faced with a disruptive group of Communists. The
                    Communist party believed that only armed conflict could end the dictatorship.
                    Few in the opposition knew how to best them. Lagos talked back without
                    hesitation and subdued the hecklers. He also held up his finger to Pinochet and
                    said basically, “J'acuse, I accuse you, Pinochet, of years of torture, murder
                    and violence; I accuse you of not telling the truth.” Nobody had dared to stand
                    up to Pinochet as an equal. The effect was electrifying.</p>
                <p>After that encounter, the parties supporting participation in the plebiscite
                    began recruiting en masse. The C�vitas campaign gained ground. The plebiscite
                    was in October of '88. Three months before the vote, Pinochet's own Supreme
                    Court overturned the junta-approved election regulations saying, “This doesn't
                    meet the fairness test. Your own constitution mandates better rules.” Pinochet
                    would allow opposition voices to have television time, but only for a few
                    minutes at midnight. The courts mandated fair, equal time and changed the rules
                    of the game. That decision built confidence. The opposition had coalesced into
                    what was called the Coordinadora, eighteen political parties under one tent
                    running a single “no” campaign for the plebiscite. The conservative parties
                    remained apart, but some also supported the no vote. The Coordinadora's TV ads
                    were brilliant. They were like political cabaret, with great music and
                    light-hearted lyrics. They rocked people with an upbeat message.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>Lagos, who was elected President of Chile in 2000, visited the U.S in the
                    pre-plebiscite period. He asked me to arrange a key part of the trip. We set up
                    a voluntary visitor program through USIS to facilitate his goal of meeting with
                    Wall Street people. Lagos wanted to let them know that when the “no” vote
                    prevailed, it wasn't going to hurt the economy, that the opposition leadership
                    was committed to keep the basic economic framework in place and work to humanize
                    it. That was a very effective message. A transformation was underway. Our
                    policies and actions had deep resonance, but they were not the main story. The
                    evolving national consensus and the eventual plebiscite victory grew out of
                    tremendous suffering that Chileans had experienced. They found a way to come
                    together and recover their democratic ethos.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: Oh, Pinochet was very confident. Losing the plebiscite completely stunned
                    him. The polls were pretty imprecise. People would tell different things to the
                    pollsters based on whether or not they trusted them or thought the balloting
                    would be fair. So it was a confidence game. But we saw hopeful signs with the
                    banding together of the democratic opposition, the soul searching that led to
                    them presenting a more credible alternative, a team that could Chile to the rule
                    of law and manage the economic transition. Pinochet was trying to say, “after me
                    chaos” in the style of Louis XIV, “Apr�s moi, le deluge.” That was his constant
                    theme, but it was falling flat because the country was deeply divided under him.
                    It was becoming ungovernable.</p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>As hope rekindled, the opposition lightened up, making fun of Pinochet as a
                    doddering old man. Talking with people in the provinces, I saw a tremendous
                    groundswell of support for the “no” side. We thought the opposition could win as
                    long as elections proceeded as planned. But I got wind of something that would
                    have completely thrown the election. One of my close contacts was Jorge Jimenez,
                    the brother of Monica Jimenez, who ran C�vitas. Jorge, a medical doctor, was the
                    opposition liaison with the military. Five days before the plebiscite, Monica
                    called me in Valparaiso where I was doing a pre-election assessment. She said
                    Jorge had solid information that Pinochet intended to stage a mini-coup the
                    night of the election. The plan was to provoke violence and claim it came from
                    the left. They would bring out the soldiers and there would be massive
                    confrontations and bloodshed. The election count would be called off. It would
                    be the last opportunity to fix the results.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Barnes corroborated this report and determined that it was a plausible
                    threat. So on the Sunday before the election he had the Chilean ambassador to
                    the U.S. called in. Our officials in Washington told the envoy bluntly that if
                    anything happened to disrupt the election, the U.S. president would denounce it
                    in the loudest possible terms around the world and that nothing of that kind
                    would be tolerated. Apparently, our counter-threat was effective. We later heard
                    from members of the junta that the stop-the-election plan was real. Another
                    decisive moment happened when the first election results came in. Sergio Jarpa,
                    the leader of the conservative National party and a previous supporter of
                    Pinochet, went public and stated that the no vote had won. Junta members Stange
                    and Matthei also said so publicly.</p>

                <p>ROE: After the election? There was a joyous feeling of release and celebration
                    nationwide. People felt that Chile had been saved from a terrible path of social
                    and political warfare that would permanently scar the society. The talk turned
                    to reconciliation — what would happen when they finally return to democratic
                    government, could unearth the truth about the dirty war, and take steps to heal
                    the wounds. Pinochet conceded in a dazed, semi-defiant, somewhat disoriented
                    speech.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>Chileans began planning for the national elections in December of '89.
                    Concertaci�n candidate Patricio Aylwin (Christian Democrats) won decisively,
                    heading the first democratically elected government in 16 years. At that point
                    you had an outpouring of positive energy. People felt they had begun to overcome
                    the darkest part of their recent history. The opposition leaders wanted the
                    world to know they were not about vengeance or divisiveness. They didn't act
                    triumphant, because no one, not even the old-line communists, wanted the country
                    to suffer more suicidal feuding. Pinochet had received forty-four to their
                    fifty-six percent in the plebiscite. He remained as army commander. His
                    constitution set strong limits on the democratic process. A portion of the
                    Congress was appointed, and the President could not remove the Commander in
                    Chief of the Armed Forces.</p>

                <p>Four years in Chile provided a unique opportunity to set down roots and develop
                    lifelong friendships. Marie Snyder (now Cavanagh), was librarian at the American
                    school, Nido de Aguilas. When her parents visited Chile, we traveled with them
                    to Punta Arenas and Torres de Paine, an incredible World Heritage site in the
                    south that contains glaciers and flamingos within the same national park.
                    Another time Marie and I explored the Valle del Elqui in the north and visited a
                    monastery that seemed lost in time. This is the narrow valley where many
                    reported UFO sightings have happened. The poet and diplomat Gabriela Mistral —
                    the first in Latin America to win a Nobel Prize for literaturwas born there.
                    Pancho Ingunza, a decorator and arts empresario, and Juta Gaviria, a German
                    designer, were close friends who opened many doors. John Acton, the DCM for the
                    Australian Embassy in Santiago, was another inspired buddwe took tango lessons
                    together, and he later visited us in the U.S. and Budapest.</p>
                <p>Chile remains a big part of my life because I have family ties as well. In late
                    1988 I became engaged to a Chilean, Hector Bravo Zu�iga. We had to go through a
                    mountain of red tape to get Department approval. After the wedding in February
                    '89, we started the immigration process. That was another transformation in a
                    year full of them.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>We were married in Hector's hometown, Nuevo Imperial, in a ceremony attended by
                    his extended family and childhood friends, my older sister Becky and her husband
                    Andy from Colorado, the political counselor Ron Godard and his family, Heather
                    Walker (British) and Yolande Osten (Dutch). Hector's mother Nila was there,
                    along with six of his siblings, twenty-one of her grandchildren and many
                    neighbors. My close Chilean friends — Pancho Ingunza and Felipe Gopeigui —
                    decorated the banquet hall. The town had only one restaurant and no hotel, so
                    arrangements were quite a challenge. Hector's uncle Juan donated the beef from
                    his farm. A firefighter friend was chef, serving a four course meal. We were
                    setting up until an hour before the ceremony.</p>

                    years before that. Hector was born in the south of Chile near Temuco in the
                    Ninth Region. This was Indian country, a rural area that was ninety-five percent
                    Mapuche. He went to a bi-lingual school started by a Mapuche schoolteacher and
                    activist, Carlos Santiba�ez. His parents were small farmers who took care of the
                    pine plantations for the larger landholders and later for the government. His
                    father, Guillermo Bravo Leal, was the voluntary veterinarian for all the
                    neighboring farms. He died in 1977, the same year as my father. Hector had
                    thirteen brothers and sisters, and four half-brothers and sisters. His mother,
                    Nila Zu�iga, was madrina (godmother) for half of the province. One brother,
                    Ramon, still lives in the family farm. Until recently, the house had no indoor
                    plumbing or electricity. Water came from a hand-drawn well. The homestead lies
                    about an hour from town by dirt road, set among rolling green hills.</p>
                <p>Hector and I met when I asked for someone from Diplomatic Security to accompany
                    me to a poblaci�n (slum) outside Santiago called Cardinal Fresno. I needed to go
                    there to meet a family whose son was bitten by Bronco, the nine-year old German
                    shepherd I'd just adopted. I paid the mother a hefty indemnity. She and her
                    other children had nothing but a roof and a dirt floor. They depended on her
                    son's work at the local market. They were grateful for the visit and the money.
                    It was a look behind the scenes at the hard luck base of Chile's resistance
                    movement. The poblaci�n was off limits to official Santiago. None of Pinochet's
                    army or police would venture there. But Hector had worked in rougher areas as a
                    police officer, and neither of us felt any tension being there.</p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>Hector and I share an interest in Mapuche culture, their history, community
                    rituals, ceremonial music, healing practices. One of Hector's aunts, T�a Juana,
                    married a Mapuche and ran her own farm. In her 50s she became a one-woman
                    hospice and continued doing that work for nearly a half a century. When someone
                    was terminally ill and dying, the family would summon her to help them make the
                    passage peacefully. Juana is buried in a Mapuche cemetery near the family
                    homestead and the locals consider her a saint. Hector's childhood gave him the
                    taste for living in two culturethe Embassy was a third. He looked forward to
                    exploring the land of Israel. But he never left his home behind. Many a morning
                    I wake up to hear Hector recounting the latest stories from his sister Natalia
                    or his brother Ramon; a prayer or song from his childhood; the names and family
                    lines of neighboring Mapuche machis (medicine women) and matriarchs; or country
                    legends like the ghost fox, the Tu� Tu�, the spirit owl, the night fireballs. He
                    has a detective's eye for details and my mother's gift for remembering
                    relationships. He never fails to stop on the highway to help a stranger with a
                    car breakdown or to rescue an injured animal or bird.</p>
                <p>Before turning to Israel, two stories. One happened in September 1988, just
                    before the Chilean plebiscite. Nancy Mason, a new political/military officer,
                    had just arrived at post. Around 5 p.m., most of the political section vacated —
                    a pro-Pinochet demonstration was scheduled to take place a half hour later at La
                    Moneda palace, just up the street from the Embassy. I was finishing a cable and
                    told Nancy, “No problem, I'll take you.” We left fifteen minutes later but to
                    our dismay, we saw the large crowd fleeing in panic toward Avenida O'Higgins,
                    the main thoroughfare in downtown Santiago. “Don't worry,” I told Nancy, “we'll
                    take the metro home.” But the metro was closed. As people ran up main street, we
                    felt like we'd hit a wall. It was a wall of tear gas. We escaped to the side
                    streets but still couldn't see our way out. Eventually a stranger offered to
                    give us a ride home, and we followed him thinking there was strength in
                    numberthe two of us against him if necessary. When we got in his Peugeot, he
                    showed us the chains and revolver he stashed on the passenger side of the front
                    seat. “I'm one of the counter-demonstrators,” he proudly said. So a Pinochet
                    partisan took us home that night, all because I'd boasted, “no problem.”</p>
                <p>Another indelible memory is the night of the October 1988 plebiscite. Ambassador
                    Barnes had confronted Pinochet's envoys on the issue of a staged disruption.
                    During the day the political section and other officers monitored different
                    polling places. A big international observer corps was already in placthe
                    Europeans, the National Endowment for Democracy, the National Republican
                    Institute, the National Democratic Institute and hundreds of journalists. Ron
                    Godard, the new political counselor, had put together a briefing manual for
                    those observers and was coordinating Embassy responses. By the afternoon, spot
                    checks indicated the election was proceeding peacefully, but no one knew how the
                    government would deal with the results. That evening, I was the only officer
                    covering the election from outside the Embassy. I went from political party
                    headquarters to headquarters, taking the temperature, talking with party
                    activists.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>I was at the Christian Democratic headquarters when conservative leader Sergio
                    Jarpa announced that he accepted the election results. There was an outburst of
                    joy. Shortly afterward, Air Force Commander General Matthei followed suit,
                    legitimizing the returns. The government had blockaded routes within the city
                    center, making it nearly impossible to circulate within Santiago. However the
                    Embassy driver was undeterred. We talked our way past five of the police
                    barricades, making up many different storiethat I was sick and had to reach my
                    doctor, or I needed to deliver a message from the U.S. Ambassador to someone in
                    the headquarters, and so on. I arrived at the opposition's central command on
                    Avenida Alemeda just as the Coordinadora burst into cheers over the news that
                    the election results were irreversible. I remember giving Lagos a hug.</p>

                    Mike Metrinko, the consul general, had been one of the hostages in Tehran during

                <p>ROE: Israeli-U.S. relations have been intertwined since the creation of the State
                    of Israel in 1948. The U.S. is Israel's largest trading partner. We carry out
                    joint military planning exercises. We have cooperative institutions in many
                    scientific and technical areas. The political and cultural ties are so close we
                    sometimes seem like members of the same family. Tel Aviv is one of the “special
                    relationship” posts like Mexico City and London where you have a galaxy of eyes
                    watching everything you do, and the policy is mostly determined out of
                    Washington.</p>

                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>ROE: Histadrut (the Israeli labor federation) has been a major player in the
                    country's economy and political landscape since the earliest days of
                    nation-building. It's a trade union and social movement, but also the largest
                    employer after the government. Histadrut has operated the largest industrial
                    conglomerates, the second largest bank, the transportation and building trades
                    and insurance enterprises. Several of these firms including Koor were in fiscal
                    crisis. Histadrut ran the biggest national health care and day care services. It
                    coordinated the agricultural cooperativethe iconic kibbutzim and moshaviwhich
                    were also facing tough times. Its regional institutes cultivate strong
                    connections with developing countries especially in Africa and Latin America. In
                    1989 the federation represented nearly 60 percent of the adult population. Its
                    1.6 million members included 247,000 Israeli Arabs and Druze. Some 15 percent of
                    the Histadrut are non-Jews. Housewives belong as well as students.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't have to have a job to join it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: It's like a big tent. The day workers who come from Gaza and the West Bank
                    pay discounted Histadrut dues and are entitled to representation on the job, but
                    since they're not legal residents, they couldn't be members. The federation
                    mirrors Israeli society and consciousness. Shortly after I arrived, I monitored
                    the Histadrut national elections in November 1989. Israeli political parties
                    contested the elections to Histadrut's leadership conference as well as to the
                    72 local labor councils. These contests were closely watched as a bellwether for
                    the parliamentary elections of 1990. I recruited Aubrey Hooks, the top econ
                    officer, to join me in covering the balloting. He's a Hebrew speaker, and the
                    process fascinated him.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Whither Aubrey Hooks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: The Hooks were my sponsors in Tel Aviv. Aubrey went on to be consul general
                    and DCM in Warsaw and is currently Ambassador in Azerbaijan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of this labor federation? You
                        have something that's a huge organization, delving into all sorts of social
                        activities. How effective is it and how bureaucratic has it become and does
                        it deliver?</hi>

                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>ROE: When Labor Zionists led by David Ben-Gurion developed a centralized economic
                    infrastructure to support the new state of Israel, they made Histadrut into a
                    quasi-state institution. Over time the organization had become ossified and
                    deeply indebted. Histadrut General Secretary Israel Kessar was a Labor Party
                    leader and a member of the Knesset (Israeli Parliament). Going to call on him
                    was almost like calling on the president of the country. Kessar was an Israeli
                    Yemenite, the first non-Ashkenazi to be elected to this key position. He and
                    many of his officers didn't speak English. I hadn't received Hebrew training,
                    except for a few classes I took at the end of my tour in Santiago. At formal
                    meetings we spoke through an interpreter, who often put his own spin on the
                    conversation. My position was not language-designated, and I strongly
                    recommended that this be changed. Later it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a reason for this? Was Histadrut a stronghold of
                        the Zionist movement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: Historically, yes. The old guard of Histadrut was the successor generation
                    to the Mapai, the Zionist father of the modern Labor party. You had interlocking
                    directorates between Mapai and Histadrut, although this started to break down in
                    the 1970s and 80s. Labor was losing its hegemony as the dominant political party
                    with successive waves of Sephardic immigrants. Unlike the Ashkenazim, the
                    Sephardim were not from northern and eastern Europe and Russia. Many are
                    descended from Jews who were exiled from Spain in the 1400s and settled in
                    Turkey, southeastern Europe, North Africa and other Middle Eastern
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Such as Yemen and Morocco—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: Yes. Originally, Ashkenazi meant a person who spoke Yiddish, a dialect of
                    German, and Sephardim meant someone who spoke Ladino, the ancient Judeo-Spanish
                    dialect. Many of the older generation still converse in Ladino. It's a beautiful
                    language that helped my husband and I connect with many Israelis of this
                    heritage.</p>
                <p>Histadrut was like an overgrown, paternalistic company. Like Israel itself, it
                    was troubled, defensive, fractious, composed of hundreds of little kiosks run by
                    resourceful technicians, intellectuals and political survivors who are
                    internationalists at heart. One of the more interesting parts of Histadrut is
                    its African institute that has trained local activists and supports local
                    movements for democratic change throughout the continent. Histadrut was crying
                    out for reform. In June 1989, the federation approved a reform blueprint written
                    by Professor Avraham Friedman that called for privatizing many of the
                    Histadrut-owned enterprises and building a more horizontal, democratic trade
                    union structure. Not surprisingly, implementation of the plan was stalled.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>Another thorny issue was the relationship of Histadrut to West Bank and Gaza
                    workers. Before my assignment, the Department raised the idea of a dialogue with
                    Palestinian unions, an issue that previous labor attach�s apparently saw as the
                    kiss of death. My trade union experience gave me confidence in encouraging the
                    initiative within Histadrut, but naturally there was resistance. Israel Kessar
                    took the stance that “we can't meet with them because the law says no dealings
                    with the PLO (Palestine Liberation Organization).” He took it for granted that
                    any Palestinian union leader would be part of the political structure and not
                    independent. Now, West Bank and Gaza workers in Israel were charged a 1 percent
                    agency fee in exchange for getting union contract and grievance representation.
                    In practice they received little protection. Unofficially, Histadrut officers
                    acknowledged that this was a compelling reason for dialogue.</p>
                <p>In March 1990 Tony Freeman, State's Special Assistant for Labor Affairs, visited
                    Israel to initiate the first high-level Department contact with Palestinian
                    unions. We coordinated the trip with the U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem.
                    Our encounters with leaders of the West Bank Palestinian Trade Union Federation
                    (WBPFTU) were memorable. In Nablus, we observed a hotly contested local union
                    election in a shoe factory and later met with WBPFTU leader Shahir Saad, whose
                    organization was founded in 1920. Saad, who defined himself as a moderate,
                    appreciated the chance to open a new door. We asked why he affiliated with the
                    ICFTU (International Confederation of Free Trade Unions) instead of the WFTUF
                    (the communist-oriented World Federation of Trade Unions). He said it was the
                    only way to go, because the ICFTU stands for democratic trade unionism and
                    peaceful social change. Saad's action's supported this stance.</p>
                <p>At the time, Saad was restricted by a travel ban. After the visit, I wrote
                    Histadrut asking for their help in lifting the ban. In August 1990, Histadrut
                    set up a legal aid office for workers from the occupied territories. Within the
                    next year, the Israeli ban on contacts with the PLO was lifted, and Histadrut
                    began a dialogue with the WBPFTU. I counted these small steps as an important
                    gain in Israel.</p>
                <p>An aside — Tony Freeman later served as Director of ILO's Washington office from
                    1994-2004. In that capacity, and after his retirement, I worked closely with him
                    on many issues including labor standards in trade legislation and worker rights

                <p>ROE: It's clear I was skating into unknown territory. Histadrut's leaders assume
                    you are on their side. When you raise new ideas, such as the need for dialogue
                    with the West Bank &amp; Gaza trade unionists, you need to be very insistent
                    that you're speaking for the U.S. government. Whether in an informal lunch
                    meeting with Israel Kessar and his colleagues or an official state visit, every
                    word is carefully weighed and registered.</p>
                <p>The Middle Eastern area studies program at FSI helped me do some soul-searching.
                    I identified strongly with the Jewish experience. In 1974, a year after the Yom
                    Kippur war, when I first visited Israel, it was a different country. Back then I
                    had wondered if the U.S. policy of even-handedness was fair, and if we shouldn't
                    do more to support Israel. Then in 1989 I read Tom Friedman's book From Beirut
                    to Jerusalem. The book and my Israel experience were eye-openers. Twenty-three
                    years of occupation had transformed the country. Both Israelis and Palestinians
                    seemed to be living on a knife's edge. The U.S. wants to be an honest broker in
                    the conflict, but we lose that standing when we don't engage consistently. It's
                    difficult to discuss the issues fairly when AIPAC is such a powerful influence
                    on the Congress and the news media.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: AIPAC is very vocal, well organized, single-minded and nationalistic. Many
                    believe this lobby does not speak for the mainstream of American Jewry. Its
                    saber-rattling hurts those in Israel and the U.S. trying to work for peaceful
                    solutions. I worked with many U.S.-based Jewish organizations in Israel who are
                    quite critical of AIPAC's role. The situation with Histadrut is different.
                    They're dedicated marketeers. The Israeli labor attach� in Washington offered
                    Hector a job as an auto mechanic before he got there. The only hitch is that the
                    government wouldn't give him a work permieven though the U.S. grants work
                    permits to family members of Israeli diplomats hassle-free under our reciprocity
                    agreement. That was a telling glimpse into the country's bureaucratic labyrinth.
                    Instead, Hector worked for the Colombian ambassador, Edmundo Esquinazi.
                    Esquinazi was a self-made millionaire, a Turkish-born Sephardic Jew who found
                    Israeli culture and business dealings to be challenging in extremis. He was
                    generous with his staff, and couldn't do enough for Hector.</p>

                        This goes back from the very beginning of labor history. Did you find that
                        the Jewish element within the labor movement had a thrust that was different
                        than AIPAC or was it a creature of AIPAC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: The AFL-CIO is no pawn of AIPAC, and I've always felt that Jewish
                    intellectual input in laboin any organizatiois a real strength. Under AFL-CIO
                    presidents Meany and Kirkland and now Sweeney, American labor has been very
                    engaged on the Israel issue. This stems from labor's World War II era efforts to
                    help resettle and rescue refugees, especially those threatened by the Holocaust.
                    My experience gave me the sense that the occupation was eroding Israel's
                    identity. Not many in the AFL-CIO leadership shared that view, but then again,
                    American labor is not monolithic.</p>
                <p>Shortly before my assignment started, the CWA (the Communication Workers

                    participation. Our consul general in Jerusalem said if I attended it would imply
                    U.S. support for moving the Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem (a long-standing
                    Israeli goal). I quickly learned how sensitive these issues can be. AFL-CIO

                    West Bank unions with the consulate. Relations with the consul general (CG) were
                    testy at first, because I started out by pressing for answers concerning the CWA

                </p>
                <p>ROE: Yes. The intifada (the Palestinian uprising against the occupation) began in
                    the late 1980s, adding fuel to an already grim, conflictive situation. In 1990
                    over 100,000 Arab workers from the occupied territories worked in Israel. Their
                    labor rights were barely protected and their movements frequently restricted for
                    security reasons. Arab labor contributed to Israel's prosperity. Palestinians
                    watched the growth of Israeli settlements that lock in the occupation, making
                    them exiles from their own land. More are turning to the politics of
                    vengeance.</p>
                <p>Israeli Arabs have their own political parties in the Knesset and their own
                    caucus within the Labor Party. They comprise nearly twenty percent of the
                    population and make up over fifteen percent of Histadrut membership. The U.S.
                    Information Service (USIS) had a traveling library that regularly visited Arab
                    villages in Israel. They would invite me to talk on safety net programs in the
                    U.S., how the social security system works, the status of Arab-Americans in the
                    U.S., and other socio-economic issues. Back then, most Israeli Arabs had a
                    cordial regard for the U.S. and some understanding of our role in the Middle
                    East. They identified with the Palestinian cause, but felt rooted in Israel.
                    They faced a lot of discrimination, and their towns had scant resources.
                    Arab-speaking and Jewish children could not attend school together.</p>
                <p>Richard Israelovitch, the senior social scientist at Beersheba University,
                    invited me to visit the campus. Richard directed the Israeli bird watching
                    society and also headed the Hubert Humphrey Institute at the university. His
                    associate, Ismael Abu Saad, was the only Bedouin in Israel to earn a
                    post-doctoral degree. Ismael's wife Kathy was a leader in the human rights
                    association fighting for the rights of Bedouins. Hector and I went to Abu Saad's
                    brother's wedding during our last weekend in Israel and observed something I'll
                    never forget. When we arrived at the wedding which was in a small town near
                    Beersheba, we saw a lot of camels in a tiny plot. Their owners, who were
                    relatives of the Saads, had a parcel of land to the south of Tel Aviv. The
                    husband was doing business outside of Tel Aviv, and his wife was manning their
                    shop in the market near where they lived. Without warning, the Israeli “green
                    police” came along and forced them to take all their animals and return to their
                    relatives' place in Beersheba. The authorities claimed the family had no rights
                    to the land, even though they owned clear title. The Israelis not only
                    forcefully moved them, but also make them pay exorbitantly for the
                    transportation of the camels and other livestock. Near the wedding site we also
                    saw some olive trees, and learned that those too were condemned to be destroyed
                    by the state. The Israelis regularly uproot the olive trees that are not grown
                    expressly with their permission. These cases go through the courts, but very
                    slowly.</p>

                    indignity and economic damage they've experienced. The Israelis are proud of
                    making the desert bloom, but in carrying out these policies they destroy a
                    precious natural resource on which people depend. The irony is that Bedouins
                    played key roles in several Israeli victories against the Arab states. These
                    policies seem guaranteed to turn them into enemies.</p>

                        who was in Israel, an American. One you have this natural affinity towards
                        Israeli, plucky little state, very modern, with the terrible experience of
                        the Holocaust as a backdrop. Politically it's dynamite if you try to oppose
                        it, but the other, but on the other hand you've got this problem of the
                        Israelis being beastly to the Arabs. I mean one can't help but think of
                        South Africa in the time of apartheid. The other one is that Israel seems to
                        be able to lead the United States along by a leash practically when because
                        of the political clout within the American political system.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: What I witnessed was a state of mutual fear, stoked by the Palestinians'
                    blind support for violent solutions and Israeli's exercise of lordly might. The
                    government of Israel effectively plays our system and knows our weaknesses, but
                    we're responsible for our mistakes. Our Congressional leaders seem to assume
                    that unless we stand pat, everything will fall apart. But Israel has grown
                    beyond its infancy. Some of the most astute commentators I found were in
                    military intelligencmen like Efraim Halevy, who headed the Mossad from
                    1998-2003. They saw the deadly consequences of continuing the status quo with
                    the occupied territories. Americans feel ambivalent about Israeloving its can-do
                    spirit and heroic accomplishments but uncomfortable with its present. Israelis
                    seem even more divided about their role. They've been heatedly debating the
                    issue for years, without fear of censorship. Take the question of the billion
                    dollar blank check the U.S. writes to Israel each year. Many Israelis feel this
                    aid is corrupting their country from within, creating dependencies, postponing
                    hard decisions about internal reforms. Yet it continues because U.S.
                    policymakers can't bring themselves to question the process.</p>
                <p>I saw Israelis struggling with the implications of being an occupying country. An
                    Israeli think tank called the West Bank Data Project did excellent research on
                    policies that could change the equation with the Palestinians. They criticized
                    Israel's post-statehood practice of changing place names to eradicate any
                    history of Palestinian settlement. Attorney General Michael Ben-Yair wrote that
                    after the Six-Day War that Israel “enthusiastically chose to become a colonial
                    society, ignoring international treaties, expropriating land, transferring
                    settlers from Israel to the occupied territories, engaging in theft and finding
                    justification for all these activities.” Excessively strong words, maybe — but
                    most Israelis found that living through the ethnic conflict created a constant
                    tension, like a fault line forming under the simplest of everyday
                    interactions.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>Israel's technocratic and business leaders also understood their country couldn't
                    sustain growth in a climate of Balkan-style ethnic conflict. After two decades
                    on the margins, the peace movement was gaining mainstream potency. Some of those
                    participating were industrial leaders and military leaders, including prominent
                    women army officers who simply could not justify Israel's foreign policy. This
                    was no bedraggled minority. Not long after I left Yitzhak Rabin became Prime
                    Minister, raising hopes for reform.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: I would have liked to see closer cooperation between the human rights and
                    labor functions. I had more support from the economic section and USIS, which
                    were less fragmented and closed off than the political section. The political
                    counselor, John Becker and the deputy polcon, Ted Feifer, were savvy, thoughtful
                    officers, both very different in style but great colleagues. The problem was
                    structural. We were like a microcosm of Israel's splintered bureaucracy. We
                    worked in a section of Tel Aviv that used to be the red light district. It was a
                    little slum of a chancery, and when I asked if it had always been this way, many
                    would say, “Oh, we hardly notice, because we came from Embassy Moscow, which is
                    the real pits.” Each part of the political section was locked off in a separate
                    office. These were the last years of the WANG operating system. To send a
                    classified cable, you had to lock your office, go into the main political
                    section and enter a cold storage room that looked like a NASA (National Air and
                    Space Administration) command center. To shut it down took about twenty-five
                    operations at night. This setup and the frenetic climate of Tel Aviv impacted
                    the work environment. One Israeli contact told me that living there was like
                    being on an electric shock bed.</p>

                    light to settlements. The Administration exerted its financial leverage to deter
                    the settlements. I think Israelis got the message. George H.W. Bush, the father,
                    took the view that Israelis were sabotaging themselves with the settlement
                    activity and losing their international credibility. Israelis pushed back hard;
                    still, they understood our need to play an independent role. But the
                    assassination of Yitzhak Rabin shattered the peace effort and traumatized the
                    Israeli reform movement. The revelation that his killer was a right-wing Israeli
                    fanatic shocked the national psyche. That wound has yet to heal.</p>

                <p>ROE: Immigration affected everyone. Israelis were making heroic efforts to absorb
                    the rising stream of immigrants. Soviet immigration reached record number184,000
                    in 1990, up from 13,000 the previous year. The government and Histadrut were
                    preparing for another wave of immigrants from Ethiopia. They were processing
                    newcomers in huge absorption centers, providing Hebrew literacy, cultural
                    orientation and training for the job market. The incorporation of what would be
                    a million more immigrants by the mid-1990's was a huge challenge. Unemployment
                    was increasing. It had reached a twenty year high of 9.6 percent in 1990. But
                    somehow the Israeli economy managed to absorb that great immigrant wave. It's a
                    high tech economy, and the Israeli safety net and brainpower resources make the
                    system resilient. The immigrants generated new demands and new jobs. Still,
                    Ethiopians face discrimination in the workplace. Those of Jewish descent were
                    called Falashas (outsiders) in Ethiopia. Many who came to Israel still felt like
                    outsiders.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: They're part of a deep divide in Israeli political life. Because of this
                    polarization, no party can get a majority. Labor Zionism made the State of
                    Israel into a kind of civil religion. The new religious partlike Shas — looks
                    down on secularism. They want to enthrone their view of traditional Judaism
                    within the state and implicitly press a relentless territorial agenda. The
                    ultranationalist religious have weight beyond their numbers, and some of the
                    fringe groups are really fanatic. These zealots connect the settlement of the
                    West Banthe Biblical Judea and Samarito the advent of the Messiah. Their pursuit
                    of a theocracy parallels the goals of the Islamic jihadists. In one
                    neighborhood, shortly after I arrived, a kiosk owner sold newspapers that
                    offended one religious party. Party supporters burned down his store and killed
                    him. This ultranationalist movement gave rise to a terrorist underground that
                    carried out several attacks on West Bank Arab mayors in the 1980's. They planned
                    to destroy the Dome of the Rock mosque in Jerusalem. This fervor led to the
                    assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, opening the way to the collapse of the peace
                    process and the second intifada in 2000.</p>

                    still low. During the November 1989 elections, the Labor list won 55 percent.
                    Kessar drew on a few of the more moderate religious parties for his winning
                    coalition. Likud won only 27 percent, just short of the 30 percent it would take

                    Histadrut is embedded in local communities, because of the multiple services it
                    offers and its history. It's not perceived as a separate, underdog movement like

                    and the touring that Hector and I did in our spare moments. I'll never forget

                    strangers on Passover and the joy with which they rekindled their traditions. Or
                    the beauty of Safed, the Sea of Galilee and the archeological treasures in out

                    At dawn on May 30, PLO terrorists launched a mini-tanker with half a dozen
                    speedboats from Libya in an effort to attack Tel Aviv's town hall and beachfront
                    hotels. Five of them attempted to board the beach at Herzliya, the suburban
                    township where we lived.</p>

                <p>ROE: A Navy gun goat patrolling off Tel Aviv spotted the first boat and made the
                    raiders surrender. Then the Air Force, Navy and police went on high alert. The
                    IDF killed several raiders and rounded up the rest employing attack helicopters
                    and spotter planes. The Israelis had apparently had some advance warning, much
                    earlier, but without specifics. The terrorist also had problems with several of
                    their boats breaking down. As the IDF (Israeli Defense Force) was
                    counter-attacking, the RSO whisked off U.S. Ambassador Brown to safety. However,
                    the Embassy took no steps to warn American citizens away from the beach or
                    protect them. This generated angry responses from several diplomats' families,
                    including the economic counselor. Israelis were also shocked. Few had imagined
                    the beaches would be a front line in the intifada.</p>

                <p>This took place as I was being reassigned to Colombia. In April I bid on the
                    labor counselor vacancy in Mexico, a senior position. Ambassador Brown wrote a
                    cable supporting my bid. U.S. Ambassador to Mexico John Negroponte backed me. I
                    was about to be paneled, but the Director General nixed the assignment because
                    it was a two grade hike. Then our DCM called from Bogot�. The deputy political
                    counselor had become a hard to fill position, because families had been
                    evacuated in 1989 due to terrorist threats. Even though families were returning,
                    officers were reluctant to sign on because they knew the security situation
                    could change again. Colombia was gearing up for a constituent assembly which
                    could have a big impact on the country's future and U.S. policy interests.
                    Monitoring the assembly would be my main focus. So I took that assignment.</p>

                <p>ROE: The climate was a bit spooky. Embassy staff left for work in an armored
                    vehicle with an armed follow car in a shifting schedule that would range from
                    five to eight in the morning. The guards got out at every stop and flaunted
                    their machine guns. Ironically, if we went home late, we were on our own. So
                    more often than not I took public transportation home. Go figure! Colombia had
                    its share of upheavals. Luis Carlos Gal�n, a beloved reformer and the leading
                    candidate for President, had just been assassinated on the campaign trail. He
                    was a Robert Kennedy type figure. Cesar Gaviria, Gal�n's campaign manager, was

                <p>ROE: Himself. The drug cartels of Medellin and Cali had tremendous power. The

                    ELN (Ejercito de Liberaci�n Nacional) controlled significant parts of the
                    countryside. The M-19 (Movimiento 19 de Abril) and the EPL (Ejercito Popular de
                    Liberaci�n) responded to the peace overture of the previous government to lay
                    down their arms and become part of the political process. They were a both small
                    movements. The M-19 achieved dark fame with its bloody seizure of the Palace of
                    Justice in 1985. They moderated their actions after 1987 and eventually became
                    seriously engaged in the political process. I'd been exposed to little positive
                    about Colombia before moving there, but the country grew on me. Colombians, like
                    Chileans, are highly educated. Their intelligentsia has strong ties with Western
                    Europe, particularly Spain. The government's common cause with the U.S. in
                    battling the drug lords created new connections.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: The trade union movement was weak and highly politicized. A relatively
                    larger confederation, the CUT (Central Unit�rio Colombiano), included the main
                    political tendencies as well as the small Communist party. Of the two smaller
                    confederations, one had a fairly close relationship with the AFL-CIO. The
                    Embassy had no contact with the CUT. There was a modest-sized AIFLD (American
                    Institute for Free Labor Development) project with an able Colombian
                    coordinator, Guillermo Virracach�. Guillermo had informal relations with all the
                    confederations. Unfortunately, the leaders of the federation in AFL-CIO's sphere
                    were patriarchal and most likely had ties to the drug mafia. Instead, I
                    cultivated close contacts with the CUT. When I traveled to the provinces or
                    explored a labor issue, their affiliates would often be helpful. The CUT
                    secretary general, Jorge Castillo, later became the chief labor advisor to
                    Alvaro Uribe. Our central concerns were the endemic violence in the labor
                    sector, the blacklisting and lack of protection for those trying to organize,
                    and widespread discrimination against women workers and other minorities,
                    including Afro-Colombians and indigenous workers. We also worked with industrial
                    relations experts and human resource officers to help promote best practices in
                    labor-management cooperation.</p>
                <p>President Gav�ria's boldest initiative was a participatory movement to rewrite
                    Colombia's constitution for the first time in 105 years. This was a risky
                    venture with major implications for U.S. extradition policy as well as for
                    Colombia's chances for political stability and a whole subset of social equity
                    issues. The U.S. was worried the drug lords would seize control of the
                    process.</p>

                <p>Elections to the Constituent Assembly took place in the fall of 1990. The
                    delegates were everyone from poets to housewives to people to new political
                    party activists, ex-guerrillas, magistrates, peasants, journalists, trade
                    unionists, indigenous tribal leaders — a potpourri of Colombian society. The
                    process was wide open. Alvaro Uribe, then an independent Liberal Party Senator
                    who chaired the Labor and Social Welfare committee, was in the thick of things.
                    Uribe, who later was twice elected President of Colombia, was relatively unknown
                    to Washington. But he was a strategic player and astute observer of the
                    Constituent Assembly and became my closest contact. Fernando Carillo, who later
                    became Colombia's youngest justice minister, was another key delegate. Others
                    included young reformers like liberal Senator Fernando Botero and Eduardo Verano
                    de la Rosa and ex-guerillas like Angelino Garz�n of the M-19 (later a Labor
                    Minister under Uribe). I worked closely with Ana Maria Salazar, a gifted
                    Mexican-American attorney and AID contractor who steered the Agency's justice
                    reform project. Following this stint, she became Deputy Assistance Secretary in
                    the Defense Department, and is now teaching in Mexico. During the AC we compared
                    notes on a daily basis.</p>

                    eight months of intense negotiations. The new constitution prohibited
                    discrimination against women workers, child labor, indigenous peoples and other
                    minorities. It incorporated the ratified ILO conventions and recognized the
                    right to strike for non-essential public employees. A fairly comprehensive labor
                    code reform passed in 1990 increased the fines for interference with trade union
                    activity —</p>

                    will open up to someone who grasps something of their history and appreciates
                    the risks they confront. A lot of people who don't understand Colombia wonder

                    violence.” Many would take risks we couldn't imagine. A prosecutor, judge,
                    journalist, mayor or independent political figure realized that any point he or
                    she could be kidnapped or knocked off, and that happened with grim frequency.
                    They saw colleagues gunned down doing their work, some right in the halls of the
                    university. Business people pooled their resources for rescue funds because they

                        jail, it was going to put a crimp in that export. How did this play in

                </p>
                <p>ROE: This was a heated issue in the Constituent Assembly. We lost ground, though
                    less than anticipated; several years later Colombia passed legislation
                    legalizing extradition again. Attitudes were shifting. Colombians were becoming
                    more conscious of the social costs of drug addiction and cocaine production,
                    particularly as it affects Colombian youth, rural communities, and the economy
                    as a whole. There's widespread skepticism whether we're using the right approach
                    to the problem. One U.S. officer directing the Embassy's anti-narcotics program
                    acknowledged that if we spent a portion of the drug war budget on programs to
                    help get homeless kids off the streets of Bogot� and on rehabilitation in the
                    U.S., it would generate far better results. As long as the U.S. and European
                    demand for drugs keeps up, the trade may shift geographically, but it will stay
                    alive and healthy.</p>

                <p>ROE: In the end prohibition never works, it just increases the street price and
                    the Mafia's power. But politically, the more holistic solutions you see in
                    countries like the Netherlands are dead on arrival in our Congress. Many
                    Colombians see the issue as a struggle to ensure that drug lords don't own large
                    sections of the country, that guerillas and paramilitaries don't destroy the
                    countryside through constant violence and counter violence. They're trying to
                    come out of a very dark period. Inside the labor community, I found common
                    ground on issues where the U.S. is trying to advance worker rights and human
                    rights implementation. The paramilitary groups are a major threat. Hundreds of
                    trade unionists have been murdered and disappeared since the mid-90s by groups
                    with shadowy ties to local and national security forces.</p>

                        Cali?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: I traveled whenever possible to the hinterlands, but not to Cali. Once I
                    joined Ambassador McNamara on a trip to Medellin, the first visit a U.S. chief
                    of mission had made there in over a decade. I set up a separate schedule of
                    meetings. Alvaro Uribe's close friend Antonio Yepes Parra, a former Antioquian
                    governor, medical doctor and constituyente, met us in the mayor's office, and
                    took me around in his beat-up car to meet local council delegates, employers,
                    academics, and other civil society organizations. I felt safer than if I had
                    gone in an Embassy van. Medellin is a beautiful, haunting city that was just
                    starting to regain its footing. Unemployment was hig14 percenand the government
                    was beginning to do something about the decrepit public education system.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>Hector and I traveled a lot in our free time. We visited Villa de Leyba, a
                    colonial city that takes you back in time, where dinosaur bones crop up on the
                    outskirts of town. We loved Cartagena, the walled colonial city on the Atlantic
                    that's very Caribbean in feeling but also struggling with strapped schools and a
                    grim job market. Bucaramanga, where the Embassy had a binational center, also
                    saw significant guerrilla activity. I traveled there several times. In my spare
                    time I visited Leticia, in the Colombian Amazon. On several occasions I joined
                    the military flights to places that weren't safely accessible except by plane.
                    One was Buenaventura, the Pacific port, where I met with a fisherman's family
                    that lived at the wharfs. They were dirt-poor. The whole population was
                    suffering as the big Japanese and Russian trawlers were drastically reducing the
                    fish stocks. A large crowd of children gathered around me. The local taxi driver
                    who had driven me there was worried stiff I was risking my life by venturing
                    near the docks. But the danger wasn't minit was their lives of silent
                    desperation.</p>
                <p>I went to Pasto, near the Ecuador border, on fact-finding trips. Galeras, the
                    large volcano west of town, was supposedly dormant. There's a small scientific
                    observatory near the crater at over 4000 meters. I hiked up to the rim on very
                    loose soil and peered down into the cauldron, wondering why it was smoking so
                    much. The Pasta�os told me, “Oh it does that all the time.” Six months later the
                    Galeras volcano erupted and killed six vulcanologists. Navarro Wolff,
                    ex-guerrilla and minister of health during my tour, later became mayor of Pasto
                    and won national awards several years in a row for attacking corruption in the
                    city.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: The drug issue was not the only focus, just the elephant in the room. The
                    criminality fueled by the drug trade is like an occupying power. It undermines
                    the rule of law and fragile democratic structures. It replaces local harvests
                    with cash crops that cause addiction and death. It threatens the extinction of
                    Indian tribes. Indigenous leaders that resist the drug gangs that cut down their
                    forest are killed. In other areas the narcos corrupt members of the tribe by
                    giving the young men motorcycles and guns. This totally undermines the authority
                    of the elders. Rural villagers get caught in the crossfire between the
                    guerrillas and the paramilitary thugs, two forces that finance themselves with
                    drug money. Many drug processing places operate a form of slave labor. They
                    recruit young people telling them they'll earn big money and will be free to go
                    home on weekends. When they try to contact their families, their overseers kill
                    them and dump their bodies in the river. Many who operate the homemade cocaine
                    processing labs die in explosions caused by the chemical reactions.</p>

                <p>Human rights issues constituted the other major U.S. government focus involving
                    close, day to day scrutiny by our Congress and by international NGOs. AID and
                    the Justice Department were cooperating in a long term effort to strengthen the
                    antiquated judiciary and promote reforms. The1991 constitution created a series
                    of new judicial institutiona Constitutional Court, an independent judiciary,
                    specialized public order courts, and a government watchdog office, the “fiscal
                    general.” Gustavo de Greiff, the highly respected jurist who became the first
                    fiscal general (attorney general), said the reforms must work because “impunity
                    keeps us from living a civilized life.” During 1992 I monitored the
                    implementation of these reforms by the newly elected Congress and Constitutional
                    Court.</p>

                        a film some time ago about the cut flower business. Cut flowers are
                        beautiful, but they have a lot of chemicals. Young women go out and work in
                        those areas with all those chemicals around. Is that a problem? Did you get

                </p>
                <p>ROE: Not during that assignment. These issues emerged more recently, with Ecuador
                    as a major focus for those concerned about conditions in the cut flower
                    industry. Edmundo Esquinazi, the former Colombian ambassador to Israel, was one
                    of those involved in the flower business. He had a strong social conscience.
                    Hector knew Esquinazi well from the time they worked together in Israel. He
                    visited the farm and reported that were around 40 adult men and women working
                    the flower plantations; they used protective gear and kept pesticide
                    applications to a minimum.</p>
                <p>Colombia has its share of child labor. Children work in street vending, family
                    farming, rural mining operations. Quite a few are involved in coca picking and
                    flower production. The ILO (International Labor Organization) estimates about
                    six percent of Colombian children aged 10 to 14 are in the labor force. Colombia
                    has worked with the ILO on projects to prevent child labor, especially in
                    small-scale mining. It was the first government in the region to acknowledge the
                    scope of this problem.</p>

                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>ROE: Starting in the late 1980's, Colombia experienced a renewed wave of violence
                    directed against trade unionists and other political targets. A decade later,
                    hundreds of worker representatives were being assassinated or disappeared. The
                    victims were campesino leaders, teachers, banana workers, factory advocates.
                    Hundreds of peasants also lost their lives, just for being caught between
                    warring sides. Trade unionists were often targeted by paramilitary forces that
                    were linked to rogue army and police elements. Others were killed by drug and
                    guerrilla mafias that don't tolerate anyone getting in their way. For example in
                    1991, FARC militia executed leaders of the palm workers union following mock
                    trials accusing them of helping the peace process. In the mid-'90's, the AFL-CIO
                    began sponsoring a small program through the George Meany Studies Center to get
                    high-risk trade union leaders out of Colombia for a year at a time.</p>

                <p>ROE: The movies have dramatized the violence that surrounds the drug culture,
                    depicting some of the worst nastiness on the planet. The Colombian outback
                    reminded me of the wild West of our frontier days. Parts of the country had
                    never bowed to any government authority. Until several years ago, around 70
                    percent of the countryside was under the control of the drug lords or the
                    guerrilla bands. But there so are many other sides to Colombia. In recent years
                    the government has made real strides to curb the violence and demilitarize the
                    no man's lands. It has some of the oldest universities in the Americas. Its
                    cultural life is strong, nourishing writers like Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez,
                    painters like Botero, scores of other artists and intellectuals.</p>

                <p>ROE: We had good friends in Bogota. The Embassy was a fairly convivial place to
                    work. The violence was a low background noise that made you more alert to your
                    surroundings but didn't isolate you. We had an interesting experience when
                    Hector's sons Alvaro and Gabriel were visiting from Chile one summer. A
                    Colombian friend, Daniel Quintero, was studying for his Masters while helping
                    his father run a cattle ranch several hours south of Bogota near Villeta. The
                    ranch was located in an area of sporadic guerilla activity. Daniel invited us to
                    visit the farm and a cane-extracting plant between Bogota and Villeta. I checked
                    with our security people, who considered the area safe at that time. It was
                    quite a long trip. We stayed overnight near the cane sugar plant at a hoster�a
                    with a garden chock full of monkeys and parrots and lush vegetation. Alvaro and
                    Gabriel had a blast with the pool all to themselves, and our dogs Golda and
                    Navarro splashing around with them.</p>

                <p>The next morning we left early. At 8:30 we were snaking around a mountain road
                    headed for the farm. Suddenly we came across five burned out buses. We learned
                    that guerillas from the FARC had come down from the hills, taken all the
                    passengers out, robbed them, sent them on their way and then set fire to the
                    buses. The buses were still smoldering. They were purportedly guarded by
                    Colombian policemen holding Uzis and makeshift weapons. Some were barefoot;
                    others had what looked liked homemade boots, ragtag uniforms or T-shirts and
                    jeans. Hector said quietly, “They look like guerrillas.” We never found out for
                    sure. When we returned on the same mountain pass the next day, the armed
                    “guards” were still there. They stopped us from taking a video. We photographed
                    the still-smoldering buses on the way back. We'd been saved by the clock. An

                    Organization bureau. My overseas jobs each involved work that was focused on

                    of concern that I would be stuck behind a desk. But I chose weland was lucky. My

                <p>ROE: I came back to headquarters for the first time in 1992 to head a small unit,
                    International Organization/Agriculture. IO/AG is part of the development office
                    of the International Organization Bureau (IO) which follows the UN Development
                    Program and the Rome-based UN organizations — the Food and Agricultural
                    Organization (FAO), the World Food Program (WFP) and the International Fund for
                    Agricultural Development (IFAD). My prime responsibility was serving as desk
                    officer for the FAO. With an annual budget of nearly 750 million dollars, FAO is
                    the largest specialized UN agency. When you work in rural areas in Latin America
                    and many developing regions, if you say FAO, people generally know what you're

                        looking at it from the Washington perspective. What were your

                </p>
                <p>ROE: The FAO had been run for the last two decades by Secretary-General Eduardo
                    Saouma of Lebanon, a minor despot. The organization was top heavy and
                    bureaucratized. Among his other attributes, Saouma was the most anti-American
                    chief of any UN organization. He saw himself as more powerful than most heads of
                    states. At the same time the Clinton administration was looking for alternatives
                    to the strident U.S. policy approaches that had aggravated tensions between rich
                    and poor countries within the UN system. During the Reagan years, the U.S.
                    government had withheld dues and attacked the UN as a useless organization. John
                    Bolton led the ideological charge against the UN during his two-year tenure as
                    the Bush II administration's UN Ambassador.</p>
                <p>Out of 171 FAO members, 124 are developing countries, known as the G-77. When I
                    started, the atmosphere was pretty toxic and the U.S. fairly isolated. Many
                    concerns about the UN system are valid ones. Looking at the genocide taking
                    place today in Sudan, it's clear that few of the countries of Africa and Asia or
                    more prosperous countries like India that espouse democracy are willing to stand
                    up against a fellow UN member and say, “You're committing genocide. Stop it.”
                    Nonetheless, the fire and brimstone approach had undercut our effectiveness in
                    achieving objectives at the FAO. We wanted to engage our counterparts in the UN
                    more cooperatively. State's role has been primarily to negotiate on budget
                    issues and to ensure that U.S. agencies' speak as one. The Department of
                    Agriculture has the lead on most substantive policy issues. USDA runs some joint
                    programs with the FAO and they rely on FAO's field expertise and technical
                    information for many projects. Under Bush I they had developed a closer
                    relationship with the FAO. The outgoing IO/D Director was a very polemical
                    officer, Juan Dudik-Gayoso. She was on permanent loan from AID and was married
                    to a right wing Cuban-American diplomat, Tony Gayoso, who preceded her in the
                    position. She was at odds with USDA and with most of our potential FAO allies on
                    a host of policy issues. The new Under Secretary for Global Affairs, Senator Tim
                    Wirth, was examining how the UN system was implementing Agenda 21 with a mind to
                    stimulate progress on sustainable development issues.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Agenda 21 being—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: Agenda 21 was the outcome of the first UN World Conference on Sustainable
                    Development (UNCSD) in 1990. At the close of UNCSD, the U.S. suddenly refused to
                    sign the declaration on climate change. We reversed that decision a year into
                    the Clinton administration and signed the agreement. UNCSD set out a 21-point
                    agenda to reverse environmental degradation and to protect the planet for future
                    generations through sustainable economic and social development. In short, take
                    better care of the earth and the natural systems on which people depend. A major
                    focus of Agenda 21 is sustainable agriculture and the FAO potentially can do a
                    lot to advance this goal. The organization was about to elect a new Secretary
                    General.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>FAO council meetings are similar to the UN General Assembly. They take place
                    every other year in the fall. FAO conferences are held each year in October in
                    Rome. Preparations took nearly all year. We elaborated positions on dozens of
                    issues. State developed scope papers and hashed out the budget issues. The
                    debates were intense, very technical and closely linked to the highly charged
                    issues of institutional reform.</p>
                <p>The IO deputy assistant secretary was Melinda Kimble, an economist who looked
                    with skepticism on many development programs. Her political orientation was
                    conservative, but she was keen on starting a new chapter in our approach to the
                    UN. She had served as Labor Officer in Tunisia and been Office Director for
                    Egypt, moving up through NEA (Near East Affairs) before turning to global issues
                    within State. Melinda and I worked in tandem to reach out to G-77 countries. She
                    focused on the Arabic-speaking delegates, I focused on the Latin American
                    caucus. USDA took the African and Southeast Asian countries where most of their
                    cooperative programs were based.</p>
                <p>At one point to everyone's surprise we defeated Saouma in a floor vote. It was a
                    taxpayers' revolt. The SecGen proposed to codify the rules for a special reserve
                    fund. Canada, Australia, Portugal, Great Britain and the U.S. opposed the idea.
                    We regarded it as a slush fund and fiscally irresponsible. The unspoken issue
                    was the Secretariat's total lack of consultation with the membership. China was
                    neutral, but the Latin American countries were quietly becoming disaffected. The
                    former Colombian ambassador had been one of Saouma's most outspoken supporters
                    and said publicly he had hoped and prayed that President George H.W. Bush would
                    not be reelected. The new Colombian ambassador, Ivan Marulanda, was a reformer
                    and a lieutenant of Luis Gal�n before his assassination. I partnered with him on
                    many issues. In the debate, Brazil and Colombia rose on the floor to insist that
                    FAO make decisions on sensitive issues by consensus, not fiat. Together with
                    other leading G-77 members, they mustered a vote that made Saouma withdraw his
                    proposal on the floor. That sent shock waves through the Secretariat.</p>
                <p>Soon after, Saouma's office called me saying he wanted to have a private
                    audience. I was summoned to go alone into the lion's den. This was
                    unprecedented. I consulted our delegation leaders. After mulling it over, they
                    gave the go-ahead. Saouma was flanked by two of his aides. We sipped good
                    Lebanese coffee. He said some flattering things about my efforts to get to know
                    the FAO from the inside. Without much ado, he launched into a tirade about the
                    damage done by agricultural subsidies to third world farmers. I listened and
                    said on that issue we saw eye to eye, but that I was in Rome to do my best
                    representing U.S. positions and I thought we were going to prevail. The
                    interview closed shortly after that, still cordial but with a frosty look from
                    the emperor.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>We wanted the FAO to implement a sustainable agriculture agenda and refocus on
                    the things it does best. To get there, we coordinated with NGOs and brainstormed
                    with FAO experts. Cooperation with civil society was a major priority of Tim
                    Wirth. So instead of locking up the U.S. positions in advance, we would
                    collaborate with NGO organizations like the international pesticide action
                    movement (PAM). I knocked on doors within the FAO bureaucracy. Melinda Kimble
                    and I sought out American staff members and their allies to explore their top
                    concerns and enlist their help in honing our positions. They were pleasantly
                    surprised — many said they'd been left for years to fend for themselves. Most
                    countries work hard to promote and protect their people within the UN system.
                    The U.S. as a rule doesn'we waste precious assets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this just inadvertence or was this a policy? I mean
                        when we're talking about this, we're saying the U.S. is not using its
                        influence to support its people or what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: In my experience, the U.S. uses little of its potential influence within the
                    UN. We mouth off ideologically and want to sweep the agencies clean, but more
                    often than not we ignore the people, the human capital, that make them run. It's
                    part of a larger phenomenon that feeds anti-Americanism. We're the country that
                    personifies the most in terms of people principles. We stand for freedom, human
                    rights and open systems, for letting people's voices be heard within the
                    governance process. But in arenas like the UN, we too often act like a rather
                    forgetful and petty power. If we don't get our way in the first instance, we go
                    and sulk. This contributes to bad feeling toward the U.S. and undermines the
                    ideals we espouse.</p>
                <p>In contrast, countries like Great Britain and Canada prepare their positions with
                    a lot of care. They consult with and groom their staff within multilateral
                    organizations. They take this work very seriously. They have meetings year round
                    and try to get agency coherence within their systems. We had annual bilateral
                    consultations with the Canadians on agricultural policy. Of course their foreign
                    policy process isn't fragmented among multiple agencies like ours. But their
                    attitude is what makes the difference. They're very professional about
                    approaching the UN, and they employ their top staff for the task. Because the
                    U.S. tends to devalue the UN, our delegations are often put together
                    haphazardly. We wanted to change that approach. It was gratifying to see what
                    could happen when cynicism was put aside.</p>
                <p>Jacques Diouf, an outside candidate, won the FAO Secretary General election. The
                    U.S. first backed the Australian candidate, but supported Diouf as our second
                    choice. He was the first African to head the FAO. His administration was more
                    collegial than Saouma's. Political issues like the Palestinian question or the
                    banana dispute between Central America and Spain, things that really couldn't be
                    resolved within that structure, lost much of their sheen. The technical work
                    improved in a few areas.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>We were able to channel an additional $1,200,000 into a technical conference on
                    plant biological diversity. We helped initiate a program to promote livestock
                    diversity and focus public attention on the destruction and eradication of
                    indigenous domestic speciecows, goats, sheep, draft horses, water buffaloes,
                    pigs and other livestock — that are appropriate to the climate and conditions of
                    distinct regions. The native species have disease and pest resistance, heat
                    tolerance, higher feed-conversion ratios, and other agricultural benefits that
                    need to be preserved. They are also beautiful in their unique qualities. But the
                    world's stock of animal genetic resources is highly threatened. As of the early
                    90s, the FAO estimated at least 30 percent of the 4000 existing breeds of farm
                    animals were endangered. The problem is intensifying. On the average one breed
                    per week is lost due to habitat losses, population pressures, natural disasters,
                    civil conflicts, and pressures from agro-business. The loss of plant diversity
                    is also hugsome estimates tell us that one type of crop is going extinct every
                    day.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know we have archives of seeds, and so we're not losing
                        the diversity of potatoes or something like that. I mean somewhere I hope
                        there are vaults and that sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: Not long ago there were literally thousands of varieties of potatoes. Many
                    have been lost. Now there's an effort to conserve those plant species in danger
                    of extinction. The Norwegians are setting up a massive seed vault in the Arctic
                    to serve as a backup to existing seed banks around the world. The freezing of
                    seeds is important, but community-based conservation is key, because farmers are
                    able to adjust crops to changing conditions. You don't want to lose farmers'
                    know how or their adaptations of those crops that have unique strengths. The
                    CGIAa network of agricultural research centeraddresses some of these issues with
                    support from the World Bank and USAID. They run CIP, the Centro International de
                    la Papa, in Peru. They preserve seeds and promote scientific investigation,
                    exploring the impact of different strains of plant diversity. At the time, their
                    programs were not well integrated with those of FAO. That shifted following
                    Saouma's departure. In 1994 the CIP reached an agreement with the FAO to team up
                    in germplasm collection.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's all well and good to try to preserve potato species
                        but what about Guernsey cows? I mean how do you save them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>ROE: The Guernsey cows produce high quality, relatively high-fat milk, but when
                    concerns emerged about cholesterol they went out of favor. Many breeds of
                    livestock deserve a second look, because diversity is an evolutionary good in
                    itself. You need alternatives to the model of factory agriculture that favors
                    genetic uniformity and unhealthy, unsustainable methods of raising crops and
                    livestock. There's no reason why farmers should be pushed to embrace the brand
                    of the week when the species they have been using have adapted well for
                    centuries. For example, some Andean countries were forcing peasants to kill off
                    their llama herds. Government officials were promoting harebrained schemes to
                    bring Holstein cows to the Andes — perhaps in the interests of seizing the land
                    for other purposes. Now there's growing respect for indigenous species like
                    llamas and alpacas. They make great wool, they're resilient, and they act
                    effectively as watchdogs for sheep and other domestic animals. If weaknesses
                    develop, scientists can cross-breed to strengthen the species. And likewise with
                    Brahmin cattle and the water buffaloes — they are terrific choices for the
                    Chapare in Bolivia and other semi-tropical region because they can haul, they're
                    make good milk or meat, and they are tremendously hardy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about what was the FAO doing? I mean
                        departing from a dictatorial system and an anti-American slant, how
                        effective did we see it becoming?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: FAO's goals in food security dovetail with U.S. objectives, but it had a
                    lackluster record in carrying them out. We wanted the agency to become better
                    focused, more transparent and responsive to the membership. We saw some signs of
                    progress. The FAO Conference and Council became more civilized, less long-winded
                    after the '93 election of Jacques Diouf. The G-77 leadership was becoming more
                    open to North-South cooperation and to solving some of the UN's many financial
                    problems. Much of the FAO bureaucracy was arthritic and costly. Some of the
                    organization's country offices were not doing much besides working up cozy
                    grants with the host governments. Other parts of the FAO held more promise.
                    These included statistics, integrated pest management, plant genetic resources,
                    the fisheries department, and to some extent food safety standards (the Codex
                    Alimentarius).</p>

                <p>A year into my assignment, I had an encounter with the Pope. The U.S. mission to
                    the UN food agencies (FODAG) is housed in the same building as the U.S. mission
                    to the Vatican. The Vatican is an important presence in Rome and within the FAO,
                    whose motto is “fiat panis,” (let there be bread.) Once a year the FAO has an
                    audience with the Pope. He presides at a special service for all the FAO
                    permanent representatives, their staff and families. By sheer luck I got a seat
                    right on the aisle. When Pope John Paul II arrived, he began shaking hands with
                    those on both sides of the aisle, asking their provenance. Because my husband is
                    Catholic and Chilean, I had his folks very much in mind. When he asked me, I
                    started to say Chile and quickly realized my mix-up. Pope John Paul II burst out
                    laughing and said, “Estados Unidos!” I thanked him for raising people's hopes in
                    Chile and helping them overcome a desperate standoff with Pinochet. He was happy
                    to hear that. But as the service was ending he took a terrible fall. The photo
                    of my handshake with his Holiness made a big hit with my Chilean in-laws.

                    see the death of someone who was the head of state, the head of the oldest
                    international organization. The Pope had an immense personal power. On April 3 I
                    played harp at Ireland's Four Courts, a restaurant in Clarendon, and I thought
                    people would be talking about this loss, but no. In the Washington area, people
                    are so bombarded with news they can get jaded. I watched the news clips showing
                    people turning out to mourn the Pope in Krakow, Poland, where he had presided
                    over a parish with no church, and fought ten years to get a place of worship; in
                    Chile where he carried out brilliant advocacy for democratic change; in the
                    Philippines where he spoke so sternly that Marcos stormed out of the meeting in
                    his own palace. John Paul II was open to plenty of criticism. His views on birth
                    control and abortion and the ordination of women became key criteria for
                    choosing bishops. Many feel this veered the U.S. church hierarchy away from the
                    social justice concerns of Vatican II. But he was a man of peace who spoke
                    powerfully for freedom and tolerance. He was the first of the popes to go into a
                    mosque, to visit Yad Vashem in Israel. He tried to reconcile ancient divisions
                    within the religious community. His record gave him credibility for speaking out
                    forcefully on Iraq and other issues of war and peace.</p>

                        see that impact or have to deal with it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: John Bolton was Assistant Secretary for International Organization from 1989
                    to January '93. He departed not long after my tour started. His influence was
                    then waning, but his footprints were notable. This is a man who sported a mock
                    grenade in his office, who as a top State Department official in a 1991 speech
                    said if the UN secretariat building in NYC lost ten stories, it wouldn't make a
                    bit of difference. I thought of that after 9/11. The debris we face today — the
                    mistrust and undermining of U.S. influence — is partly due to that kind of
                    legacy.</p>
                <p>In his second administration, President Reagan changed his approach to
                    disarmament issues making peace a major goal. By working so passionately on
                    those issues he shocked the hawks and ideologues, including Bolton, who
                    stridently attacked any international treaties that aim to restrict land mines,
                    biological weapons, nuclear testing or the trade in small arms. You can't work
                    these issues seriously while ignoring the UN system. There are those who saw
                    Saouma, for example, as an odd relic of the cold war era. To Bolton and Senator
                    Helms, he was Satan in person. That level of hatred occasionally surfaced in
                    pronouncements by the Congress. An exception was the Senate's Select Committee
                    on Hunger.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: Many. After changes in our policy approach, the relationship with
                    Agriculture improved so much that they would ask State to head the delegations
                    if USDA didn't have an assistant secretary to attend FAO meetings. But the
                    flames whipped up by the UN haters were still out there. Take the World Heritage
                    program run out of UNESCO. On occasion when UNESCO sent scientists to visit U.S.
                    sites of global importance, some paranoid organizations would mobilize local
                    sentiment around the idea that the UN is invading us or alighting to tell us how
                    to run our parks. The things we expect other countries to dopen their countries
                    to information and technical cooperatioare hard to reciprocate at home. Then we
                    wonder why our image is tarnished around the world.</p>

                        Who was our ambassador to the FAO and how did he or she work the

                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>ROE: The chief of mission for the U.S. food and agricultural mission in Rome was
                    William Marsh. Because of the U.S. hostility to the UN system and especially to
                    Saouma, we had downgraded the U.S. mission. The last Ambassador had been
                    Millicent Fenwick. She served from 1983 to '87. She'd been a Congressional
                    representative from New Jersey, a Republican, and was beloved by the FAO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: She was also turned into a comic book character in the
                        good sense by Garry Trudeau's comic strip Doonesbury.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: No kidding! Bill Marsh was an internationalist and a historian who had
                    worked mostly in the European region and in Vietnam. He was a raconteur and a
                    creative diplomat who relished inventing ways to get around Saouma. He was
                    committed to bridge the gulf between the U.S. and potential allies in the
                    developing world. During the second Clinton administration, the Mission was
                    upgraded when Senator George McGovern was appointed as Ambassador.</p>
                <p>The U.S. Embassy in Rome has traditionally been a large mission with poor morale.
                    Many Americans come to Rome expecting they're going to be living in style.
                    Instead they live in cramped apartments, find little shops with no malls, and
                    have to wade through streets jammed with all those pesky little motor scooters.
                    So they fall into two groups, those who adore Rome as it is and those who are
                    fish out of water. The FAO delegation, which included DAS Kimble and the USDA
                    staff, made a point of learning about each neighborhood within walking distance
                    of the FAO. We would stay in non-traditional places close to the Piazza della
                    Minerva, near the Pantheon.</p>
                <p>This seemingly impenetrable FAO bureaucracy was instead quite approachable. Like
                    any bureaucracy it was a diverse collection of parts. A major problem was that
                    many developing countries sent representatives to the FAO as a political plum
                    rather than for their expertise. Women were often shut out, especially in
                    Africa. But they were beginning to kick at the doors.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, women in Africa are central to agriculture.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: They surely are. I once heard former President Carter talk about his work in
                    Africa. He'd go to villages and ask the town leader or tribal chief about the
                    crops, whether they were rotating or improving them and how was production
                    going. He'd get almost no answers from the top man, so he'd ask well, who does
                    the work? The women, he was told. He'd ask to meet with the women. Then he got
                    the answers. This year's Nobel prize went to Wangari Maathai of Kenya. She is a
                    real force for change. In setting out to plant a million trees she had to fight
                    a corrupt dictatorship which had her beaten and jailed several times. She
                    persisted and organized women, and became a leading environment official and a
                    model worldwide for women and young people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went to the FAO in Rome, did you have to open up
                        channels with other members? Were Americans kind of shut out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: Americans weren't so much shut out as they were facing the results of
                    self-isolation. U.S. delegates already had a close affiliation with those from
                    the Commonwealth countries like Canada, Great Britain and Australia, as well as
                    with West Europeans who shared our views about fiscal discipline. During my
                    assignment, our delegation made a point of reaching out beyond this comfort
                    zone. I developed ties with other perm reps from Latin America and from the
                    newly liberated countries of Central, Eastern and Southeastern Europe. One of my
                    closest colleagues, Elena Askerstam, was the Permanent Representative from
                    Estonia. She had seniority within the regional group and had previously worked
                    for the FAO.</p>
                <p>After the floor debates, the real work began. We'd take turns covering the
                    committee that produces the written record of the debates and the decisions
                    taken. Things were so polarized in the FAO that for years those committees had
                    been all night sessions in which every word was disputed. Neither side wanted to
                    let go of the bone.</p>
                <p>Some of our predecessors had reveled in the martyrdom of getting no sleep or time
                    to break bread with other delegates. (In one FSI training session on
                    multilateral diplomacy, former IO/AG Director Gayoso ridiculed the Europeans for
                    wanting to visit cultural venues in Rome on weekends, instead of slugging it out
                    in these dark rooms. I asked, “That's how you get to know them, isn't it?”) Our
                    EU counterparts and most other country reps like to do business over lunch or a
                    cup of cappuccino. You can't be a sourpuss or fight cultural wars with any hope
                    of success in Rome.</p>
                <p>In the past the report committee assignment was a punishing assignment. We found
                    instead that it could be an interesting way to build coalitions. If you
                    understand the language issues and don't have to rely on the headsets and the
                    official translations, you're a step ahead. With a bit of humor and common
                    sense, you attract win new allies. We even got support from a few Arab-speaking
                    countries that were normally on Saouma's side, because they saw us resolving
                    small issues to advance the organization's mission. Eventually those sessions
                    became shorter and more productive.</p>

                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>ROE: The U.S. and other reform-minded delegations pushed hard to have sensitive
                    budget issues be decided by consensus and not by majority vote, and this is now
                    the rule instead of the exception. During this period, the FAO held technical
                    consultations for a Code of Conduct for Responsible Fishing, another U.S. aim.
                    These talks eventually led to an agreement on fishing and coastal management
                    practices aimed at halting the depletion of global fish stocks. Enforcing that
                    agreement is still a huge challenge that depends on the member countries. A key
                    U.S. objective was for the FAO to launch a center for domestic livestock
                    diversity. We were only partially successful, but the FAO did develop a
                    respected database on domestic animal diversity and helped raise global
                    awareness of the impact of biodiversity loss in the livestock and plant
                    sectors.</p>
                <p>The FAO works to counteract the locust plague that cyclically hits sub-Saharan
                    Africa. U.S. pest control experts with USAID collaborate with the FAO in these
                    efforts. I helped uncork a fiscal bottleneck on the USAID side in 1992, when
                    desert locusts reappeared on the coastal plains around the Red Sea. We also
                    pushed to close country offices that could no longer be justified, freeing more
                    resources for good programs like integrated pest management (IPM) for rice
                    production in Asia. FAO experts trained hundreds of thousands of farmers for IPM
                    in field schools. NGOs as well as the newly independent states and Eastern
                    European countries were interested in these models.</p>

                        there is this battle that continues to rage between our crop subsidies and
                        the common agricultural policy of the EU, which is mainly German and French.
                        Did that figure in your work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>ROE: It was a big sub-text. Some European representatives, especially the French,
                    were lofty in speaking about their commitment to sustainable development. But
                    their agriculture subsidies support intensive pesticide and fertilizer
                    applications. The U.S. collaborated closely with the Cairns group, led by
                    Australia, which promoted free trade in agriculture. At that point, we could do
                    so with a straight face. Some years later, the Bush administratiofor the first
                    time in decadelet the agricultural industry lobby get its way in Congresand our
                    position became less tenable. U.S. trade officials once tried to justify those
                    atrociously large subsidies by saying we just put them out there as a
                    negotiating chip to try to leverage an agreement with the Europeans on ending
                    all subsidies. Well, it hasn't worked out that way. At least during my tenure,
                    when we had a Presidential initiative to implement the sustainable development
                    agenda, the U.S. administration was making strong efforts to incorporate
                    environmental initiatives within the omnibus farm bill. Under Bush II, many of
                    those initiatives shrunk, while farm subsidies to crops like rice, sugar beet
                    and sugar cane have swollen.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: Surprisingly little of that on the U.S. side. Our delegations were pretty
                    much all work horses. We would get either State's or Agriculture's assistant
                    secretary to head the delegation. They would leave after a few days and the DAS
                    would remain for most of the session, writing resolutions and speeches with us
                    on the weekends. If we could get a couple of congressional representatives to
                    come, we appreciated their presence as it gave us a chance to exchange ideas
                    about the FAO. Several of the delegates were research directors within
                    Agriculture; some were scientists coming from their research stations. AID would
                    send a few experts, usually those working with the agriculture research centers.
                    A good deal of intellectual ferment was generated within the sessions.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: Not really. They paid lip service to agriculture during talks on the
                    Presidential Directive on Sustainable Development (known as PRD-12), because
                    agriculture was central to Agenda 21. At headquarters we worked year round in
                    multi-agency task forces on PRD-12. Our unit prepared a major analysis on the
                    FAO and the other food-related UN agencies. AID devoted less and less attention
                    and resources to these issues. When I arrived in IO, Andrew Natsios headed AID's
                    humanitarian assistance unit. After becoming AID Director, Natsios distilled the
                    agency's objectives into four “pillars” that included democracy and economic
                    growth but not agriculture. Agriculture had to find its way within each one of

                <p>ROE: The assistant secretary when I first went there was Elinor Constable. She
                    was succeeded by Eileen Claussen in 1995. OES is a multifaceted bureau. One big
                    slice is scientific cooperation, which can involve monitoring issues such as
                    water management in politically charged areas or, on a more regular basis,
                    negotiating and managing bi-national agreements. The oceans division is involved
                    with the Law of the Sea and fisheries, the agreements that encompass the Arctic
                    and Antarctic and involve Alaska, Russia, the Inuit and other indigenous tribes
                    and the protection of those vital oceans. Another section focuses on climate
                    change and the Kyoto treaty. My area included environmental cooperation and
                    conservation, the interface of trade and environment, biodiversity protection
                    and endangered species.</p>

                <p>ROE: My first office was ETC, Ecology and Terrestrial Conservation. I was liaison
                    with Treasury, the World Bank and other international financial institutions. I
                    was the point person for implementation of NEPA, the National Environmental
                    Policy Act first enacted under President Nixon. NEPA became an early template
                    for environmental protection policy and was adapted in various forms by other
                    countries throughout the world. NEPA stipulates that before undertaking any
                    development project affecting interstate commerci.e. most major transportation
                    or construction projects, public works, dams, power plantthe project sponsors
                    must assess its environmental impact and engage in dialogue with a wide range of
                    community stake-holders to ensure there are no serious adverse effects and that
                    those identified are remedied. Internationally, this study is called an
                    environmental impact assessment (EIA); in the U.S., it's termed an EIS or
                    environmental impact study; if it connects multiple projects over time, it's a
                    PEIS (programmatic environmental impact study). An EIS also addresses the
                    related issues of economic and social impacts, historical preservation, and
                    Native American artifacts and the like.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is the State Department doing with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: Seems odd, doesn't it? In the early 1970s, Congress granted State the
                    authority to issue permits for bridges, pipelines and river crossings on the
                    border with Mexico and Canada. At that time 22 bridges crossed the 1200-mile
                    international boundary formed by the Rio Grande River between El Paso and the
                    Gulf of Mexico. State had previously permitted ten bridges under the guidelines
                    outlined in Executive Order 11423, but had only conducted cursory reviews called
                    environmental assessments (EAs). For some time the Audubon society, the EPA, the
                    Fish and Wildlife Bureau and various NGOs had called on the Department to
                    conduct a PEIS. An EA looks at one project at a time. It's a quick and narrow
                    focus. Unlike an EIS or a PEIS, it doesn't involve having public hearings or
                    give and take with local communities. Now, the State Department had never done a
                    serious impact study, much less a PEIS that looks at cumulative impacts over
                    time. The environmental side accord of NAFTA generated more interest </p>

                    regional environmental concerns and better enforce existing environmental laws.
                    After considerable discussion within the Department and sister agencies, OES/ETC
                    and the Mexico desk thought it was time to go beyond a piecemeal approach to
                    assess the whole range of bridges that had been, or would potentially be,
                    permitted by State—</p>

                <p>ROE: That's right. The structures also included a ferry crossing into Mexico, a
                    dam and one railroad crossing. One focus of public concern is that the lower Rio
                    Grande — where most of the bridges are located — is one of the richest, most
                    biologically diverse ecosystems in the Western hemisphere. Bird-watchers,
                    naturalists and those living in South Texas are aware of this treasure, but many
                    others are not. This river habitat is home to the endangered jaguarundi and the
                    ocelot.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The jaguarundi being a type of swine?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: That would be the javelina, a small wild boar that dines on prickly pear
                    cactus. Some live in the Southwestern U.S. The jaguarundi is a mid-sized,
                    plain-colored wild feline found in Central and South America, primarily in dense
                    forest or shrub habitat. Some of these solitary cats roam in South Texas, New
                    Mexico and Florida. The ocelot is a spotted feline, another cousin of the
                    jaguar, that is also very elusive and endangered. Like the Texas tortoise, the
                    Green Jay, Green Kingfisher, Aplomado Falcon and hundreds of migratory birds,
                    the ocelot and jaguarundi need the native thornbrush that grows alongside the
                    lower Rio Grande for safe cover and nourishment. In recent years bird-watching
                    has spurred economic growth around Harlingen. Around fourteen million
                    bird-watchers visit each year to observe the amazing birdlife. The Fish and
                    Wildlife Service and Texas parks people have been working with private
                    landowners and groups with the goal of connecting up the fragmented parts of
                    this dense wildlife corridor. That habitat would be harmed by major construction
                    projects, unless builders took steps to ensure continuous brush coverage and
                    make passageways for wildlife.</p>
                <p>To follow up, I co-drafted with the OES legal staff a proposal for a
                    comprehensive environmental assessment on bridge crossings on the Rio Grande
                    border with Mexico. We took the proposal through the inter-agency process with
                    strong backing from OES. The Assistant Secretary was initially skeptical, but
                    realized the need for State to demonstrate due diligence in enforcing the law.
                    The proposal dovetailed with efforts by the Interior Department's biodiversity
                    team to develop a digitalized map of the Texas-Mexico border adjoining the Rio
                    Grande river basin.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>Seven agencies, including EPA, the Department of Interior, Department of
                    Transportation, Immigration and Naturalization Service and the U.S. Coast Guard,
                    funded the programmatic environmental impact study (PEIS). To implement the
                    study, we reached out to the Ft. Worth Army Corps of Engineers (ACE). This is a
                    “green” arm of the ACthe local staff is made up largely of ecologists,
                    biologists, and sociologists. Eric Verwers of ACE was project manager. He
                    contracted Geo-Marine, an environmental consulting firm, to conduct the PEIS. In
                    cooperation with Eric Verwers, Chris Ingram of Geo-Marine, and L/OES, we drafted
                    the guidelines and filed a federal register notice. After placing the public
                    notice, OES/ETC Office Director Robert Pringle suddenly said, “We can't go ahead
                    now unless we have a letter of approval from the state of Texas.” As things
                    stood, Governor Bush's staff, including Secretary of State Tony Garza (now
                    serving as Ambassador to Mexico), were well aware of State's responsibilities
                    for permitting bridges. Steve Gibson, WHA's Coordinator for Mexican border
                    affairs, had informed Garza's office about the proposed PEIS. But the Department
                    could hardly request approval from the state of Texas when State's bridge
                    permitting authority had been directly granted by Congress.</p>
                <p>So we had a problem. Against all reason, Pringle started insisting that the state
                    of Texas approve the study in writing. EPA, the Fish and Wildlife Service, the
                    Coast Guard, General Services Administration, the Federal Highway
                    Administration, the Mexico desk and other agency co-sponsors found that
                    unacceptable. To meet some of Pringle's concerns, we wrote Governor Bush a
                    letter outlining our plans. As we expected, there was no adverse reaction.</p>
                <p>In late winter and spring of 1995, we held public hearings along Rio Grande towns
                    and cities. Mexico desk officer Steve Gibson and I took turns chairing the
                    public hearings and consultations with Texas agencies. Nature conservation
                    groups, public interest groups and the head of the Texas Bridge Owners'
                    Association welcomed the effort. Both sides made it clear they trusted State to
                    be an honest broker. There was low-decimal grumbling in one meeting by a staff
                    member of the Texas Conservation Commission concerning turf issues they had with
                    Fish and Wildlife. The public feedback and news reports on our activities were
                    uniformly positive. We demonstrated the Department's commitment to ecological
                    cooperation on the border, a place where foreign policy directly affects
                    people's lives.</p>
                <p>Despite these results, there was a downside for me. Because of the intra-office
                    dispute, Pringle and Peter Kaestner, the ETC deputy, wrote a very unfavorable
                    rating and review (EER) of my performance in 1995. The EER was so unfounded that
                    the Department later voided it through an expedited grievance process.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where do you feel Pringle was coming from? Was he afraid
                        of adverse reaction in Texas?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>ROE: Yes. He was extremely nervous about the prospect of agitating the political
                    waters. George W. Bush was elected governor of Texas in 1994. Pringle referred
                    to Gov. Bush as “the enemy” because of his conservative Republican leanings. He
                    thought right-wing groups would whip up hysteria in Texas or that an article
                    might appear in the Houston press saying the State Department was “invading”
                    Texas. That crazy nuts ran the Lone Star state was the Washington patrician's
                    view, with no basis in fact. I worked in South Texas during the 1960s and 70s. I
                    knew something about the terrain. I didn't think Washingtonians had a patent on
                    sanity, or that Texans were locos. The Mexico desk was even better acquainted
                    with Texas politics. Steve Gibson knew we were on solid ground. Tyrus Fain, the
                    Assistant Land Commissioner for Texas and a former colleague from the Yarborough
                    campaign, supported this project, as did local and state environmental NGOs and
                    wildlife officials. Not one local, not even Congressman Tom Delay's brother (who
                    attended one of our hearings), was spooked about “black helicopters” arriving
                    from Washington.</p>
                <p>Another problem was managerial. Pringle had given the go-ahead on the PEIS
                    without thinking it through. Before filing the Federal Register notice, I sent
                    Pringle and A/S Constable a message asking them “are you sure we should go
                    ahead?” They answered yes, full speed. For standing my ground on a program he
                    had approved, Pringle viewed me as insubordinate. ETC Deputy Director Kaestner,
                    who did Pringle's bidding, was wrapped up in his own personal ambitions and
                    hobbies. His EER and Pringle's review statement got the facts wrong. It
                    basically said I was an uppity broad, in terms not much more subtle than that.
                    Larry Cohen, who had the NAFTA portfolio in the neighboring OES office,
                    witnessed some of Pringle's unprofessional conduct, including his shouting fits;
                    he wrote a strong statement backing my position. Steve Gibson, Joe Montgomery of
                    EPA and key officers at other agencies testified in writing that I'd represented
                    State's interests effectively while negotiated with numerous federal and state
                    actors.</p>
                <p>Rafe Pomerance, the Deputy Assistant Secretary, took immediate action on my
                    behalf after Pringle and Kaestner wrote the flawed review. In June 1995, Rafe
                    moved my whole portfolio to the adjoining office, ENV (the Office of
                    Environmental Policy). In less than six months, the grievance board threw out
                    the blackballing EER.</p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>In ENV I continued work on the PEIS and on environmental issues related to the
                    World Bank and Inter-American Development Bank. I was also involved in
                    preliminary negotiations with Canada and Mexico concerning NAFTA implementation.
                    Article 10.7 of the North American Free Trade Agreement's side accord requires
                    the signatories to develop environmental assessment guidelines for proposed
                    government projects that are “likely to cause significant adverse transboundary
                    impacts.” Trilateral talks began in Canada in August '95 under the auspices of
                    the Council on Environmental Cooperation (CEC), a small organization created by
                    the NAFTA side accords that is headquartered in Montreal and funded equally by
                    the U.S., Canada and Mexico. The CEC was at that time headed by Greg Block, a
                    U.S. environmental attorney. With the White House's Council on Environmental
                    Quality (CEQ) initially in the lead, we formed a 22-agency international working
                    group to hammer out U.S. policy. Sandra Levinson of L/OES headed the TEIA
                    (transboundary environmental impact assessment) negotiating team. State, CEQ,
                    EPA, Justice and Interior made up the task force. Our delegation included
                    advisory representatives from the Western Governors' Association and from the
                    Tohono O'odham, a large Southwestern tribe that spans the border with
                    Mexico.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did these people work together? Were they all pretty
                        much in the same chorus or did you have problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: There was a lot of push and pull, but the U.S. delegation worked well as a
                    team. The U.S. and Canada made it clear from the start that any agreement would
                    apply only to projects under federal jurisdiction and that the TEIA could not
                    cover projects under the exclusive authority of state and local governments. In
                    the beginning Mexico seemed prepared to accept these limitations. Canada has
                    plenty of thorny issues with the U.S. over acid rain, water pollution, fisheries
                    and the like, but in this arena their position was much closer to ours than to
                    Mexico's. As the negotiations progressed, divisions within the federal
                    government of Mexico surfaced and they rejected the compromise text that
                    “respected the integrity of subnational processes.” By 1997, the negotiations
                    came to an impasse.</p>

                <p>ROE: Well, yes — Pringle was no longer over me. I transferred to ENV (Office of
                    Environmental Policy), which adjoined ETC. The ENV director was Day Mount. The
                    deputy was Bob Ford, an experienced and respected civil service officer. Day,
                    Bob, Larry Cohen and the other ENV officers had good insights on the issues I
                    covered. These included working with Treasury on debt-for-nature agreements with
                    other South American countries. I worked closely with the Economic Bureau's
                    Office of Development Finance (EB/ODF). Together with Steve Liston of ODF, we
                    monitored what the World Bank and regional development banks were doing to
                    incorporate environmental guidelines into its lending activities. I met
                    regularly with a large consortium of NGOs called the Tuesday Group. The National
                    Resources Defense Council and other NGOs frequently had good leads about how
                    Bank project were developing on the ground. As an example, we worked with Bank
                    staff to recast key elements of a $39 million agricultural loan for Venezuela
                    and form a working group to promote sustainable food security and natural
                    resource protection in the agricultural sector, the Bank's largest
                    portfolio.</p>
                <p>Another focus was the Pangue dam, a project of the International Finance
                    Corporation (IFC), the investment arm of the World Bank. Pangue was approved in
                    1993 despite U.S. resistance. This 450-megawatt hydroelectric project was the
                    first step in a series of dams planned by the Spanish corporation Endesa on the
                    upper Bio-Bio River in south-central Chile. In January 1995 my sister Becky from
                    Colorado joined me in a quickly-organized trip up the Bio-Bio to see the Pangue
                    and find out about how it was affecting the ecosystem, downstream users and
                    especially the Pehuenche, an indigenous community whose only homeland was this
                    gorgeous mountainous watershed. We traveled by truck up the mountain with the
                    Grupo de Accion por el Bio-Bio and met with Berta and Nicolas Quintreman and
                    other Pehuenche community leaders in the upper Bio-Bio. They were up in arms
                    about the plans for their forced removal and continued fighting for years to
                    come. We saw clear evidence that the series of dams would threaten the temperate
                    rainforest habitat, which according to recent Bank studies was one of the most
                    biodiverse and fragile in South America.</p>
                <p>On my return I raised major questions about the project's impact in a memo to the
                    World Bank, and we had heated exchanges with the IFC. We were joined by other
                    Bank officers and environmental organizations, responding to a long-standing
                    complaint raised by Chilean NGOs. This push led WB President Wolfensohn to
                    commission an independent review of the Pangue loan to see whether the project
                    complied with WB policies and whether any of IFC's legal guidelines had been
                    violated. That report, completed in 1997, confirmed our concerns that the
                    project had been initiated without credible studies or public input and would do
                    real ecological and socio-economic damage. The next dam in the series, called
                    Ralco, is now being built without World Bank financing. Experiences like this
                    have made WB officials stay clear of large dam proposals.</p>

                    is provided by international financial institutions. The World Bank, the IFC,
                    and the Inter-American Development Bank set the tone for donor countries'
                    development programs.</p>

                <p>ROE: Yes. OES had decided to create environmental “hubs,” officers who are based
                    in an Embassy but work on a regional basis to catalyze more assistance and
                    promote U.S. positions with respect to climate change negotiations and other
                    global issues. OES had asked if I wanted one of the regional hub positions. As I
                    understood the job, the “hub” would be like a glorified cheerleader for U.S.
                    policies and programs for Central and Eastern Europe (C/EE). I couldn't see the
                    point at a time when the U.S. was seriously cutting back on funding for the C/EE
                    region. I bid instead on a position in Budapest, Hungary. I was always felt a
                    kinship with Hungarians, their struggle and that of their neighbors for freedom.
                    The environmental movement was the cutting edge of the democratic revolution in
                    Hungary. I was selected to be environmental/science attach� in Budapest — one of
                    the few times I won my top choice for an onward assignment — and began nine

                    Czech new wave of the 60s and 70s. At his request, I organized a session on the
                    intersection of political and environmental issues. In the spring of 1996 I took
                    part in a two-week language immersion tour to Budapest, Debrecen and Eger that
                    was organized by FSI's Hungarian staff. Taken together, these courses were more
                    thorough preparation than I'd had for any Foreign Service assignment.</p>

                <p>Leaving Washington was hard for me because in the spring of 1997, Hector told me
                    he couldn't accompany me as planned in Budapest. When we moved to Washington, he
                    started his own business handling air container traffic as a contractor with
                    Airborne Express. He didn't want to lose his vesting in Social Security and what
                    he'd built up over our time in the U.S. I understood, but felt especially sad
                    about leaving our two dogs. The decision to stay was Hector's, but the dogs had
                    no say at all. Two weeks before I departed for Budapest, my mother and
                    stepfather, then close to their 87th birthdays, drove down from upstate New York
                    for an impromptu stay. We paid a visit to Grandfather Lester Roger's grave at
                    Arlington National Cemetery and had an idyllic weekend. In the next few years, I
                    saw Eloise many times during my home stays. But the August visit was one of the

                <p>ROE: I went to Budapest as Environmental and Science Attach�. One of my
                    responsibilities was to be Commissioner for the U.S.-Hungary Science and
                    Technology Joint Fund, a small but impressive organization founded by the
                    governments of Hungary and the U.S. In 1989 President H.W. Bush made an historic
                    speech in Budapest and signed an inter-agency agreement to spur scientific
                    exchanges and cooperative research in Central and Eastern Europe. Over the next
                    decade, the S&amp;T Joint Fund supported hundreds of scientific projects, all
                    subject to peer review, engaging thousands of scientists from the U.S. and
                    Hungary. The Fund developed close ties with OES, the National Science
                    Foundation. Within the country it cooperated with the Foreign Ministry, the
                    Hungarian Academy of Sciences and the Ministries of Environment, Agriculture and
                    Health.</p>
                <p>In the same speech the President committed the U.S. to work with the European
                    Union to help clean up Soviet-era contamination in these countries. That was the
                    genesis of the Regional Environmental Center (REC), an independent organization
                    that builds cooperation among governments, businesses and NGOs to address the
                    most pressing environmental problems in the region. I was U.S. liaison for the
                    REC, which is headquartered in Szentendre, a medieval town a half an hour from
                    Budapest. By the mid-1990s, core U.S. funding was ending, but EPA still kept a
                    visible presence in the REC's governance and supported specific projects. The
                    REC was branching out to the Balkans, Eastern Europe and the Baltic states</p>

                        was dominated by Hungary's desire to get into the European Union because the
                        EU has taken such a strong stand on various environmental issues.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: The dialogue was framed by EU accession. That involved a complex series of
                    steps to adapt Hungary's laws and institutions to Brussels' policies for
                    environmental protection. This had a price: the EU accession process focused
                    largely on the legal and bureaucratic adjudication process. On the books,
                    Hungary's environmental laws were quite advanced. But implementation was spotty,
                    and the accession process tended to draw scarce energies and resources further
                    away from the enforcement of existing laws. The REC aimed to open up avenues for
                    broad-based public participation. These were modeled not on EU bureaucratic
                    procedures but on the experience of the U.S. and emerging countries. The REC
                    became a catalyst for bringing citizens into the environmental boardroom.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: That's Germany. But in Hungary, the environmentalists have deeper, broader
                    roots. Theirs was the most vocal movement challenging the Soviet-supported
                    regime in the 1970s and 80s. After the Soviets crushed the Hungarian revolution
                    of 1956, the incipient environmental movement was one place that people could
                    more easily get away with expressing their disagreement with the authorities.
                    The movement coalesced when the Duna K�r (Danube Circle) formed in 1984 under
                    the leadership of J�nos Vargha to fight the Gabcikovo dam project. Ironically,
                    when I arrived in Budapest in 1977, the Embassy and the intelligence community
                    were convinced the Greens were marginal, insignificant, and that Horn's dam
                    project was inevitable. I had a different take, and advised Washington this
                    issue would be a dynamite keg for the Horn regime.</p>

                <p>ROE: Yes, in 1992 Czechoslovakia completed construction of Gabcikovo, a
                    hydroelectric project in the upper part of the middle Danube. The project was
                    designed by Soviet-trained engineers under a 1977 agreement with Hungary. (In
                    his dissident days, Czech Prime Minister Vaclav Havel decried Gabcikovo as an
                    example of “Stalinist megalomania.”) In the 1980s, during the waning years of
                    the Soviet empire, Hungary began construction of Nagymaros, the twin project, in
                    a sensitive area of the Danube bend just 30 miles from Budapest. A massive
                    popular movement arose in opposition to the dam, which to Hungarians symbolized
                    arrogance of one-party rule. The anti-government protests forced the government
                    to suspend construction and hastened the collapse of the iron curtain.</p>
                <p>The case went to the International Court of Justice (ICJ). In 1997 the ICJ ruled
                    that Hungary was wrong to have terminated its part of project under the 1997
                    treaty, but also that Slovakia had no right to build Gabcikovo unilaterally. In
                    other words, a draw.</p>
                <p>Hungarian Prime Minister Gyula Horn, who was elected in 1994, had promoted the
                    dam as a Communist official when Hungary was under Soviet rule. Now he used the
                    ambiguous ICJ ruling to revive the hydroelectric project. Once again the Danube
                    affair raised passions to a boiling point. The protest built up steam, and by
                    early 1998 massive demonstrations against the Nagymaros dam involved broad
                    constituencies — the Hungarian Democratic Forum, apolitical associations like
                    the Esperanto Club, and conservative groups like the Association of Hungarian
                    Families. The movement was fired by the eco-warriors of the Duna K�r. But it was
                    populated by ordinary Magyars: housewives, artists, students, architects and
                    technicians.</p>

                    a long channel to generate 720 megawatts of electricity. Nagymaros, the

                <p>ROE: The negative impacts and environmental risks included destroying the habitat
                    of dozens of birds and aquatic species, polluting the drinking water, and
                    lowering hydrostatic pressure for the treasured thermal springs around Budapest.
                    The area most threatened was Szigetk�z, the marshes, hardwood groves and wet
                    meadows along the floodplain of the Danube. This wetlands area harbors many
                    endangered species and works as a hydrological discharge for the whole
                    northeastern region of Hungary. People were also responding to deep-going
                    cultural and national identity issues. The Danube gave birth to a broad
                    turn-of-the-century artistic and philosophical movement that was expressed in
                    one of Europe's richest, most unique art nouveau architecture and design. The
                    movement sought to reclaim Hungary's indigenous origins, re-ignite its cultural
                    and linguistic ties with the East, and humanize industrial development. The
                    motivation for the dam directly conflicted with this consciousness. The project
                    would submerge a number of small islands including Helemba, which contains
                    invaluable Celtic and Arpad ruins. Indirectly, it was a terrible reminder of the
                    1920 Treaty of Trianon that severed Hungary from two-thirds of its national
                    territory and the majority of its population. The Magyars have been scorched too
                    many times in their troubled history; they are understandably protective of the
                    land and rivers they have left.</p>

                    through. The opposition was overwhelming. Horn's party was defeated in the April
                    1998 parliamentary elections by Victor Orban, a conservative. Orban named J�nos
                    Vargha, one of my close contacts, as his environmental advisor. During the 1970s
                    Vargha received the Goldman Environmental Prize for his work with the Duna K�r.

                    was essential for the great bulk of communications with our counterparts in
                    Hungary. (The only other unclassified pc available for internet traffic was
                    located two stories below.) Andrew Bock, a full-time Dante Fascell fellow, was
                    environmental officer. He was well-versed in the science community, spoke fluent
                    Hungarian, and helped enormously during my first year. I was catapulted into
                    negotiations on the climate change treaty. I worked with the REC and served as
                    Commissioner of the U.S.-Hungary Science and Technology Fund. We were assisting
                    the University of Rochester in a series of conferences on environmental
                    technologies, promoting U.S.-based environmental firms, and following a range of
                    other issues from biodiversity protection to public health to nuclear
                    safety.</p>
                <p>On all fronts, Hungary was reforming its institutions and developing new ways to
                    meet EU standards. The REC for example was implementing the Sofia Biodiversity
                    Initiative in an effort to ensure that economic transition would enhance, not
                    harm, biological and cultural diversity. Ambassador Tufo was looking for ways to
                    mobilize U.S. financial resources to assist in Hungary's campaign to develop its
                    poorer regions to the East.</p>
                <p>The Balkans war raised tensions throughout the region. Tasz�r, the U.S. Army base
                    in southern Hungary, played a strategic role in the conflict leading up to the
                    1999 Kosovo air-strikes. Hungary provided strong support for the U.S. effort in
                    Kosovo, but was concerned about risks to millions of ethnic Hungarians living in
                    bordering countries.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Tufo of Hungarian descent?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: No. He billed himself as a “friend of Al Gore” — a former staff aide to
                    Senator Gaylord Nelson and later an investment attorney in New York City. Tufo
                    was keenly interested in the environment. But when it became clear there was
                    little USG money to spend in this area, his ardor cooled. He was on permanent
                    overdrive, and his personal affairs would often intertwine with government
                    business. For example, an environmental attorney friend of Tufo's who wanted a
                    job in Central Europe inundated our section and the front office with hundreds
                    of faxes pressing his case. Finally, I spoke with the administrative counselor
                    who agreed there was potentially a big conflict of interest. When I conveyed
                    this to the attorney, he understood at once. Other officers had urged me to walk
                    on eggshells out of fear of incurring Tufo's wrath.</p>

                        affect on our relations with Hungary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: Hungarians are sharp observers with a good sense of humor. The Ambassador
                    was divorcing wife number two when he arrived in Hungary. He married an actress,
                    then that ended. He later married the daughter of a Nepali businessman. At some
                    point after my departure, he reportedly looped in his third or fourth wedding
                    reception with an official USG celebration in historic St. Matthias Cathedral on
                    Castle Hill in Buda. Society-watchers may have enjoyed these operettas, but they
                    were tough on Embassy staff. Ambassador Tufo often cancelled meetings on a
                    moment's notice. He was mercurial and a dedicated self-promoter.</p>
                <p>On the plus side, Tufo was an astute public communicator. He understood U.S.
                    politics and social history. He gave several presentations to Roma groups about
                    our civil rights experience, talking from the heart about how Afro-Americans
                    fought successfully to overcome centuries of degrading, inhuman treatment. He
                    paid close attention to economic and law enforcement issues. A key focus was the
                    International Law Enforcement Academy, which the FBI founded in Budapest in
                    1995.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Roma? You've got a two-part problem. One is
                        the centuries-old xenophobia about those we call gypsies. I was in
                        Yugoslavia for five years and saw the same thing. At the same time behind
                        this prejudice were other concerns, like the question of settlement and the
                        splintered leadership in the Roma community. How were Hungarians addressing
                        these issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>ROE: Historically, any government efforts to forcibly settle the Rominstead of
                    letting them develop their own culturhave been disastrous. Treatment of the Roma
                    and of minority Hungarians in neighboring countries related directly to EU
                    accession. Hungary had close to 500,000 Roma out of a population of 10.2
                    million. The Roma make up the largest minority. Most were living in substandard
                    conditions, with at least seventy-five percent below the poverty line. Hungary
                    and neighboring countries had traditionally sent Roma children to “special”
                    schools, which were run as though they were schools for the retarded. This was a
                    virulent kind of educational apartheid. Less than ten percent of Roma youth
                    graduated from high school. Those that finished college you could count on your
                    hands. The Communists had promoted a disastrous policy of assimilation. (In some
                    ways this mirrored the U.S. practices from the 1950s to the mid '70s, when our
                    government tried to close down Indian reservations.) Uprooting the Roma to urban
                    areas was aimed to encourage integration. But suppressing their ethnic identity
                    only led to alienation, despair, alcoholism and greater unemployment.</p>
                <p>Starting in the early 1990s, Hungary changed its tack and experimented with a
                    modest self-government system focused on education and culture, with mixed
                    results. The Roma had a desk in the Education Ministry. Reformers tried to
                    implement housing solutions and to develop legislation for expanded civil rights
                    and cultural diversity. Still, local government officials have been resistant to
                    change. Divisions in the Roma community and high post-transition unemployment
                    and crime rates made the situation worse. Police brutality remained an uppermost
                    concern of the Roma. In one case a local Roma leader took part in a radio
                    program discussing police problems. In retaliation, the town police assaulted
                    him and his brothers and beat them severely.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: When I worked in Rome, I heard similar admonitiondon't walk alone near the
                    monuments or “they” will surround you. In Budapest, a metro official once warned
                    me that the Roma were v�szeyes (dangerous) because they would spread germs and
                    take your money. This is the fear reaction. People who are insecure apply it to
                    any group that differs from them. During my language immersion, I went to a Roma
                    dance hall frequented by teens and young adults. We FSI students were the only
                    non-Roma at the event. The Roma were polite and very shy.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>One weekend in October 1998 I drove to Romania with Mary McKinley, then a
                    lecturer at Catholic University and Corvinus in Budapest; Claudia Spahl, a
                    political officer at the German Embassy; and two anthropology post-grad
                    students, one of whom was Roma. We toured the huge Roma fair called Vasarfeket�
                    (Black River Market) in N�greni, Romania. It's like a giant county fair, teaming
                    with caravans of traders, horse carts, musicians, livestock, stray dogs,
                    colorful scraps of everything a home might need. We stayed over in Cluj, the
                    formerly Hungarian city in Transylvania. That was a fascinating glimpse of the
                    west of Hungary that was chopped into pieces following World War I. As for
                    N�greni, despite its rough exterior, the flea market turned out to be about as
                    safe as a street fair in Georgetown. There's a sense of protection you don't
                    find in a rootless, anonymous urban setting. The gypsies were the smiths of
                    Europe in centuries gone by and they held a more respected economic position
                    then, even though religious authorities had persecuted them for centuries.</p>

                <p>ROE: They were the metal and iron workers, craftsmen, scissors-makers and
                    repairers of all kinds of household goods, and there was good income in that.
                    Modern manufacturing obliterated these professions. Hungary went through
                    difficult economic times in the first years of the transition to democracy with
                    the closing of the state-run industries. It was hardest for women workers and
                    other marginalized groups like the Roma. Now, Roma artists are making films that
                    help you understand their situation and aspirations. A must-read on traveling
                    gypsy traditions is a recent book, Zoli, by Colum McCann. Zoli is a poet and
                    singer whose character is based on the life of Papusza, who fled fascism to join
                    a clan of Roma harpists. Isabel Fonseca, a London-based journalist, lived with
                    Roma families in Romania and other C/EE countries and wrote a gripping portrait
                    of the Roma and their journey called Bury Me Standing. The public spaces around
                    Roma homes seem to be disheveled, even trashy at times. Inside, the homes are
                    immaculate. Traditionally the Roma take a lot of pride in their way of life.
                    They have big clans. If they trust you, you're in good company.</p>
                <p>They face horrendous discrimination. The Nazis systematically exterminated
                    gypsies, beginning with the pretext of crime prevention in Russia, Poland and
                    the Balkans. Now the same attitude is revived in the skinhead crimes that have
                    taken place in Russia, Eastern Europe, Germany and neighboring countries. To
                    this day no memorial exists to the tens of thousands of Roma Holocaust
                    victims.</p>

                        assignment, was the environment your primary area of concentration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: Science and technology cooperation, climate change and environmental trade —
                    those were the basic issues. I observed the Paks nuclear facility in Central
                    Hungary. Paks is a meticulously managed plant, in a league of its own among the
                    former Soviet bloc nuclear reactors. It has developed a regional training center
                    to help scientists, technicians and engineers operate and maintain safe,
                    environmentally sound nuclear plants. Given the uphill challenges of achieving
                    nuclear safety in Russia and Eastern Europe, this is a vital service.</p>
                <p>I worked closely with the U.S.-Hungary Joint S&amp;T Fund in an effort to
                    identify alternative sources of financing. From the beginning, the Fund's staff
                    was first-rate. Dr. D�ra Gro� and her assistant, K�roly Zimbor�s, had years of
                    experience making things happen with scant resources. Their scientific
                    colleagues were great assets to me in the field. Over the past seven years the
                    Fund had financed cooperative research projects with a cumulative total of $10
                    million, contributed equally by the USG and the Hungarian government. It was a
                    model for other joint funds in the region, and most observers considered it to
                    be the best managed. The S&amp;T Fund directly engaged Hungarian scientists,
                    rather than the science institutes, which under Soviet influence were
                    bureaucratized and geared more toward pure research than to practical
                    applications. During the budget crisis of the mid 1990s, Secretary of State
                    Warren Christopher had decided to cut off funding. USAID kept up the matching
                    contributions for one year. The Fund ran for several more years on interest. But
                    the Department's short-sighted decision lost a precious resource that created
                    multiple returns.</p>
                <p>When Norbert Kro�, a renowned physicist and vice president of the Hungarian
                    Academy of Science, became Deputy Education Minister, I approached him about the
                    need to sign a GLOBE agreement. GLOBE is a worldwide project that Vice President
                    Gore had initiated to engage high school students in doing scientific and
                    environmental data collection and sharing their results with an internationally
                    accessible database. The U.S. had tried to get Hungary to participate for over
                    five years. The Education Ministry had stonewalled this in the past, partly from
                    territorial resistance to coordinating with the Foreign Ministry's science
                    experts. With a push by Kr�o and Bea Camp of USIS, we got the agreement signed.
                    Vice President Gore sent me a letter of appreciation. Our real thanks go to
                    Hungary's science community.</p>
                <p>One of the S&amp;T multi-year projects supported by Cornell University was led by
                    Dr. Istv�n Kajati and his “Healthy Apple Team” — scientists and plant protection
                    experts with Hungary's Soil Conservation Servicwho were promoting biological
                    alternatives to pesticides. I accompanied the team in several pilot projects as
                    they developed systems to certify integrated pest management methods, to
                    preserve more of the old apple varieties and market them. Hungary has a wealth
                    of apple species, with amazing taste and forms. Preserving this diversity would
                    be harder when they entered the EU.</p>

                    included gangland killings, political executions and completely fraudulent
                    elections in 1947. From then to the mid-'50s, they tried various forms of
                    collectivization that contributed to deep economic depression. During the
                    Khrushchev era they had to scale back these experiments. Here and there in the
                    countryside you see remnants of the collective farms, whose machinery and
                    buildings are rusting, abandoned. The worst damage to soil and water happened
                    when Soviet military bases dumped their spent fuels in retribution for being
                    ejected from Hungary.</p>
                <p>The Regional Environmental Center was a window into exciting trans-boundary
                    initiatives with respect to biodiversity, pollution prevention, environmental
                    management and citizen participation in Central, Eastern and Southeastern
                    Europe. It served as a clearinghouse for best practices and credible
                    environmental information. The REC had promoted early efforts to create
                    bi-national parks for cross-border natural resource protection. Under the
                    Soviets, the Hungary-Austria and Hungary-Yugoslavia border was off limits.
                    Protecting the ecosystems that stretch along these borders was a good way to
                    engage citizens and help overcome old ethnic feuds. The REC's Executive
                    Director, Jernej Stritih, a Slovenian, was exploring programs for post-war work
                    in Kosovo and Croatia and opening new offices in the newly independent states. I
                    learned a lot from Jernej about Slovenia's role in fighting the Serbs and

                <p>I worked closely with Esther Sz�venyi, the International Relations Director for
                    the Ministry of Environment, in several EPA-financed projects including wetlands
                    restoration and strategic planning. I represented the Embassy in ongoing talks,
                    both formal and informal, with the Environmental Minister and staff concerning
                    the 1997-98 Conference on Climate Change for the Kyoto Protocol. Hungary's top
                    climate change expert, Tibor Farago, was a member of the Kyoto technical
                    committee. We became close collaborators. Hungary's positions had an impact on
                    other C/EE countries, which were beginning to carve out a more independent
                    position in the talks. Hungary was open to the idea of emissions trading, which
                    the EU generally discouraged at the time. Ambassador Mark Hambley, the lead U.S.
                    negotiator on sustainable development issues, visited Budapest during a
                    technical meeting on climate change that Hungary hosted. Mark's rapport with the
                    C/EE delegates helped advance understanding of our positions while answering the
                    Hungarians' concerns.</p>
                <p>In 1998 USAID launched the Ecolinks campaign, an effort to promote opportunities
                    for U.S. environmental companies in southeastern Europe and the NIS countries
                    with Hungary as a partner. The first recipient was a project called the Living
                    Machine. This is a biological wastewater treatment system that uses completely
                    organic methods. It was developed in Vermont by Living Technologies. Attila
                    Bodn�r, a Hungarian architect who had been living in Vermont, had retrained as
                    an engineer to bring this program to his native country. I introduced Attila to
                    Robert McIntosh, the regional director of the Houston-based Trammel Crowe (TC),
                    the biggest U.S. company in real estate and office parks in the C/EE area.
                    Robert and his wife Susan were keen on environmental protection, and his firm
                    was looking for alternatives for industrial wastewater treatment for their
                    office parks and warehouse complexes in Budapest. It irked McIntosh that TC was
                    paying the municipalities to treat their wastewater; but local authorities were
                    still dumping the industrial waste directly into the Danube. He had talked to
                    scores of consultants sent by USAID, but none had proposed a realistic,
                    first-hand solution. I brought Attila Bodn�r together with Robert McIntosh in my
                    home and later introduced him to the Ecolinks director.</p>
                <p>The initial grant enabled Bodn�r to bring over experts and trim the budget to a
                    competitive level. The Living Machine project obtained a conceptual permit from
                    the municipal government of Budapest to treat industrial waste; shortly
                    afterward they were contracted to build an organic treatment center in an
                    environmentally sensitive area near Lake Balaton. The project later branched out
                    to Eastern and Southeastern Europe. Investing in sanitation is not something
                    that USAID sees as a public health priority. But it should be. Worldwide, an
                    estimated ninety percent of the world's sewage flows untreated into oceans,
                    rivers and lakes.</p>
                <p>A sad footnote — a year after my tour ended, I learned that Robert McIntosh had
                    died of a brain tumor. He was a visionary entrepreneur whose presence will be
                    greatly missed. Without his commitment the project would not have taken off.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: Not in a significant way. The first transition government arose out of an
                    amazing civic activism, creating new parties and institutions. Hungarians chose
                    a moderate Christian Democratic government that steered the country through a
                    rocky economic transition. The next administration was smoother, until they ran
                    into the Nagymaros conflict. Prime Minister Gyula Horn had been a lower-level
                    figure in the Communist Party before the transition. The PC changed its name and
                    the reform wing came to the fore, although time will tell how much they changed.
                    The deep-seated Mafia influence that exists east of the Carpathians was not
                    present in Hungary. Russians are not terribly popular there, as you can imagine.

                <p>The issue of organized crime was a concern for Hungarians as it was for the

                    this Budapest-based Academy that trains police officers in crime-fighting and
                    information-sharing techniques. Ambassador Tufo followed it closely. NGOs and
                    academics helped to shape the curriculum — particularly those specializing in
                    constitutional reform.</p>

                    delegations from the military side, as the Tasz�r base in southeastern Hungary
                    was a staging point for U.S. forces in the Balkans. I visited Tasz�r to learn
                    about its environmental management program, which was considerable. We later

                </p>
                <p>ROE: Turbulent, charming, haunting, never boring. The Embassy was located on
                    Szabads�g t�r (Freedom Square), just ten minutes by foot from where I lived in
                    Pest. It's an architectural jewel that had been used as a hospital in the
                    Renaissance period. The fa�ade is a pale yellow. It faces a spacious pedestrian
                    square with a giant Soviet monument to the liberation of Budapest from the
                    Nazis. The Embassy was renovated in 1991, and seemed destined to permanent waves
                    of subsequent renovation, for reasons that remain obscure. Dust, stress, and the
                    sound of wasted construction dollars were the result. Behind the Chancery stands
                    one of the most striking buildings in Budapest, the Postal Worker's Bank, an art
                    nouveau masterpiece by �d�n Lechner, a leading turn-of-the-century architect,
                    with fanciful details like angels' wings and beehives and a serpentine fa�ade of
                    Zsolnay tiles. Every time I gazed at this magical building, I saw another
                    amazing detail. When asked why he lavished so many resources on elements that
                    were not easily visible, the architect reportedly said he did it “for the
                    birds.”</p>
                <p>I lived near the Parliament building, with a view of Buda Castle across the
                    Danube. My apartment had one bedroom and a study, high ceilings, and the
                    slightly shabby elegance of the turn-of-the-century building where it resided. I
                    didn't need a car. On the street behind me, caf� society was percolating,
                    alternative films were shown, and an old bakery shop was a neighborhood chat
                    centesans internet. I loved the villamos, the yellow tramcars that can take you
                    to the Turkish baths or the opera in minutes. More often than not, I'd get a
                    ticket to an amazing performance at the last minute. I studied harp in my spare
                    time with �gnes Polonyi, a brilliant young musician from the Franz Liszt Academy
                    of Music (Zeneakad�mia), which was one of my temples. This was a music
                    conservatory and concert hall, vibrant with students and filled with art nouveau
                    frescoes and Zsolnay ceramic tiles. �gnes and her husband, an awesome violinist,
                    kept me abreast of the best concerts and alternative venues whenever they
                    performed.</p>

                <p>I developed close friendships with several colleagueMary McKinley, REC
                    Communications Director; Amy Modley, cultural projects liaison; Anna V�ri, a
                    researcher at the Hungarian Academy of Sciences' Conflict Resolution Institute;
                    REC advisor Janos Zlinsky; Claudia Spahl of the German Embassy and Laszlo
                    Letenyi, an anthropologist who was closely involved with the Roma community. I
                    visited the hinterlands every chance I could to hike, ride horseback, and
                    explore Hungary's medieval towns and fabulous legacy of historic and modernist
                    architecture. During weekend jaunts or visits from my husband Hector, my sister
                    Becky and other friends, we explored Lake Balaton, visited the Zolt�n Kod�ly
                    Institute in Kecskem�t, toured P�cs, Eger, and parts of neighboring Slovakia,
                    Poland and the Czech Republic. In 1999 my niece Riley Salyards, a senior at
                    Carnegie-Mellon University, came for a work-study program in theatre production
                    that exposed me to another Magyar dimension. I can't imagine anyone leaving
                    Budapest and not missing the city, the warmth of its people, its incredible
                    architecture and rich history.</p>
                <p>In my free time, or occasionally on trips facilitated by the Joint S&amp;T Fund,
                    I visited the managers and staff of Hungary's national parks — a dedicated,
                    inspiring group. During the Soviet occupation, many cooperated secretly with
                    their counterparts across the border to protect fragile cross-boundary
                    ecosystems. Some, like Dr. Csaba Aradi, Director of the Hortob�gy National Park
                    in Hungary's legendary Puszta Plains, are renowned ornithologists and
                    ecologists.</p>
                <p>One field trip I took to the Hortob�gy in October 1997 is still with me. A park
                    ecologist accompanied me to see the Great Bustards. Lying outstretched on the
                    ground in by a wheat field, I saw a small group of the legendary birds strut and
                    gabble to each other. At dusk we witnessed the migration of the common
                    (Eurasian) cranes, which are hardly common. In the wetlands ringing the northern
                    edge of the park, thousands of Eurasian cranes landed and rose again in strong
                    winds, trumpeting to each other in wave after wave as they sought places to rest
                    for the night. It was an awesome experience. I saw how fragile their migration
                    can be: neighboring farmers want the fish ponds to be deep, but the cranes need
                    shallow waters.</p>

                    Perhaps that's what most impacted me — the complicated Hungarian mind, the
                    impossibly beautiful language, a capital with dozens of historical and social
                    layers, and towns and countryside lost in time. Once I was invited to speak at a
                    commemorative event in the southwestern town of Nagyber�ny to honor Dr. Mikl�s
                    Faust, a Hungarian-born horticulturist and author who headed USDA's Plant
                    Research Division. He had accompanied the “Healthy Apple Team” during several
                    trips the Joint Fund organized in the agricultural and wine-growing regions. Dr.
                    Faust was a prolific author who helped innumerable researchers from his native
                    country. His sudden death shocked the science community. His close friends,
                    Istv�n Kajati and Ed� B�sz�rm�nyi, asked me to speak in Hungarian for the
                    ceremony. I practiced for a week, practicing my pronunciation with them during
                    the drive to Nagyber�ny. But when we arrived, the schoolteachers said their
                    students wanted me to speak in English! So I recited the first paragraph in
                    Magyar and spoke the rest in my native tongue. The whole town turned out for the

                    was appointed judge of the U.S. Southern District Court in the finance district
                    of New York. I'll jump forward here a moment — In 2004, Marrero wrote a landmark
                    decision overturning the Bush administration's Patriot Act that required U.S.
                    telephone providers to turn over records to the government without telling
                    customers. I spoke with him when I visited Ground Zero in New York City in the
                    winter of 2005. Judge Marrero's office sits directly across from the place where
                    the twin towers were struck by terrorists. He and his wife had worked for years
                    in the World Trade Center as attorneys. They were close friends with many of
                    those who died in the attack. I told him how proud I was of his efforts to
                    defend the U.S. Constitution.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Marrero departed in December 2001 for the federal bench. In February
                    2001 he was replaced by Luis Lauredo, a Cuban-American who had been working
                    closely with the press associations, NGOs and trade lobbies based in Miami. The
                    DCM of the USOAS Mission was Ron Godard, a great officer with whom I'd worked in
                    Chile in 1988-89. Ron had urged me to take the assignment. The Secretary General
                    of the OAS was Cesar Gaviria. When I served in Colombia, Gaviria was President
                    of that country. Now he was entering his second term as OAS SecGen.</p>
                <p>During my first year at USOAS there were major changes in my home life. I was
                    weaving two marvelous new stepchildren into my life. One was Norma Andrea, who
                    lives in Santiago. The other was Luis Felipe, who at age seven moved to our home
                    by way of New York from Colombia. His existence was unknown to me until that
                    time. Hector and I were in marriage counseling. The breach was large. We somehow
                    made it through, which is fortunate because we had so many responsibilities and
                    good memories in common. My mother learned she had cancer. She and my stepfather
                    moved to Colorado in 1998 to be closer to my sisters. I visited them frequently,
                    and they accepted Luis Felipe with open arms. The mission staff members who
                    needed to know were supportive. I was fortunate to be surrounded by really good
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We have a regular embassy to the OAS, down the road from
                        the State Department. How did that fit with your office?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>ROE: Yes, the OAS is at 17th Street and Constitution, a short walk from State. It
                    combines pre-Colombian elements in a stately Beaux-Arts style building. The
                    cavernous lobby with its soaring palm trees, glazed Aztec tiles and Georgian
                    marble fountain used to house parrots as well. Behind the main structure is the
                    Museum of the Americas, another jewel that sits outside the usual gallery tour,
                    but hosts a number of unusual exhibits.</p>
                <p>The U.S. mission to the OAS is technically an Embassy, as are most of the other
                    missions from the thirty-four countries that make up the OAS in North and South
                    America. The difference is its location within the State Department. Most of the
                    Caribbean countries also house their OAS missions within their Washington
                    embassies. The U.S. mission has its own budget line. Its principal goals are to
                    promote democracy, combat terrorism and drug trafficking, foster free trade and
                    promote sustainable economic development in cooperation with the other OAS
                    member countries.</p>
                <p>Multilateral diplomacy in the OAS has a lot in common with work within the UN
                    agencies. It involves steady research, relationship building, public speaking
                    and debate. We attend a myriad of meetings, wade through mountains of documents,
                    craft resolutions, mobilize with other countries to pass motions and shape
                    concrete projects. At any moment we need to be prepared to step up to the
                    microphone in a very public and often contentious setting. I managed a $2.5
                    million annual democracy fund appropriated by Congress. With this fund, the U.S.
                    is the primary financer of OAS electoral observation missions. We support a
                    variety of reform projects, dispute resolution programs and other activities
                    such as demining in Central America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Those would be particularly in Nicaragua and El
                        Salvador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: For demining, yes. Also, the historic 1990 election in Nicaragua was the
                    OAS's most robust election observation mission or EOM. Since then the OAS has
                    mounted nearly 100 EOMs and a range of projects to facilitate election reform
                    and help modernize civil registries and other election institutions. Many civil
                    society and Congressional leaders had criticized the OAS for not doing more when
                    democratic institutions were under siege, as they were in Peru in the 1990's.
                    The OAS approved Resolution 1080 during its 1991 General Assembly in Santiago,
                    Chile. Resolution 1080 empowered the organization to take action in crises
                    involving a coup or overt breach of constitutional order. OAS Ambassadors Luigi
                    Einaudi (U.S.) and Heraldo Mu�oz of Chile were key actors in achieving that
                    resolution. But there was still a gap. What about situations where democracy was
                    subverted from within? Most observers felt this was happening in Peru during the
                    mid to late 1990s. When I arrived at USOAS, DCM Ron Godard and WHA Assistant
                    Secretary Peter Romero were exploring ways to go beyond 1080 in a round of
                    meetings throughout the region. Many countries looked askance at any initiative
                    that would be seen as a U.S.-led attempt to engage the OAS in domestic
                    conflicts. The days of the old-style “Yankee intervention” have a long echo in
                    the hemisphere.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>A central part of my portfolio was coordinating with the OAS's Democracy
                    Promotion Unit (UPD), which was created in 1990 at the initiative of Canada and
                    the U.S. to defend and help spread democratic measures throughout the
                    hemisphere. In consultation with UPD staff, I drafted a resolution to facilitate
                    rapid response by the OAS secretary general to member states facing internal
                    conflicts that threatened their democratic institutions. To diffuse anxiety
                    about this mechanism, we called it a Democracy Fund and enlisted the support of
                    ten countries — with Canada, Argentina, Uruguay, and Chile in the leato propose
                    it. Mexico, Peru, Ecuador and Brazil resisted, fearing an assault on the sacred
                    notion of national sovereignty. DCM Ron Godard had led the consultations that
                    gave rise to this initiative. He tasked me with negotiating the resolution
                    through a working group of the Political/Juridical Committee.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get it through Haiti or particularly Brazil
                        and Mexico?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: You keep wordsmithing in endlessly long meetings conducted largely in
                    Spanish. These are endurance contests to see who can stand up longer in
                    negotiations. My right-hand ace was Margarita Riva-Geoghegan who directed the
                    development section of USOAS. Margarita had been with the mission since well
                    before the Einaudi years. She figured out ways for us to push through holes in
                    the opposition's arguments and helped draft compromise text. Our nemesis was
                    Peru. Its mission had an extremely vocal attorney, Ambassador Beatriz
                    Ramacciotti, who served as Fujimori's personal representative. She fought tooth
                    and nail against anything that might facilitate multilateral intervention in her
                    country. The Argentine perm rep, Raul Ricardez, was brilliant in outmaneuvering
                    Ramacciotti. Canadian Ambassador Peter Boehm also played a central role in this
                    fight.</p>
                <p>Then we had to decide what to do about the April 2000 elections in Peru.
                    Democracy activists, human rights organizations, and many observers in the
                    Congress and other countries were concerned that President Fujimori would do
                    anything to win a third term in office. He had put a lock on the country's
                    judicial system, subverted freedom of the press, and established the national
                    intelligence service (SIN) as the real seat of power. We thought there was a
                    chance that OAS could be more decisive than it had in any previous election. I
                    explored options with the Director of the UPD, Elizabeth Spehar; with Gaviria's
                    Chief of Staff, Fernando Jaramillo; and with Santiago Murray, a veteran UPD
                    staffer. Murray was close to Roger Noriega of the Senate Foreign Relations
                    Committee, which was pushing for action. Could the OAS do something audacious
                    enough to make a difference in monitoring the elections? Would it be willing to
                    speak out publicly and walk away from a bad election if necessary? The tentative
                    answer was yes. But based on past practice, UPD hands thought the Peruvian
                    mission would have to approve any EOM report in advance. I said no way would
                    that happen. First, because it would defeat the purpose. And second, because we
                    were pushing the clock. The election was in three months and we couldn't afford
                    to dither.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>On January 27, a George Washington University seminar hosted by Professor Cynthia
                    McClintock convened Peru-watchers from around the U.S. and the hemisphere.
                    Present were Peruvian NGOs, journalists and parliamentary representatives as
                    well as top U.S. academics and country experts. The NGOs held a closed-door
                    meeting after the seminar. Besides McClintock and Coletta Youngers of the
                    Washington Office on Latin America, the session included David Scott Palmer of
                    Boston University, Abe Loewenthal of the University of California, Peruvian
                    Congresswomen Graciela Fernandez Baca and Beatriz Merino, Sofia Macher of the
                    Peruvian Coordinadora Nacional de Derechos Humanos, Father Felipe MacGregor and
                    Rafael Roncagliolo of Transparencia Peru. I floated the idea for a different
                    type of OAS mission. Could it work? Would it have credibility? The consensus was
                    that the OAS was the only hope, with all its flaws, so this avenue must be
                    pursued.</p>
                <p>Our next challenge was how to get people from the Hill to talk with the
                    principals at the OAS. That was tricky because Congressional contacts by State
                    are strictly controlled by its legislative bureau, which is not known for
                    thinking outside the box.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, “H.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: So we encouraged the UPD, OAS' democracy office, to reach out to its allies
                    on the Hill to discuss the prospect with OAS SecGen Gaviria. I was picked to
                    represent USOAand to run the risks of getting “H” riled up. Roger Noriega of the
                    Senate Foreign Relations Committee showed up in a rumpled overcoat, looking like
                    a character out of the Maltese Falcon. (Roger knew the score, having spent two
                    years in the USOAS Mission as a Schedule C advisor to then-U.S. Ambassador Luigi
                    Einaudi. He was later named U.S. Ambassador to the OAS in August 2001.) This was
                    my first meeting with Roger in person. He had the reputation of being highly
                    distrustful of State, but we had a mutual friend at the mission in Margarita. We
                    met privately with SecGen Gaviria, UPD Director Spehar and OAS Chief of Staff
                    Jaramillo. (Prior to the meeting, I primed Jaramillo on the proposal). Gaviria
                    strongly supported the idea of an EOM that could speak out publicly in the event
                    of a rigged election. He agreed that the mission must be headed by a person of
                    great prestige and indisputable credibility. However Noriega said, “We're going
                    to need the proposal in writing for Senator Helms to look it over. He'll have to
                    have the final word.” We all said that would be a deal breaker. Roger apparently
                    wasn't willing to close the question. I went back to confer with Ron Godard and
                    draft the language for supporting an OAS electoral mission. Ron and I also
                    needed to convince Luis Lauredo, the newly appointed Ambassador, that this was
                    doable. He was very skeptical the OAS could lead in this area. Luis Lauredo
                    arrived after the GW seminar -</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: George Washington University </hi>

                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>ROE: Yes, the January 27 seminar. At the outset, Ambassador Lauredo didn't
                    realize how strongly the NGOs felt the OAS was needed to make a difference. He
                    soon came around. So we drafted a three-page letter that conditioned U.S.
                    financial support for an OAS EOM. This was a precedent-setting contract. Gaviria
                    confirmed he was considering as EOM chief Eduardo Stein, the ex- foreign
                    minister of Guatemala. Stein had negotiated that country's peace accords. He was
                    respected by civil society, had great personal integrity and an incredible
                    mastery of tough constitutional issues. Without spelling out his name, our
                    letter stated that the mission must be headed by a person of great independence
                    and credibility in the region. The mission had to be prepared to speak out as
                    often as necessary and to pay as much attention to the pre-electoral climate and
                    the legal and institutional framework as it would to the election procedures and
                    activities.</p>
                <p>As we were about to send this contract to the OAS, I faxed a copy to Roger
                    Noriega's office. He called immediately in a fury. Ambassador Lauredo passed the
                    call to me. Roger said, “This is outrageous. You can't do this without our
                    approval.” I said, “That wasn't the understanding — but wait a minute, have you
                    read the letter?” It turns out he hadn't. I pointed out the key paragraphs and
                    reminded him that “this is what we talked about with Gaviria.” He said, “But you
                    were supposed to call me.” I said, “I called you so often I was afraid your
                    office would think something funny was going on.” At that point he apologized
                    and said he didn't get the messages. (I apparently had been calling the central
                    number not his direct line.) Roger suggested even tougher language. It was good
                    material, but I was skeptical. Fortunately Ron Godard came up with an eloquent
                    way to incorporate the main point.</p>
                <p>We sent the letter to the UPD and then explored how to get Eduardo Stein on
                    board. OAS Chief of Staff Jaramillo had told me Stein needed to be convinced.
                    Ambassador Lauredo called him, stressing that this was a critical mission not
                    only for OAS's credibility but for democracy in the hemisphere. The chief of
                    mission had to have the authority to speak boldly on the issues of fairness
                    surrounding the electoral process.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: The OAS response was part of an emerging international consensus that
                    democracy had been severely eroded in Peru, that the rule of law was giving way
                    to a police state. Fujimori's administration intervened in the judiciary for
                    years, to the point where its independence was seriously compromised. By 2000,
                    more than eighty percent of the judges and prosecutors were in a provisional
                    status. He dismantled the constitutional court. The Peruvian Congress was
                    stripped of its oversight capacities. There was no civic control over the
                    military or the intelligence system. As the April 2000 elections approached,
                    Fujimori was on his way to manipulating his third term in office by destroying
                    any effective checks and balances.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>In contrast to traditional OAS observation missions, this EOM offered its
                    criticisms and recommendations publicly and in writing. EOM director Stein
                    identified three critical issues in consultation with the Peruvian Ombudsman's
                    office: equitable access to open-signal TV broadcasts and paid advertising;
                    adequate training of polling officials and workers and the provision of voter
                    education materials in native languages; and the national electoral commission's
                    voter computation and logistics system. The OAS Mission worked with government
                    and non-government actors to address these problems, but given Fujimori's
                    stance, they were insurmountable. After the first electoral round, Stein
                    reported that the entire election process was seriously flawed. Opposition
                    candidates had been harassed and threatened; the votes tallied greatly exceeded
                    the numbers of those who voted; the signatures to register one of the
                    pro-Fujimori political movements were proven to be massively forged; there was
                    no official mechanism for investigating fraud; and citizens' political
                    participation was repeatedly blocked.</p>
                <p>In a momentous decision, Stein, with the backing of SecGen Gaviria, stated
                    publicly that the elections were neither free nor fair. He pulled the EOM in
                    protest. When the OAS took action, all the other international observation corps
                    — the UN, National Democratic Institute, International Republican Institute, the
                    Carter Center, the EU mission — also refused to participate. This had never
                    occurred in such dramatic form in the international arena. Fujimori was elected
                    without any opposition in the second, disputed round of balloting on May 28,
                    2000. The case then went to the OAS.</p>
                <p>Eduardo Stein made his report to an OAS permanent council meeting in May. His
                    meticulous account sparked a furious debate. Several Caribbean and Central
                    American countries joined Chile, Argentina, the U.S. and Canada, stating that
                    the OAS was right to challenge a fraudulent vote. The Peruvians lobbied
                    ferociously, trying to block any action. Many ambassadors were acting without
                    instructions from their capitals. They deferred the decision to the June OAS
                    General Assembly in Windsor, Canada.</p>
                <p>The decision to move the debate to the OASGA (General Assembly) was a de facto
                    invocation of Resolution 1080. This was the first time that the spirit of 1080
                    and its sense of urgent action had been invoked in a situation that was an
                    internal takeover of a democratic government.</p>

                <p>ROE: The U.S., Canada, Argentina and Chile were committed to the promotion of
                    democracy and to the concept of preventive diplomacy. The point was to
                    strengthen the OAS's capacity to do something about crises before they'd gotten
                    out of control. Uruguay, Paraguay, Central America and many of the smaller
                    Caribbean countries were sympathetic to this argument. The Caribbean
                    representatives also disliked the arrogance of the Fujimori-era Peruvian
                    representatives, whom some perceived as practically racist. Brazil and Ecuador
                    and especially Venezuela took Peru's side. Venezuelan Foreign Minister (and
                    later Vice President) Jose Vicente Rangel made long tirades on the floor of the
                    OASGA. His eyes bored holes into anyone daring to speak in favor of Eduardo
                    Stein or propose democratic reform measures. Mexico worked with Brazil behind
                    the scenes and on the floor to prevent a vigorous OAS response, citing concerns
                    about intervention.</p>
                <p>A major OAS founding principle was respect for national sovereignty. By 2000, an
                    independent panel established at the request of UN Secretary General Kofi Anan
                    reinterpreted the concept of sovereignty to include the principle of “do no
                    harm.” The panel, chaired by Canada, concluded that the international community
                    has a moral obligation to act collectively to prevent genocide or the systematic
                    destruction of human rights. That resolution, supported by Anan, states that
                    intervention is warranted if government abuse is such that citizens have no
                    recourse. Eduardo Stein was a member of that international panel.</p>
                <p>We anticipated a stormy debate at the OASGA in Windsor. Late Friday night, on the
                    eve of our departure for Windsor, I finished drafting and faxed a proposed
                    resolution on Peru to the Canadian DCM, Renata Wielgosz. Renata and I faxed
                    edits back and forth to each other in our deserted missions until well past
                    midnight. The resolution we worked up that night was the basis for the one
                    eventually adopted by the OASGA. It proposed sending Canadian Foreign Minister
                    Lloyd Axworthy and OAS SecGen Gaviria to Peru to initiate a dialogue for
                    broad-based reform and report back to the Permanent Council.</p>
                <p>During the General Assembly, I suggested holding caucus meetings with the
                    Caribbean delegation and the Central American reps. These were turning points.
                    Raul Ricardez, the Permanent Representative for Argentina, was eloquent in
                    convincing the caucuses to support the resolution. During the session, before
                    responding to Ricardez' message, Ambassador Kingsley Lane (St. Vincent) said:
                    “When a barracuda swims to shore to tell you there's a shark in the water, you'd
                    better listen!” The Caribbean group made impassioned speeches in favor of
                    democratic reform, along with other southern cone and Central American
                    delegates. Venezuela, Peru and their allies still resisted. Halfway through the
                    floor debate, Ambassador Pickering made an appearance—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the Undersecretary—</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>ROE: Yes, the Undersecretary of State for political affairs. Ambassador Pickering
                    arrived at the last minute to head our delegation. I believe he had been
                    attending his son's college graduation. His arrival was unexpected. It created a
                    stir in the room. Pickering took the participants off in a room and hammered out
                    an agreement. In the end even Peru had to join in the consensus that authorized
                    an OAS mission to address the separation of powers, electoral system reform,
                    freedom of information and political human rights.</p>
                <p>The “high level mission” left a month later, in July. The day before its
                    departure, I spoke separately with Jaramillo and Wielgosz about framing the
                    issues. They were open to suggestions. I brought Jaramillo a roadmap that
                    Ambassador John Hamilton had prepared in consultation with civil society,
                    independent government and opposition experts in Lima. Jaramillo and Wielgosz
                    informally accepted it as the starting point as the OAS mission established an
                    on-going presence in Lima.</p>
                <p>It was rough going at first, but by August the OAS “mesa de dialogo” was well
                    underway. The negotiators had set forth a framework for action on electoral
                    reform, the development of an independent judiciary, a free press and civilian
                    control of the military. Early on, they engaged the social actorthe church,
                    business, the unions, human rights groups and the public defendethat had felt
                    the brunt of the police state. Then came the revelation of big-time corruption
                    and bribes involving Vladimir Montesinos, the shadowy head of Peru's
                    intelligence service (SIN) —</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was very close to Fujimori.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: Montesinos had become the power behind the throne. He was tied into illegal
                    arms sales, some involving the guerrilla army (FARC) of Colombia. (You can
                    imagine how this infuriated Gaviria.) Montesinos was involved in torture. He was
                    involved in paramilitary activities. When videotapes surfaced demonstrating the
                    bribes to Montesinos, things quickly catapulted. On September 16, after a
                    dramatic airport meeting with Gaviria, Fujimori called for early elections and
                    said he would deactivate the SIN. Within the next two months, a national
                    political accord was drafted with all the key national actors. It led to an
                    amended constitution. Peruvians went to the polls on April 8 to elect Alejandro
                    Toledo as the first indigenous president in the hemisphere. OAS mission left an
                    unmistakable footprint. Without its presence, a peaceful transition would most
                    likely not have been possible.</p>
                <p>Another unforeseen outcome was an idea floated at the February '01 conference of
                    the Community of Democracies, hosted by the OAS in Washington. Diego
                    Garcia-Say�n, the Justice Minister of Peru's post-Fujimori, interim government,
                    informed us he would ask that the OAS systematize the Windsor resolution and its
                    previous democracy promotion clauses into a new declaration of political rights.
                    He proposed a new charter for the Americas. The initiative was bold and
                    promising. But how could it avoid being bogged down in lengthy interagency
                    processes or in endless OAS debates?</p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>Tom Shannon, the new DCM for USOAS, was U.S. Summit Coordinator. Shannon saw an
                    opportunity in the Summit of the Americas which Canada was to host in the
                    spring. Canada, the U.S., Argentina, Chile, Costa Rica and Peru began drafting
                    texts for an OAS political charter. The April '01 Quebec Summit — with all the
                    presidents and prime ministers in attendance — approved language instructing
                    their foreign ministers to prepare an Inter-American Democratic Charter (IACD)
                    to codify OAS principles and strengthen its mechanisms for acting in defense of
                    representative democracy.</p>
                <p>Then negotiations began in earnest on the details of the Democratic Charter.
                    Working closely with Shannon was Marshall Brown, an inspired, dedicated attorney
                    on loan from State's legal staff. They made the most of this unique opportunity.
                    Several Caribbean delegations, led by Ambassador King, insisted that the IADC
                    had not taken their social concerns sufficiently into account. The June OASGA
                    was unable to approve the Charter. Finally the differences were worked out. With
                    only Venezuela abstaining, the Charter was approved by the OAS in a special
                    General Assembly in Peru on September 11, 2001.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 9/11.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: Yes, it coincided with the Al Qaeda attack. Secretary of State Colin Powell
                    attended the special OASGA in Lima. When the planes hit the U.S. Trade Center,
                    he was on the floor and had to depart, but not before taking part in the
                    ratification of the Democratic Charter. Before the Secretary left, the OAS
                    expressed its support for the U.S. and its outrage over the terrorist
                    attacks.</p>
                <p>No international organization has come as far in defining the elements of a
                    democratic society. The IADC codifies all previous OAS actions from its
                    formation regarding the promotion of democracy and puts them all in one slim
                    book. Its 28 articles include the issues of press freedom, institutional checks
                    and balances, free and fair election processes, labor rights, education for
                    democracy, and many more. I was in the chair the day the worker rights clause
                    was introduced by the Ambassador from Antigua, Lionel Alexander Hurst. I
                    immediately conferred with Argentine Perm Rep Ricardez, and we agreed it was a
                    valuable addition. Many of the articles were fought over intensely, but that one
                    stayed without major challenge.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where was the initiative coming from? Did you feel that
                        because of the natural suspicion of so many of these countries in Latin
                        America that we needed to be out of the limelight as much as possible?</hi>

                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>ROE: At that point in history, the U.S. had political credit in the bank. Still,
                    we took pains to keep a reasonably low profile. The idea was completely Peru's.
                    In fact, when Justice Minister Garcia-Say�n proposed the idea in a speech at the
                    Community of Democracies meeting at OAS, we first thought, “that's great, but
                    good luck.” The concept had been evolving over the past decade. It evolved from
                    the formation of the UPD in 1990, a Canadian initiative, and the 1991 passage of
                    Resolution 1080, a U.S. and Chilean initiative. The Charters of CARICOM, the
                    trade-related organization of the Caribbean states, and of MERCOSUR (Argentina,
                    Paraguay, Brazil and Uruguay) also included basic democracy clauses. Since the
                    OAS General Assembly of 1999, the U.S. and its allies explored ways to improve
                    on what was called the “Resolution 1080 mechanism” to allow the OAS to react
                    swiftly when it saw major threats to democratic institutions and the rights of
                    citizens. What was unusual was the very short space from the time Peru floated
                    the idea to when it was codified in the Charteless than eight months. Now,
                    putting the IADC fully into action will take many multiples of that time.</p>

                        that it was not on board?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: President Hugo Chavez was elected as a populist at a time when the party
                    system was breaking down in Venezuela. The country was a forerunner of democracy
                    in the Americas, but its institutions had become ossified. Like many nations
                    that depend on the petroleum industry, it developed serious corruption and huge
                    social-economic disparities. After his election, Chavez moved to curtail
                    political rights and to cripple independent unions and business organizations.
                    He set out to establish a state that would resemble that of Cuba more than other
                    country in the hemisphere. Venezuela by no means wanted to see the OAS intervene
                    to help people in Peru gain more space and liberty. So the Venezuelan diplomats
                    vigorously opposed any action by the OAS and did their best to filibuster the
                    Democracy Charter. In the end they abstained from the final resolution.</p>

                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>ROE: I was involved in an intense inter-agency debate over the issue of expanding
                    opportunities and political participation for native Americans. Indigenous
                    peoples number an estimated 50 million in the Americas. In many countries —
                    Guatemala, Peru, Bolivia and Paraguanative Americans constitute a majority.
                    Historically they've been marginalized and exploited. But during recent years
                    indigenous movements have emerged to reshape the political equation. For more
                    than a decade the OAS sought to negotiate a declaration of indigenous rights for
                    the Americas, a parallel effort to the international negotiations in the UN.
                    Oddly, the U.S. positioned itself as the rear guard of that debate by sticking
                    to a legalistic definition of the term “peoples.” From the start of talks, the
                    Department of Interior and the Justice Department locked horns with the State
                    Department on this issue. Interior and Justice argued for a more open
                    interpretation that would harmonize our domestic and international policies.
                    U.S. domestic law recognizes the inherent right of Native American tribes to a
                    distinct sovereign status that is incorporated into our constitutional
                    framework. The Congress has also consistently supported tribal rights to
                    self-government. But at State an evangelically inspired attorney in “L,” Mike
                    Dennis, monopolized this issue, resisting like Custer any change in the
                    Department's position. He argued that recognizing self-determination could
                    adversely impact other sensitive international issues including the Palestinian
                    conflict.</p>
                <p>We began consulting with counterparts in Interior and Justice, with senior OAS
                    experts, with the Democracy, Rights and Labor division of State, with Canada,
                    Guatemala and Peru, and with representatives of U.S. tribal organizations. As a
                    result, State developed consensus language that was adopted by the Quebec City
                    Summit of the Americas. The decision concerning OAS negotiations went up the
                    ladder to the White House, and the National Security Council finally brokered a
                    presidential directive issued in January 2001, in the midnight hours of the
                    Clinton administration. The White House directive said that self-determination
                    could be regarded as an internal right without necessary implications for
                    international self-determination; with that context being clearly defined, the
                    term “peoples” could be used.</p>
                <p>I drafted the U.S. statement for OAS Deputy Chief of Mission Tom Shannon, who
                    played a pivotal behind the scenes role throughout the White House negotiations.
                    The change in U.S. position came like a lightning bolt at the indigenous
                    negotiations in April 2001. It helped move the talks forward. The diehard
                    elements in State's legal division mounted a major back-channel fight. But the
                    Bush White House basically ratified the decision made by the Clinton
                    administration. This was an important signal that the U.S. wanted to help
                    strengthen the voices of indigenous communities and engage them in a more
                    productive dialogue with their own governments.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>A number of countries including Peru, Colombia, Venezuela, Honduras, Guatemala,
                    and Panama approved constitutions that recognized indigenous people's
                    traditional forms of social organization, their rights to local sovereignty.
                    Many indigenous representatives had been elected to parliaments. But too often
                    their communities have encountered neglect, frustration, and confrontation in
                    dealing with national governments. After centuries of our own sorry history, the
                    U.S. practice has become one of the more advanced in the hemisphere. We wanted
                    to use this experience to focus on the education, resources and best practices
                    that could make a difference in the hemisphere. For example, the Canadians had
                    begun working with tribes in Ecuador on issues such as sustainable logging,
                    development of natural gas resources and environmental enterprises.</p>

                <p>ROE: I was in USOAS from 1999 to 2001. We had an exceptionally creative and
                    dedicated stafJean Preston, Richard Miles and later Mary Stickles in the
                    political section. Retired FSOs Jim Todd and Jerry Hoganson brought phenomenal
                    institutional memory, energy and insights to these initiatives. With their �lan
                    we were able to tackle a range of related issues from human rights and the
                    creation of an OAS Rapporteur for Press Freedom to cooperation on sustainable
                    development, demining and terrorism. During the Windsor OASGA former U.S.
                    Ambassador Luigi Einaudi won a contested election for OAS Assistant Secretary
                    General by an impressive margin. In 2000 Jerry Hoganson worked to gain Senate
                    ratification of the landmark Inter-American Convention against Corruption that
                    had been signed by the U.S. and 22 other OAS members in 1996, well before
                    similar conventions were approved by the OECD and the UN. Richard Miles and
                    Marshall Brown from “L” then worked with our OAS interlocutors to develop a
                    multilateral evaluation mechanism for the convention.</p>
                <p>Based on the successful OAS experience in Peru, we recommended that the Congress
                    increase its support for the Mission's Democracy Fund from $2.5 to $3.5 million.
                    Eventually, this increase won Hill support. During my last six months I explored
                    ways to revive the OAS anti-terrorism committee (CICTE). CICTE was created in
                    October 1999 but had received scant support from State's own counter-terrorism
                    division (S/CT). In January 2001, S/CT informed us they wanted to pull the plug.
                    I set up talks with Argentina, Uruguay, Mexico, Granada and other interested
                    countries. Finding broad support, we pushed back, got S/CT to name an interim
                    chair, and included a clause supporting CICTE in the Quebec City Summit Plan of
                    Action. We held a planning session in July, and S/CT approved $100,000 for a
                    training conference just before the Special OASGA on September 11, 2001. After
                    the attack on the twin towers, CICTE had its work cut out.</p>

                    OAS on support for political party training. I focused on the intersection of
                    trade and labor issues, a major focus of the Summits of the Americas. In the

                        was strong in the United States and also had very strong partners in the
                        Latin American labor movement. By this time did you feel a fire had gone
                        out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: The old fires are embers now, although some new sparks are out there. Job
                    outsourcing, structural workforce changes, and a hostile political climate
                    contributed to a huge erosion of union membership in recent decades. As millions
                    of manufacturing jobs dissolved, many communities lost the stable economic
                    backbone that was their working class base. Large corporations have invested
                    heavily in legalized union busting. Under the Reagan, Bush I and II
                    administrations these activities won a Presidential seal. The economic pendulum
                    has swung towards Wall Street and the business elite. Financial services have
                    gained the lion's share of the economy. This comes with a high price. The U.S.
                    is more and more dependent on foreign imports and foreign infusions of capital.
                    Working people's buying power has declined, and the gap between rich and poor
                    has grown exponentially. Americans' perception that the economy's rewards aren't
                    fairly distributed has whipped up a potent backlash against trade
                    liberalization.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>In the political arena, unions still pack more clout than their numbers would
                    indicate. New organizations like “9 to 5” have organized free-lance employees,
                    clerical workers and household employees in a number of cities. Unions and
                    workplace associations emerged as significant forces for democratic change in
                    Poland, South Africa, Brazil, China and Cuba. Unions help deconcentrate power.
                    At their best, they train citizens in techniques to build open political
                    systems. What U.S. steelworkers leader John L. Lewis said in the 1930s is still
                    true: the power to contract, to have a voice in determining the conditions under
                    which one works, is the difference between free labor and serfdom.</p>
                <p>The rights of workers as codified in the 1948 Universal Declaration of Human
                    Rights and the 1998 Declaration by the ILknown as labor rule of laemerged as an
                    important U.S. foreign policy consideration. Since the mid-1980s, Congress
                    passed nearly two dozen pieces of legislation linking respect for
                    internationally-recognized worker rights to public investment and trade policy.
                    These were the central planks for the General System of Preferences (GSP) and
                    the Caribbean and Andean Trade Policy Acts. The Overseas Private Investment
                    Corporation (OPIC) by law must ensure that the foreign investment projects it
                    supports protect internationally recognized worker rights. During the 1990s the
                    Labor Department and the ILO developed programs to train worker rights monitors,
                    improve health and safety practices, and combat child labor in developing
                    countries. Under pressure from NGOs, U.S. business like Reeboks developed

                <p>ROE: In 2001 I became senior labor advisor in the policy planning office of WHA
                    (Western Hemisphere bureau). I advised the front office and the desks on
                    trade-related labor standards, indigenous rights, political party assistance and
                    specific policy issuefor example, how the Administration should approach
                    President Lula of Brazil, taking his experience as a labor and democracy
                    movement leader into account. I was liaison with the Washington office of ILO,
                    and with U.S. labor, private sector and civil society organizations on trade and
                    worker rights issues. I took part in interagency efforts to monitor trade
                    agreements with respect to implementation of labor clauses and in a National
                    Academy of Sciences effort to develop baselines for monitoring compliance with
                    core labor standards. I joined the negotiating team for the U.S.-Chile Free
                    Trade Agreement and for the trade pacts the U.S. signed with the Central
                    American countries. We were exploring ways to include enforceable labor clauses
                    like those in the U.S.-Jordan trade agreement, and taking the initial steps to
                    extend them to Peru and Colombia. It was a lively portfolio.</p>

                        hemisphere from your perspective or from the labor point of view?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: Latin America is a dynamic region that has made tremendous progress in
                    popular sovereignty, economic development and fiscal management. Still, in
                    certain countries economic reforms went only halfway, leaving major barriers to
                    entrepreneurship and innovation. The potential for more sustainable development
                    remains very large. Many of the region's citizens are struggling for ways to
                    share in the growing prosperity. This directly affects the U.S. The majority of
                    our immigrants come from south of the border. Economic distress and lack of
                    opportunities drive them here, along with the lure of jobs.</p>
                <p>With some glaring exceptions, free and fair elections have become the norm. Among
                    the big challenges are the need to create jobs, broad-based education,
                    responsive police and health systemand the fight against child labor, child
                    soldiers, and transnational criminal organizations. The spread of globalization
                    accentuated problems of socio-economic exclusion, especially for poor farmers,
                    indigenous and Afro-Hispanic communities. Those living in Mexico, Central
                    America and the Andean countries are concerned their manufacturing jobs will be
                    pulled away to China and Southeast Asia. Labor and occupational standards are
                    poorly enforced. Workers who organize face huge obstacles. Bribes, blacklists
                    and bureaucracy hinder development in too many places.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>On the U.S. side, we're seeing growing scrutiny by Congress and civil society
                    organizations concerning workplace conditions south of the border. U.S. trade
                    agendas include not only rules for commerce in agricultural and industrial goods
                    but also provisions for intellectual property, investments, transparency,
                    environmental and labor standards, and dispute settlement. Inter-agency
                    negotiating teams work in each of these areas. Once concluded, the agreements
                    require countries to devote significant resources to these standards. For
                    example, in the case of Ecuador, USTR made improvements in labor rights a
                    precondition for beginning FTA talks. Labor was a make-or-break issue for the
                    accords we negotiated with Chile and Central American countries, because the
                    margin for Congressional passage was razor-thin at best.</p>
                <p>The Dymel case in Guatemala is a case in point. It involved OPIC, WHA, the
                    Democracy, Rights and Labor (DRL) Bureau, the U.S. Embassy in Guatemala, the
                    Guatemalan government, a large U.S. electric and construction company.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Dymel being what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: A construction firm then located in Guatemala. OPIC had provided
                    multi-million dollars in investment support to Tampa Electric Company (TECO) to
                    build and operate a coal-fired power plant in Guatemala. TECO used a Kellogg,
                    Brown &amp; Root subsidiary as its engineering, procurement and construction
                    (EPC) contractor. The EPC contractor then subcontracted much of the construction
                    work to Dymel, which was owned by an El Salvadoran citizen and his partnership.
                    Numerous labor violations occurred during the project's construction phase. A
                    group of 150 workers formed a union after their warnings about safety hazards
                    weren't heeded, and a worker was electrocuted causing his death. In response,
                    they filed an organizing petition and along the way became knowledgeable on
                    labor law, even though none had previously been part of a union organizing
                    campaign. Despite tremendous pressure from management, about 72 workers
                    continued to pursue the petition. Dymel fired them all with the apparent
                    knowledge of the Brown &amp; Root subsidiary and TECO's Guatemalan staff. The
                    workers won five court cases recognizing their trade union rights courts that
                    were upheld by Guatemala's Supreme Court, but Dymel's owners closed shop and
                    moved back to El Salvador. Despite the court rulings, none of the workers were
                    rehired at the plant.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>OPIC financing triggered our engagement. OPIC must enforce strict labor and
                    environmental standards on their projects. We wanted a remedy for the workers,
                    who were demonstrating every day in front of Guatemalan government offices,
                    often with anti-American signs. The Department, the U.S. Embassy, and Guatemalan
                    officials shared concerns about the vulnerable position of the trade package in
                    Congress. At first we didn't suspect that U.S. corporate actors were involved in
                    violating worker rights. Initially, we were nudging the government of Guatemala
                    to implement its own labor laws. Sandra Polaski, the special representative for
                    labor in DRL, spearheaded these efforts together with OPIC environmental and
                    labor officer Greg Maggio; Marc Garfinkel, OPIC Vice President, and the legal
                    staff of OPIC. As Sandra was departing State to head the trade department at the
                    Carnegie Endowment, I took her place on this project. I co-chaired with OPIC two
                    fact-finding missions to Guatemala in close cooperation with Ambassador
                    Hamilton, labor attach� Erik Hall, and COVERCO, a Guatemalan human rights NGO.
                    Our team engaged the top levels of the Guatemalan government including the vice
                    president, the foreign minister, the trade minister, the economy minister, and
                    the labor minister. The Guatemalan officials were concerned about the issue of
                    cross-boundary law enforcement. They formed an inter-agency task force to pass
                    labor reform legislation and tighten their own lax enforcement.</p>
                <p>Along the way, lengthy testimony that Greg Maggio took from the Dymel workers
                    revealed that officers of the U.S. EPC contractor were directly implicated. I
                    took part in these interviews, which were detailed, credible and very
                    disturbing. Back in Washington, the dialogue got intense. At one point the legal
                    counsel for Kellogg, Brown &amp; Root asked for my take on the situation as he
                    was about to go into a board meeting. OPIC had made it clear they risked being
                    debarred from any future U.S. government contracts if a solution was not found.
                    I said the charges were serious and well-founded, that we had direct knowledge
                    of labor law violations, and that they had better clean up their act. In October
                    2002, OPIC negotiated a 1.12 million dollar settlement with the EPC contractor,
                    whose intermediate parties in Guatemala paid it directly to the workers.
                    However, the story did not end happily. Even after the favorable court rulings
                    and financial settlement, Guatemalan power and construction employers continued
                    to blacklist the Dymel workers. Although the employers denied doing this, the

                        able to get at or at least begin to set up something to go after people who

                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>ROE: We proposed language for the labor section of the trade agreement to address
                    this issue, but it didn't get inter-agency support. Our proposals for
                    enforceable labor standards met a similar fate. USTR cited resistance by key
                    Congressional committee leaders. These are reciprocal agreements. If the U.S.
                    can press other countries to raise their labor standards, we are subject to the
                    same pressureand many conservatives on the Hill don't want see that happen.
                    Despite that resistance, enforceable labor standards were incorporated into the
                    free trade agreement for Peru. Other provisions that improve the dispute rules
                    and strengthen transparency were accepted. Because CAFTA (the Central American
                    Free Trade Agreement) is a multi-country agreement, it puts the players on
                    notice to address festering problems. Any issue not solved at the informal level
                    goes to dispute settlement. There's a fairly tight timeline. If no solution is
                    found, a fine is levied and those resources are specifically to be used to
                    remedy the problem. If the problem isn't resolved in the end, there is a cutoff
                    of trade. But there's no guarantee.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we look upon Mexico at the time? I imagine this
                        country as being our closest neighbor and almost our biggest trading
                        partner.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: Mexico was the first to have a tri-party trade agreement with the U.S. and
                    Canada involving labor standards. A number of cases came up through NAFTA
                    regarding labor rights violations, and some complaints were brought against the
                    U.S. concerning the social benefits and rights of migrant workers. But NAFTA
                    lacks teeth on environmental and labor issues. Its dispute settlement process
                    can drag out for years. The U.S. Congress did not want to replicate this
                    model.</p>
                <p>Under other NAFTA provisions, the U.S. Department of Labor has worked
                    cooperatively with Mexico to address common labor concerns with Mexico. During
                    the past few years, experts from both countries collaborated to modernize the
                    labor justice system and implement tougher occupational safety and health
                    standards in the workplace. We also saw the first independent trade unions
                    organized in Mexico with assistance from the same university-based coalitions
                    that are pressing for fair trade. These fledgling organizations have yet to
                    develop as nationwide trade unions. They are still in the shadows.</p>
                <p>Public concern is focused on the growing criminal activity linked to the drug
                    cartels and the seedier side of labor relations, the gruesome, unsolved killings
                    of young female workers in the border towns, the poor housing conditions around
                    the maquiladoras that operate there, the lack of decent services and
                    infrastructure. NAFTA was an unfulfilled opportunity to mobilize resources to
                    improve the lives and environment for Mexicans and their U.S. neighbors. Post
                    9/11, the focus has shifted to immigration and the need to secure our borders.
                    But putting up walls won't fix the problem. Any effective policy will have to
                    address this issue cooperatively, not simply as an enforcement matter, but also
                    as a social phenomenon arising from economic ills that reach across the
                    border.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now the Assistant Secretary at the time was Roger
                        Noriega?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: In 2001, Roger Noriega was U.S. Ambassador to OAS. When I came to PPC, Peter
                    Romero was Assistant Secretary. He was replaced by Otto Reich. When Congress
                    didn't approve his nomination, Reich remained one year in an interim appointment
                    and then Roger Noriega became A/S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know what the problem was for Reich?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: The issue was his past involvement in the Contras issue. Reich was
                    Ambassador to Venezuela under President Reagan, and before that he'd been a
                    hardball player in the Central American conflict. He had many enemies on the
                    Hill. To the limited extent we came in contact, Reich was attentive to the
                    socio-economic issues in my area. His mother had been active in the
                    Communications Workers Union in Cuba. Reich told me his master's thesis was on
                    labor rights. He was direct and unbureaucratic in his approach. Like Noriega he
                    brought in many conservative political appointees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about when Noriega came in? Had he also been rather
                        controversial?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: Roger was a combative figure when he worked for Senator Jesse Helms on the
                    Hill. That was a time of escalating political warfare between the Democrats and
                    the Republicans. Senators Dodd and Helms and their staff harbored enmities on
                    the order of the Hatfields and the McCoys, and Helms broadcasted his disdain for
                    the State Department, the UN and most international organizations. When he was
                    on the Hill, Noriega took credit for blocking numerous Department nominees for
                    ambassador on ideological grounds. That created bad blood.</p>
                <p>As U.S. Ambassador to the OAS, Noriega was in his element, much more so than when
                    he later served as Assistant Secretary. Roger knew the OAS, sensed its potential
                    and was instrumental on the Hill in facilitating Senate consent for the
                    Inter-American Convention on Corruption in record time. He called me directly
                    when the vote took place. I appreciated this, as the convention had been a USOAS
                    priority for some time. I sat in on staff meetings when he was Mission director.
                    Roger had a collegial style and a droll sense of humor. He engaged actively in
                    the OAS. He advocated democratic freedom for Cuba in a way that raised eyebrows,
                    but may have bolstered efforts by the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights
                    to spotlight the issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>In a separate effort following the 2003 arrests of dozens of independent trade
                    union activists, writers and journalists in Havana, I worked closely with Robert
                    Hagen from the U.S. Mission in Geneva, the National Endowment for Democracy's
                    Latin American Director Chris Sabatini, Tony Freeman (former DAS in State and
                    then Washington Director of ILO) and Stan Gacek of the AFL-CIO to get high-level
                    attention from the ILO. In June 2003, for the first time in a decade, the ILO
                    governing body issued a report sharply criticizing the Cuban government for
                    systematic and deep-going violations of international labor standards. What
                    seemed like a natural step was preceded by months of letter-writing, testimony
                    and behind the scenes lobbying. That was a small but gratifying victory.</p>
                <p>A more influential Administration figure was Ambassador Robert Zoellick, the U.S.
                    trade representative — and briefly Deputy Secretary of State under Condoleezza
                    Rice. In the field, USTR has a reputation of imposing its will and being
                    heavy-handed. But in Central America and Chile, I saw Zoellick thoroughly
                    engaged, showing finesse and understanding of the labor rights issue. Zoellick
                    worked closely with USTR's labor advisor, William (Bud) Clatanoff. Clatanoff, a
                    former U.S. labor counselor in Japan, is a curmudgeon who plays his cards very
                    close to the chest. But he knows his stuff. We had a strong inter-agency group
                    where USTR, DOL, and State hammered out negotiating positions and monitored
                    labor and worker rights developments in key countries. Whenever Ambassador
                    Zoellick visited a country, he worked to advance this agenda.</p>

                        It was happening in Europe and certainly in the Middle East.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: There was a global mushrooming of anti-American sentiment. Much of the
                    increase was associated with U.S. policies and attitudes. Most foreigners
                    clearly distinguish their feelings toward Americans from their attitudes toward
                    the U.S. government. The 9/11 attacks of 2001 generated great sympathy for the
                    U.S. in this hemisphere and throughout the world. Even Cuba and Iran briefly
                    offered to cooperate with our counter-terrorism efforts. That wave of support
                    dissipated when the U.S. invaded Iraq without clear cause or UN support. The
                    Administration's unilateralism created lasting scars in the region. We bullied
                    our allies, including those like Chile and Mexico who sought to forge a
                    compromise agreement on the issue. The motto was “follow us or else.” As the
                    U.S. became bogged down in regime change in the Middle East, our allies had the
                    perception that we were abandoning the development agenda, turning from our own
                    democratic principles, and even losing our basic competence. The Argentine
                    meltdown coincided with the crisis of U.S. credibility.</p>

                </p>
                <p>ROE: Right. It effectively removed an important U.S. ally from the arena. You had
                    the rise of Hugo Chavez who tried to make himself into the little Fidel of
                    Venezuela while using oil resources to pump up his friends in the Hemisphere.
                    Chavez used the pretext of the failed 2003 coup to shut down opposing voices in
                    Caracas. Bolivia experienced a popular revolt. President S�nchez de Lozada
                    stepped down at gunpoint. There's fertile breeding ground for leaders like Evo
                    Morales and Chavez, who are throwbacks to the caudillo era. The region is still
                    in the throes of far-reaching change. The Andean countries have spurred
                    decentralization and experienced a surge of once-marginalized groups, yet most
                    have not consolidated their democratic institutions. In Bolivia, for example,
                    more than 500 indigenous mayors were elected in the past several years, during a
                    time of political fragmentation and economic crisis. Now there are 30 to 50
                    political parties where there used to be two or three. Where there's stark
                    poverty, where governments have been unable to improve people's standard of
                    living or meet basic needs, demagogues step in.</p>
                <p>The U.S. lost a great deal of moral authority within the last few years. The
                    xenophobic tone of our domestic debate on immigration generated more ill will.
                    But the desire for cooperation remains strong, and in areas like
                    counter-terrorism and cross-border law enforcement, our relationships have
                    strengthened.</p>

                        summary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>ROE: I came to the foreign service after many years of involvement in efforts to
                    advance free trade unions, human rights and natural resource protection. The
                    same valuerespect for the rights of others without borders - animated my years
                    with the State Department. No question, I would have been more comfortable
                    working with the exuberant band of eccentrics who flocked to the Office of
                    Strategic Services (OSS) in the 1940s than I was with the process-oriented
                    Foreign Service bureaucracy of the 1980s through the turn of the century.
                    Interpersonal diplomacy is, for me, the essence of representing our country. I
                    don't see it as limited to the diplomatic profession. Secretary of State
                    Condoleezza Rice called this work “transformational diplomacy.” But it's been
                    going on at least since post World War II days, when State Department officers,
                    labor activists and humanitarian experts went to workplaces and town halls and
                    refugee camps to help Europeans rebuild their civil society and political
                    institutions.</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>That perspective illuminated my career as a foreign service officer. My
                    assignments took me outside the office and the normal bureaucratic incubators. I
                    grabbed the opportunities that arose to work with people from all walks of life,
                    to learn from their situations and cooperate in removing walls of
                    misunderstanding and abuse. Some of these efforts came to nothing, but others
                    bore amazing fruit. One lesson I take away is that what counts most is not the
                    ideas you bring, but how you build relationships and give witness. The Spanish
                    language talks of “carino,” which means open-hearted, heartfelt. I learned that
                    the smallest, mindful efforts can strike a chord and have long-lasting
                    reverberations in people's lives. It happened in Bolivia during the trek to
                    rescue hostages at the Chicote Grande mine, during the labor blockades of La Paz
                    and the engagement with students of Siglo XX and Catavi.</p>
                <p>Pinochet's dirty war made me initially wary about taking an assignment in Chile.
                    Once there, I saw a new reality emerge as people made audacious choices that
                    turned history around. The ordinary citizens and emerging political and civic
                    leaders who spurred the democratic revolution showed me the human spirit at its
                    best. I was glad for the modest, improbable part I played in ensuring that the
                    1988 plebiscite was not stolen. The country's democratic leadership succeeded
                    beyond their expectations, building democracy and reconciliation out of decades
                    of suffering.</p>
                <p>In Israel I took on a sticky issue Histadrut-Palestinian dialoguand inched it
                    forward, in the space before the longest intifada. Citizens in the EU, Israel
                    and Colombia have lived with the threat of terror for decades. We have a lot to
                    learn from them. I remember seeing photos of John F. Kennedy in the homes of
                    Arab citizens, both Muslim and Christian, in Israel, very much like those you
                    see in small shops and altars in Hispanic America. They viewed the U.S. as the
                    champion of fair play and the rule of law. Most people in the Middle East are
                    more like us than not. They want a better life for their children. They want to
                    build, not destroy. The rhetoric of a clash of civilizations doesn't help us
                    understand Islamic fundamentalism. It rather helps the Bin Ladens and those like
                    Mugabe and Milosevic who invest in paranoia and ethnic hatred.</p>
                <p>Hungary taught me how effectively science and technology programs can promote the
                    values of open societies. I enjoyed traveling the back roads with scientists who
                    had few resources but big ideas about environmentally sustainable farming,
                    climate change action, species protection and subatomic particle collisions. I'm
                    convinced these ideas are wellsprings for the innovative, greener industries of
                    the future. With a tiny USAID investment and support from the REC, I helped
                    start a project for alternative wastewater treatment that cloned successfully in
                    Eastern and Southeastern Europe. During the debate over the Gabcikovo dam, I
                    refocused the Embassy on an environmental issue whose tentacles sprung from the
                    days of non-violent resistance to Communist rule.</p>
                <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                <p>Working on environmental assessment with respect to the Rio Grande bridges and
                    Bio Bio dams reminded me how closely woven are our foreign policy and domestic
                    issues. The settlement won through OPIC for struggling workers in Guatemala was
                    an advance, though it pales in comparison to the ongoing blacklist. I'm proudest
                    of my role in making the 2000 Stein OAS mission possible. That electoral
                    observation mission and the subsequent OAS dialogue in Lima helped open doors
                    for a host of other unforeseen developments, from a peaceful, democratic
                    revolution in Peru to the Inter-American Democratic Charter.</p>
                <p>It pains me to see how the foreign service was decimated in recent years. The
                    militarization of diplomacy; the slashing of development aid and of S&amp;T
                    programs; the disengagement from multilateral efforts to counter global warming
                    and prevent biological terrorism; the disestablishment of the U.S. Information
                    Agency; the gutting of verifiable, legally binding arms control agreements; the
                    detainee mistreatment in Guantanamo Bay; and effective non-recognition of the
                    Geneva convention — these policies harmed our standing and integrity. Ours is
                    the only country whose founding document calls for a “decent respect for the
                    opinions of mankind.” When the U.S. government strays from that core, everyone
                    loses.</p>
                <p>I see the pushback from federal courts and the rise in civic consciousness as
                    harbingers of a major shift. The Foreign Service has a lot to offer those who
                    want to serve our country and reinvigorate our international relations. The
                    bureaucracy is nothing easy, and the foreign assistance budget will in all
                    likelihood continue to be subject to severe pressures. But working abroad you
                    have a chance to develop more open systems. You meet people on an equal footing
                    in their language and culture. Those willing to take the dusty roads will find
                    exciting ways to engage with citizens and governments to strengthen our common
                    interests, advance global issues and make the planet a healthier, more equitable
                    place. Camus said it well: “If you walk beside me I may not choose to follow. If
                    you walk behind me I may not choose to lead. Walk beside me and we can be
                    friends.”</p>
