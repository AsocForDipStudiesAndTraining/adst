                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could give me a bit about your background,
                        when you were born, where you grew up, and a little about your education and
                        family, so people will have an idea of who you are.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Do you want my date of birth?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, date of birth, but also where, and then a bit about
                        growing up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Okay. I was born in 1923, in Beverly, Massachusetts, which is about
                    eighteen miles north of Boston, on the coast. Beverly in those days was a small
                    town. It's grown a bit since then. I grew up there and went to high school in
                    the only high school in Beverly, which is where we all attended high school.
                    Went on to Brown University for my undergraduate degree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you taking at Brown?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I sort of split majors between economics and political science. My
                    college career was interrupted by the war, fairly briefly. I was out for a
                    period of about a year, then came back and finished up, got my degree.</p>
                <p>Worked for a gentleman who is well known in the Foreign Service, Henry Merit
                    Wriston. After graduation, he appointed me to be his administrative assistant,
                    sort of a personal assistant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the president of Brown and later gained great
                        renown and became a verb.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: To Wristonize.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: On the personnel system of the...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On bringing the Civil Service and the Foreign Service
                        together, in the early Fifties.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were working for him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I was Class of '45, and that was before those days. He was very much
                    involved in foreign affairs in those days; a consultant in Washington, he would
                    spend a lot of his time in and out of Washington during the war and after the
                    war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a little about him, because he's, as I say,
                        a verb now in the Foreign Service. What was his background and how did he
                        operate, from your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: He came to Brown from [Lawrence University?], in Appleton, Wisconsin, and
                    he was at Brown for a number of years. I was tremendously impressed by his
                    intellect, as were, I think, most of the students. In those days, chapel was not
                    compulsory, but whenever it was known that he was going to speak, the place was
                    jammed with students, which is a pretty good sign that he spoke extremely well,
                    mostly on moral and foreign-policy issues of the day.</p>
                <p>Before graduation, I worked part time in the Admissions Office, helping the dean
                    of admissions with applications, putting files together and that sort of thing.
                    And then I sat on the Admissions Committee as sort of a student representative
                    on the Board of Admissions. From that and getting to know Dr. Wriston in that
                    position, just before graduation he asked me if I would like to work for him on
                    sort of a personal basis as a personal assistant, which I was honored to do.
                    Went down to his summer estate on the Cape and worked with him, essentially
                    helping with the research materials that he was involved in.</p>
                <p>I should also point out that he steered me toward the Fletcher School of Law and
                    Diplomacy, of which he was a member of the Board of Governors and was very
                    interested in it and steered me in that direction. And so, about six months
                    after graduation, I entered Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy and got my
                    master's degree there in international law, thanks largely to his influence.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>So I only worked for him for six months, but it was great fun and an interesting
                    period. This was long before he was involved with the Wriston Commission and all
                    that sort of thing, although he had tremendous interest in it. And he steered me
                    toward the idea of entering the Foreign Service. That's where the idea
                    germinated. I had not thought of the Foreign Service. I had thought of what one
                    thinks of, you know, something perhaps in the foreign-affairs field, maybe
                    business or maybe aid or something. But he steered me very much toward the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>So I took my Foreign Service exam actually while I was still at Fletcher. That
                    was in '46, one of the early exams after the war, when, every three months or
                    so, they were giving the Foreign Service exam. I took one of the early ones
                    while I was still a student, and passed, and they let me finish until I got my
                    master's degree. And then, a couple of days after getting that, I entered the
                    Foreign Service, in '46.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it work in '46 when you came in? In the first
                        place, how did they receive you and train you? Or did they do much in the
                        way of training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I took the written exam in '46, and shortly thereafter went down to
                    Washington for the oral exam, with a number of other people who had managed to
                    pass. I squeaked by in my written, as I recall, a few points over the floor that
                    was necessary. Then, I think the same day, they told us we were in or out. I was
                    in, and so I reported for duty very shortly thereafter.</p>
                <p>There were about twenty of us in a class of new FSOs. We had a three-month basic
                    course, which was in the old Lothrop House off Connecticut Avenue in those days,
                    not in the Department as such. That's where we met, and Perry Jester was our
                    mother confessor, the head of the class, as it were. We had the usual consular,
                    how to keep the books, some few words of protocol, and travel vouchers and all
                    that sort of thing, getting ready. And then most of us shipped out overseas upon
                    the conclusion of the three-month course. It was the summertime. Lothrop House
                    was not air conditioned. It was beastly hot, I remember that, and we sort of
                    suffered through the classes. I think we went out in about August or
                    September.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I went to Managua, Nicaragua.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where you served for what, about a year, year and a
                        half?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: A little over a year, a year and a half, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Managua?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Let's see. First post. Trying to learn what the Foreign Service was all
                    about. I had a wonderful boss, Ambassador Fletcher Warren.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the major figures.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Who was a wonderful first boss, I must say.</p>
                <p>I should mention that amongst the lectures that Perry Jester gave us was one word
                    of advice to all the young men in the course (I don't think there were any women
                    in the course in those days), that if any of us had any thoughts of getting
                    married and were planning to put it off, don't put it off. Get married before
                    going to your first post, because marriage at a post can cause all sorts of
                    problems and difficulties, or coming back here, and so on and so forth. So three
                    or four of us, I believe, got married shortly after the end of the course, as
                    did I.</p>
                <p>My wife was in Europe at the time, working for an organization. She got back one
                    week before I was due to go to Nicaragua. I had my orders. In those days, it was
                    extremely hard to travel, to get places on the airplanes and so forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because it was the immediate post-war period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, immediate post-war period, troops were coming home, transportation
                    was all very, very jammed up and hard to get. So she arrived in New York on a
                    ship after having great trouble getting home. She came home finally, I think, on
                    a Swedish ship, jammed on sort of a semi-freighter-type thing, because she kept
                    getting bumped. She had reservations to get home, but kept getting bumped for
                    troops, I suppose, or more important travelers. She was just a young person out
                    of Fletcher. I met her at Fletcher, by the way. This was her first job, and she
                    had attended a conference in Luxembourg about the post-war world or something of
                    that nature. So she got back one week before I had to leave.</p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>It was the Labor Day weekend, and we got married in New York City by going to a
                    Supreme Court judge, showing my official government orders, and getting a
                    waiver. This was the war period, and the judges were used to servicemen. I was
                    not exactly that, but I fit that pattern, and the judge was very nice and signed
                    the papers. It was all sort of a hazy rush, but I went here and there, and blood
                    tests and this and that, and getting the waiver and so forth, and finding a
                    minister. My wife is the daughter of a minister from the West Coast, but her
                    father had a friend in New York and so forth. We found the minister, and we got
                    married. She didn't come with me, obviously, right then; she went back to the
                    West Coast to see her family. But that was quite a hectic time, just, as I say,
                    a few days before taking off for Managua. So that was my introduction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Managua?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I think I did probably consular work at first, for a while. The
                    ambassador sort of moved me in different sections of the embassy, basically. I
                    think I did consular work, I think I did some economic work, and then went into
                    the Political Section, as I recall. Anyway, I think consular to begin with, as
                    was quite common, giving visas, American citizens, the whole consular range,
                    because this was a very small post. There must have been not more than ten
                    officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation in Nicaragua in those
                        days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, Somoza (the first), Tacho, was in control of things, very much in
                    control of things. We were, of course, fairly close to him, let's say. And
                    things were peaceful. There were always rumors of coups, and there were a number
                    of underground opposition groups. We tried, I think, to ameliorate the rigors of
                    the Tacho regime, let's say. But he had been a faithful friend during the war.
                    Although there was some disdain for him, I think, within the American community,
                    on the other hand, he was a friend. So it was just sort of a balancing act.</p>
                <p>He himself, although he has obviously a pretty notorious image, was personally a
                    very charming person, who loved parties and he loved dancing. If he would come
                    to a cocktail party, as he often would, near what would have been the end of the
                    cocktail party, he would suddenly summon his jazz band from the palace. And once
                    the jazz band arrived, that meant the party went on all night. In those days, no
                    diplomat could leave as long as the chief of state was present. So cocktail
                    parties often went on until two or three a.m., until he tired of dancing and
                    enjoying the party. This was a frequent occurrence. And so if you could get out
                    before, you could perhaps escape, but once the band arrived, he would say,
                    “Nobody's to leave. We're all here to have fun and dance.”</p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>So this was quite an introduction to the Foreign Service, to get to know the
                    chief of state, not too well, but meeting him at parties. He was a very, very
                    gregarious, open, friendly sort of person, and very friendly toward Americans.
                    And so one did get to parties at the palace, and he would come to diplomatic
                    parties, and stay, sometimes. Sometimes he would go off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we report on political events there? Here we were,
                        we were friendly to the...to Somoza.</hi>

                <p>HOLMES: The dictator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But from what I gather, there was some unrest. There must
                        have been some people who didn't think...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: There was some unrest. There were some opposition parties, legally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, obviously, you were at the lower level, but it was a
                        small embassy, did you feel under any constraints or problems? Because it's
                        usually the lot of the youngest political officer to take the opposition
                        under his wing and report more on them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I would say that it was a little more open than that, that the chief of
                    the Political Section, who was Maury Bernbaum, a career officer, later
                    ambassador to Ecuador and other places, would see opposition leaders. There was
                    a parliament and there was nominally an opposition party. So it was not a total
                    dictatorship, as in some countries that we all know since and before that time.
                    As part of our friendship, I think, we did lean on Somoza to maintain at least
                    some semblance of democracy. So one could see opposition leaders. And I remember
                    they used to come into the embassy, and I would escort them from the door up to
                    Maury's office, and then withdraw, perhaps as he discussed political things. So
                    we constantly reported on opposition groups. And there were a lot of not only
                    threatened coups, there were attempted coups from time to time.</p>
                <p>I can remember my home was in the center of the city. It was a
                    not-terribly-desirable location, but then I was brand new and I couldn't afford
                    to get out of it. Many of the Americans and foreigners lived out on the hills on
                    the outskirts of Managua. I was right in the center of town, near the main
                    military base, Campo Militar. From time to time, tanks would roll out of there,
                    and we'd say, “Uh oh, another coup.” And sometimes there was firing and shooting
                    around. We got to be quite accustomed to early morning tanks rolling by and
                    shots being fired. We would just stay put and it would usually be over in a day
                    or so.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>So all during my entire period, he was still there. When we left, he had not been
                    overthrown. But there were the usual threats and attempted coups and that sort
                    of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Fletcher Warren, a big figure in foreign affairs
                        in that period, operate his embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, just as a family, I would say. He was completely open. I found it
                    extremely heartwarming that he would treat me so well and give me all sorts of
                    advice, not just on how to report things. Maury Bernbaum was a superb draftsman,
                    and I learned an awful lot from him as far as the technical part when I was in
                    the Political Section under him. But Ambassador Warren trained me for the
                    Foreign Service as a whole, the Foreign Service life.</p>
                <p>I can remember when my wife and I both got malaria at one time, which was very,
                    very rampant there, he came down and sat in our bedroom and talked to us,
                    because we both felt pretty low, with a terrible case of malaria. He and his
                    wife came and sat with us a long time, in our not-very-desirable house. I mean,
                    he was that human. He was like an uncle or a favorite person in the family, you
                    know. Fantastic.</p>
                <p>It was a wonderful introduction to the Foreign Service, aside from the disease.
                    The illness there was in those days rampant. Our house, for instance, was
                    totally unscreened, and at night there would be swarms of mosquitoes from Lake
                    Managua, which was right there in the City of Managua, and we got malaria a
                    number of times. In fact, we were medevac-ed, finally. That's why I left early,
                    frankly, we were both pretty ill. They sent me down to Gorgas Hospital in
                    Panama, and the doctor said I should not go back to that place because I had had
                    repeated attacks of malaria and it had bothered my liver and stomach and so
                    forth. But that was not uncommon in those days. Now I think, since then, there
                    has been a tremendous improvement in living conditions. But this was right after
                    the war, and everything was scarce. Screening was scarce then. We had to import
                    food, I remember, at one... Some food was simply not obtainable there because of
                    the war. Basic things.</p>
                <p>So he was marvelous, and his wife. His wife was very, very nice to my wife and
                    trained her in the intricacies of calling on other ambassadors' wives. Of
                    course, my wife had no idea about all these protocol things. She was very
                    patient with...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, in 1947, you moved to Caracas.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Right, right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there? You were there from '47 to
                        '50.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, that was a regular three-year tour. That's when I transferred, when
                    the doctor said basically this officer should not go back to Nicaragua, which
                    was not uncommon either; a lot of people cut short their tours. And I remember
                    the ambassador even issued an edict: No families with children would be
                    permitted to come there, because there was so much disease and illness.</p>
                <p>It was like going to heaven, because Caracas is up in the mountains, it was cool,
                    flowers were blooming when we arrived there, all over the place. It was like a
                    reprieve.</p>
                <p>I mean, I liked Nicaragua, and the Nicaraguan people were terribly friendly. We
                    took Spanish lessons, and so we got into learning some Spanish and these
                    parties. And it was such a small community that we knew all the others. The
                    diplomatic community was very small and very closely knit. So from that
                    viewpoint, it was excellent. But the heat and the disease were sort of
                    overpowering, in a way. So Caracas was great.</p>
                <p>I went into the Consular Section, to begin with, for one year. The consulate was
                    separate in those days. It was headed by a consul general, but it was separate
                    from the embassy. So I was, in fact, under the consul general and worked in a
                    separate building, doing consular work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the main types of work you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I can't remember precisely. I think it was the full range of consular
                    duties, once again. It was and is still a small post. I think I did American
                    citizens, the protection, passports, visas, immigration, and MIDs, the
                    usual.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was still not the time of a lot of American
                        visitors.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, not really.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You weren't having Americans in jail and things like
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, no, just very rarely. I would have been the junior consular officer.
                    As I recall, there was one other officer. In fact, he was an American citizen
                    who had been out of the United States for something like thirty years, which was
                    in those days not uncommon. He had, I think, eight or ten children and couldn't
                    afford to get home leave, and was more like a Venezuelan than an American,
                    although technically he was an American citizen. It was one of those situations
                    that I don't think happens anymore. But he'd been there forever, and he was my
                    boss, you might say. And then there was a consul general, overall.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>I worked under him, as I recall, one year, and then the ambassador transferred my
                    into the Political Section of the embassy, which I was very happy about, really,
                    because the consular work was pretty much routine work. I had had a smattering
                    of it in Nicaragua, and I was keen, like most young officers, I think, to stay
                    in that political cone. We didn't have cones in those days, but I wanted to get
                    into the Political Section; that's what I really wanted. I'd had a taste of that
                    in Managua for about six months, as I recall, the last six months, I think. So I
                    was very glad. And so I moved over. Actually, at first I was in the ECON Section
                    for a while, and then, when an opening came in the Political Section, as the
                    ambassador had promised would happen and it did happen, I moved over to the
                    Political Section. That's what I wanted most of all.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political/economic situation in Venezuela in
                        this '47 to '50 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Once again, there was threats of coups and attempted coups rather
                    frequently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the system?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I think it was P�rez Jim�nez, as I recall, who came in while we were
                    there, or Aguelo, I've forgotten exactly. But there was a successful coup and
                    rather some bitter fighting. We had some escapades, as I remember. We were
                    playing cards one night in Caracas, and the tanks rolled by and machine gun fire
                    came right through the house. So we all dived under the card table and yanked
                    out the cord for the lamp. That particular coup was successful, and I think it
                    was Aguelo who came in (one forgets the names). ['35-'41 Eleazar Lopez Conteras,
                    president; '41-'45 Isaias Medina Angarita, president; Oct. '45-Dec. '47 R�mulo
                    Betancourt, headed civilian-military junta; Dec. '47-Nov. '48 R�mulo Gallegos,
                    president; Nov. '48 Lt. Col. Carlos Delgado Chalbaud and Maj. Marcos P�rez
                    Jim�nez, headed military junta; two years later Chalbaud was assassinated;
                    '51-'57 Jim�nez, dictator.] So there was a lot of political reporting to do at
                    that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude toward the situation there? Had it
                        been a coup from a democratically elected to a non-democratic, or was it

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: There had been a dictator in Venezuela for many years, dating way back,
                    and this coup successfully threw him out and changed regimes. So I think we were
                    very hopeful that it was a more encouraging democratic-type regime, some fresh
                    air, at least.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have the feeling that we were particularly

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>HOLMES: I have to say, really, I think if we were involved, it was on a level
                    that I perhaps didn't even know about myself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you didn't have the feeling that we were...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: We were not openly involved, certainly, no, no. No, I think restraint was
                    the general sort of rule, although we, in little ways, may have hoped that there
                    would be a change. I don't think we were directly involved, not in Nicaragua nor
                    in Venezuela, as far as I recall. I think, since that time, we've become more
                    involved in situations. But it was sort of hands off in those days, that's my
                    impression, other than giving student visas to people whom we thought were
                    perhaps the opposition groups, or their families were, and hoping to help spread
                    democracy in a very indirect and long-range type of way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the Venezuelans as far as the people you
                        would get to know in order to do your political or economic reporting?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Not quite as friendly as compared to Nicaragua, let's say, because there
                    were a lot of Americans in Venezuela. The oil companies were, of course, very
                    active in Venezuela, and as a result, as I recall, even when we were there,
                    there were ten thousand Americans in Caracas and the environs. And so I think
                    there were so many that the Venezuelans were turned off—just one more American.
                    Well, there were lots of Americans and lots of wealthy Americans, and they lived
                    in the country club set sort of thing, in a sense, more than we could afford as
                    a junior officer. These were well-paid oil executives. And so there was a whole
                    group of wealthy Americans who spoiled the market, in a sense. Whereas in
                    Nicaragua, there weren't many; there were very few Americans. There were a few
                    missionaries and a few businessmen and the embassy. So I think we were welcomed
                    as more of a curiosity. But, as I recall very strongly, Venezuelans were much
                    less interested in us. So it was harder to get into their homes, let's say, to
                    be entertained by them, to get to know them as friends. It was more difficult.
                    They were more standoffish, I think, as I recall our feelings. So from that
                    viewpoint, we weren't as happy, in a sense, although the whole ambiance, the
                    climate, the living conditions were much, much, much better than in
                    Nicaragua.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: I think so. This was a bigger post, and I didn't have at all the same
                    intimate relationship with the ambassador. I would see him at staff meetings;
                    occasionally we'd be invited to the residence. But it was a much larger post. My
                    feeling is that he was a very able career officer, but I didn't really know him
                    as I knew Ambassador Warren. It was quite a different situation. I was a junior
                    officer, after all, I'd only been in the Service a year and a half, one post, an
                    FSO Eight, I guess, unclassified C, right then maybe unclassified A or
                    something.</p>
                <p>My first salary, I remember very vividly, was $2,500 a year. That was my initial
                    salary in the Foreign Service. This was before the Foreign Service Act of
                    1946.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time, and really for not too long, a top salary in

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Was it that low, top salaries? I know mine was $2,500; I remember that
                    very vividly. And then the Foreign Service Act came into effect, and that raised
                    it a bit. Then there was a restructuring of the FSO grade system, and so it went
                    up. So it kept going up, but the first year or two... and we had college debts
                    to pay off.</p>
                <p>We didn't have an automobile at first. My first automobile was a surplus Jeep
                    that we got from Panama. The Army declared a whole lot of Jeeps surplus at the
                    end of the war. I arrived down there on the air attach�'s plane and picked out
                    this Jeep, and I think it was $200, as I recall. We somehow got it back to
                    Nicaragua, and it was our first car. We were delighted to have wheels, because
                    originally we had to depend on friends to take us to parties; weekends to get
                    out of town, always with a friend, and that was not an ideal situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you left Caracas, you were getting a little
                        bit seasoned in the Foreign Service. You left in 1950 and you went to a
                        place that must have been quite a change.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: A big change.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Tel Aviv, where you served for about two, two
                        and a half years or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes. That was sort of exciting. As in those days, one day a cable came
                    that said: You will report to Tel Aviv within ten days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good God!</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>HOLMES: First of all, we had to look it up—quick, get an atlas, where is Tel
                    Aviv? It was our first embassy in Tel Aviv and they were desperately desiring to
                    staff the embassy. And I think they had had an illness or something and had lost
                    an officer. This was, as I say, the initial embassy. Ambassador McDonald, who
                    was a very prominent friend of Truman. Truman named him as our first ambassador.
                    He was very pro-Jewish. He had been active in the American-Jewish community
                    funds and organization. He was not a Jew himself, but a very well-known
                    pro-Jewish person and a personal friend of Truman. So he opened our first
                    embassy, and he had priority, I guess, in getting people wherever he needed
                    them. And somehow or other, he chose me and said, “In ten days.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how does one get there? In 1950, it couldn't have
                        been easy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: It was very, very interesting, we managed to get aboard a ship. It was an
                    Italian ship that was going from La Guaira, the port of Caracas, to Milan, and
                    it was sailing very soon, very, very soon. Of course, it was totally booked up,
                    but through some friends and so forth, an agent and whatnot, we managed to get
                    the doctor's cabin. The doctor moved out. The shipping line would do this
                    sometimes, if people would pay the price. The U.S. government in those days,
                    since I had these urgent orders, paid to install us in the doctor's cabin. I
                    should mention, we had a three-month-old baby at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, ho!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: So it was quite a hectic time getting ready, getting the ship, going down
                    to La Guaira, getting on. Now the cabin itself was luxurious; it was the
                    doctor's cabin and it was quite spacious. And that was fun. The crew was
                    wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, an Italian crew with a baby, I can't think of a nicer
                        combination. Italians love babies.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, so they would babysit for us while we went to dinner or lunch and so
                    forth. And if we wanted to swim in the pool, they would watch the baby with us
                    and so forth. But my wife was not terribly keen on this sort of travel, to the
                    unknown Middle East with a three-month-old child, our first child. But we did
                    it, as one did in those days. There was no question. We got this telegram saying
                    we're going, and we went.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation when you arrived in Tel Aviv? Give
                        a little feel for how you saw the situation in Israel. In the first place,
                        we recognized Israel in 1948, didn't we?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, we were the first country in the world to recognize the new state.
                    When we went there in '50, the embassy had been there for about a year. We had
                    to change ships, of course, in Milan, and got a small ship that sailed down to
                    Tel Aviv. And the first thing we did was have to pass the baby, in a basket,
                    over the side, lower it down into a boat, because Tel Aviv was not a real port;
                    it was used only by lighters. So the baby went down, and then we went down the
                    side on a rope ladder sort of thing, down into this lighter, with a few
                    suitcases, and they took us into Tel Aviv. That was our introduction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, boy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, it was a very exciting situation. Israel was still at war with its
                    neighbors. Of course, it still is, even today, technically. But it actively was,
                    then. There were blackouts every night. There were sandbags around all the
                    entrances to buildings, public buildings and apartment houses. And so, if you
                    went to a party at night, you went in the pitch black, and you'd feel your way
                    around the sandbags to find the door and then get in. It was total blackout
                    until you'd get to someone's apartment, and then there would be lights there,
                    the windows all sealed. So we lived in sort of blackout conditions, which was
                    very exciting, in a way. Now there were no air raids, there was nothing of that
                    sort. But the Israeli government, of course, was not at all certain there
                    wouldn't be. With good reason, because it had been a very tough war of
                    independence, and their independence was precarious. So the blackout was rigidly
                    enforced. When we would drive at night, we had little slits in the headlights,
                    just tiny, tiny little slits, the absolute minimum of light. So that was sort of
                    exciting after South America, very, very different...</p>
                <p>But it was a very exciting time. The people of Israel were extremely friendly.
                    The people that we dealt with in the Foreign Office were extremely
                    well-educated, highly intelligent, proficient people to deal with. I mean, these
                    were refugees from Germany, Poland, Hungary, or wherever, who had come to the
                    new state. They were the elite, obviously, the intellectual elite who were in
                    the Foreign Office. That was under Ben Gurion, who was the prime minister. Moshe
                    Sharett was the foreign minister, who spoke seven languages and at a reception
                    could flip from one language to another just effortlessly in the receiving line.
                    I was always impressed that he would jump from German to Hungarian to, of
                    course, Hebrew, to French to English. A brilliant, brilliant man. So the quality
                    of the government was incredibly high, and I was struck by that, I must say. Not
                    drawing any invidious comparisons, but it was a type of brilliance that you
                    rarely see in a government, all the way down through the Foreign Office, even to
                    the more junior people. So that was interesting, and the whole situation was
                    interesting.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>While we were there, we traveled all over the country, with the assistance of the
                    government. We had to go in convoys to the outlying areas; it was not wise to go
                    on your own. We went to the Hula swamps up north that they were draining in
                    those days, Stu, for agricultural purposes. They were channeling it into the
                    Jordan River, draining the swamps. That was a big project. Took us all the way
                    down through the Negev to the south. We'd drive cheek by jowl with Arab troops
                    with machine guns, right along the border. It's a very narrow border, and the
                    road goes right along the border.</p>
                <p>We could get to Jerusalem once a month, the old city of Jerusalem. Jerusalem was
                    a divided city, with barbed wire right down through the city. We could get to
                    the other side through arrangements with our consulate general in Jerusalem.
                    That is, they had to get permission from the Jordan government, and they would
                    give us a certain time to cross the border, like a Friday afternoon. That was
                    the typical time; you could go for a weekend. Then we would drive up through
                    no-man's-land in Jerusalem. There was a little opening in the barbed wire,
                    through this no-man's-land, which we were warned was heavily mined on both
                    sides. So we'd stick to just the track. We'd drive along there, and as we
                    approached, the Arab Legion, which was the Jordan army, would have machine guns
                    trained on us all the time as we went along through no-man's-land. Then we'd get
                    to their post, where they often spoke no English. They would have a list of
                    border passings for that particular time frame, and it was all in Arabic. So the
                    Arab officer would look at this list, and we would present our passports, and if
                    he could find something in Arabic that sort of corresponded to Holmes, he'd let
                    us through. If he couldn't, you couldn't get through. There was no way if your
                    name was not on the list. That was the list that was arranged through, as I say,
                    the Jordan Foreign Office, which would send it to the military people and so
                    forth. So, once a month, we did try to get over, basically to buy food. We had
                    the one baby, and food was extraordinarily scarce in Israel; there was very
                    strict rationing. Sometimes a half a can of peas, for instance, would be a
                    ration. You'd go and you'd bring a jar with you, and they'd pour half a can of
                    peas and take your little ration ticket. So it was very rational, and they were
                    spreading out the food they did have to feed the population. But it was hard,
                    with a new child, to get the types of food that we particularly wanted. And so,
                    once a month, we'd go over and load up with food. We could bring food back;
                    neither side cared if we did that. They would inspect it. We would buy for lots
                    of other people, always, lots of meat and vegetables and milk and just
                    everything, and bring it back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job in Tel Aviv?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I was supposed to be in the Political Section, but when I got there,
                    though, there was a need for me to be in the consulate. So I was in charge of
                    the consulate, which was very, very busy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Those were the days of American citizens who had been over fighting for
                    the new State of Israel during the independence war and now wanted to go home,
                    and the question was, had they lost their citizenship? Our citizenship laws were
                    quite strict: if you enrolled in a foreign army and took an oath of allegiance,
                    you jeopardized your American citizenship. So we had lots of those cases that
                    were handed to me, I remember, to deal with. There were all sorts of things, but
                    the big problem there was American citizens of Jewish faith and the question of
                    their citizenship. A lot had come over to help the new State of Israel, and a
                    lot had voted in the first election. Now voting in those days was enough to make
                    you lose citizenship. Well, not exactly, it was sort of a grey area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it was very complicated.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: It was complicated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But essentially voting, service in a foreign military, and
                        an oath of allegiance all could jeopardize your citizenship. And we enforced
                        it in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: We did enforce it. We tried to enforce it. But I used to get lawyers in
                    and argue with me the fine points of American law and decisions, and already the
                    law was beginning to change a little bit. It's changed a lot since then, I
                    believe, but in those days, we were told by the State Department to enforce the
                    law, basically. But then the question was: did a young man take the oath of
                    allegiance? Because the State of Israel permitted people to be in the army
                    without an oath of allegiance, knowing our immigration law. So the question was:
                    did he or didn't he take an oath of allegiance? Well, that's rather hard to
                    prove. There were certain lists available. So my time essentially was taken up
                    with the whole question of American citizenship problems. I don't think I did
                    much with visas at all; I think there was some other officer that handled visas.
                    So it was sort of interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I'm sure. Speaking as a veteran consular officer, I
                        can imagine what you must have been up against. Later it became very
                        powerful, but did you find there was what one could call a Jewish lobby in
                        Congress that was giving you a great deal of trouble on taking away
                        citizenship from these freedom fighters or whatever you want to call
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, indeed. Yes, indeed. There was a very powerful lobby in Washington,
                    and it affected us in many, many ways.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Ambassador McDonald, you may know, was not very au courant with the State
                    Department. His line of command was President Truman. And he would pick up the
                    phone, frequently, and talk to President Truman whenever he wanted certain
                    instructions. And within a few hours, we'd get the instructions that he wanted,
                    which he had arranged with President Truman. He had that close in. In those
                    days, the State Department was torn on the whole Israeli policy. There were many
                    who said we shouldn't have recognized the new state; we did it prematurely,
                    allegedly, by certain elements within the State Department. It was alleged that
                    the Middle East Division was pro-Arab, anti-Jewish. So it was a very interesting
                    political problem. As I say, Ambassador McDonald was a very able person, and he
                    utilized his friendship with President Truman very much and, in a sense, would
                    circumvent the State Department if he felt that it was important. He was very
                    desirous to help the new State of Israel progress in as many ways as possible,
                    with our AID program (it wasn't called AID in those days; Point Four, I think it
                    was called) and different things to assist the new state get its feet on the
                    ground and develop. He was very interested in Israel as a functioning entity, a
                    new state, and did everything he could to help the new state develop.</p>

                        approach was, you've got a lot of Arab countries, and you've got one small
                        country that's going to be a thorn in the side. And now, forty-odd years
                        later, it's still a thorn in the side and causing all sorts of trouble.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: And you had a president who was pro-Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A president who was way ahead of his Department of State
                        on this. Now here you are, an officer coming in with no particular
                        commitment one way or another—you're not an Arabist, you're not of the
                        Jewish faith, you've come out of Latin America. I think it's important to
                        get a feel. How did you feel, as an officer there? Israel was a dynamic
                        place. Did you get caught up in this? And not just you, but the others
                        around you. And did you feel that maybe your colleagues in Egypt or in
                        Jordan or in Syria were almost kind of the enemy? What was your feeling when
                        you got into that situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I think you summarized it very well. First of all, the ambassador,
                    McDonald, made it very clear that if people didn't agree with his mission, they
                    might as well leave.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was really a mission in those days.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: In his view, it was a mission, in that he was placed there by the
                    president to carry out certain functions. In his view, it was to help Israel,
                    okay? In those days, we had no military assistance or anything like that, but it
                    was to assist the new state. That was his mission and his function, and he made
                    it clear that's what he expected his staff to do. Once again, it was a small
                    embassy, quite small. It was a new embassy, and there were very, very difficult
                    living conditions. We lived in a beauty parlor, I remember that, amongst all the
                    dryers and blowers and things. That's where we lived because we couldn't find
                    anyplace else at first. We lived there six months, in a beauty parlor, with a
                    new baby, in amongst all this machinery.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What had happened to the owner?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: The lady was a Hungarian, and she had gone back to Hungary for a while,
                    for a long holiday. We were extremely fortunate, because up to then, we had to
                    live with members of the staff in their homes until we found this thing. She was
                    a hairdresser and went back to Hungary for a long visit, and said we could live
                    there until she came back. So that's where we lived; it was tough living.</p>
                <p>But I think the morale was high in the embassy. I think people absorbed this
                    mission idea. It was an exciting place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, of course it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>HOLMES: The Israelis were doing all sorts of things. I mentioned the draining of
                    the Hula swamps. Well, that was a tremendous project, but it was progressing.
                    And they were doing all sorts of forestation work, and they were putting in
                    irrigation, and they were having tremendous groves of trees and agricultural
                    development, which was happening. You know, they didn't just talk about it, they
                    did it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a natural affinity to the American can-do
                        feeling.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes. They were dedicated people, and they were brilliant people, working
                    hard. And, of course, they had all the kibbutzim movement, which we used to be
                    invited to visit and see. The spirit was tremendous amongst the Israeli people,
                    and I think the embassy absorbed that spirit. As I say, if somebody was anti,
                    then I think he would not stay. I mean, I think the ambassador would suggest
                    that perhaps he should move on.</p>
                <p>In a sense, the ambassador was fighting about five other ambassadors in the
                    surrounding countries. But he was an able fighter, and he wrote very well, and
                    the backing of Mr. Truman in the White House sort of helped his hand. But it was
                    a constant battle, in a sense, because some of the other nearby embassies didn't
                    care much for Israel, and they would see it from their viewpoint.</p>
                <p>There were frequent border incidents, the usual things, stealing sheep across the
                    border, and incidents at night where there would be some firing on the border,
                    and who fired the first shot? God, you know.</p>
                <p>We were trying to assist Israel by bringing peace with Jordan, and we were
                    dealing with Abdullah, the king of Jordan. Through secret negotiations, we did
                    manage to have negotiations take place, secretly, across the border in Israel
                    and in Jordan, by emissaries of Ben-Gurion and the king. I don't think they ever
                    met, themselves, but their emissaries did. We were knee-deep in this, and this
                    was a major desire of U.S. foreign policy, to bring peace with one of the
                    countries. The feeling was that if they could get it with one country, then
                    maybe you would start the process with other Arab countries, to bring peace.
                    This was building up to a very hopeful point, when Abdullah was assassinated,
                    which ended that possibility for the time being.</p>
                <p>But that is what Ambassador McDonald was involved in...I shouldn't say full time,
                    but a large portion of his time was involved in it. He personally with
                    Ben-Gurion, and our ambassador on the other side, trying to do this. So I don't
                    think people would fight that sort of thing; both sides were agreeable. That is,
                    our embassy in Amman. I think we were both trying to get this to happen. That
                    is, we weren't dictating the terms, but we hoped that if they would negotiate,
                    maybe they could draw a border and establish relationships.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>It made enormous sense from all sides, if they could get over the war period and
                    have a period of cooperation. Israel had, as I mentioned, brains and ability for
                    development, and they could help the other side very much. And they needed food;
                    they would buy the produce of Jordan. So, economically it made a lot of sense.
                    And then the Jordan River could have been used both intelligently and in a very
                    good way, by both sides, in irrigation schemes. Elaborate schemes were developed
                    by us and consultants and so forth, with the idea of helping both sides. It
                    didn't come to happen; Abdullah was assassinated. I think it was Abdullah.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was Abdullah. He was the grandfather of King Hussein. I
                        think the crown prince was not right mentally or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, he was dealing, he was dealing, and they were gradually coming to
                    the point where they might have achieved a peace agreement. The entire time I
                    was there, that was our number-one objective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in the Consular Section all the time there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, no. No, just at first. Once again there was that situation where
                    there was a sudden need for me in the Consular Section. And so, when somebody
                    else arrived, in x months, then I moved over to the Political Section. That's
                    what I was slated to do originally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because it was a small embassy, can you remember who the
                        DCM and who the chief of the Political Section were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: [chuckle]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we can fill this in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I remember Milton Freen was the labor attach�. He was very, very active
                    in the Political Section. It was of course the Labor government there, his side
                    was government, and he was a very able labor attach�. He was the son-in-law of a
                    very prominent American labor leader. When I was in the Political Section, he
                    and I worked very, very closely together; he was labor attach�, I was political
                    officer. I was the only political officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you deal with the Israeli government? What did you
                        do in order to report?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, all the usual functions.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But remember, I'm looking for somebody who is not familiar
                        with how it works. What are the usual things that you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, a lot of dealings with the Foreign Office on whatever, all the
                    minutiae, let's say, of relationships. Now there we had a lot of visitors. The
                    ambassador told me he wanted visitors to be handled properly, and, as the
                    political officer, my function was to be sort of in charge of visitors. And by
                    visitors, I mean congressmen, prominent businessmen, journalists, a lot of
                    political people. A lot of senators and congressmen come to Israel in great
                    numbers, or they did in those days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They still do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Still do, I'm sure. So I had to do a lot of the arranging of their
                    schedules. And this took a lot of liaison with the Foreign Office, to be sure.
                    And the Foreign Office was very good about it; they wanted these people to have
                    a good view of Israel. And so this meant arranging for transportation, programs,
                    visitations, where to go and when and so forth. These visitors wanted to see the
                    kibbutzim; they wanted to see the countryside; they wanted to see this, that,
                    and the other thing. And Israel was keen for them to do it. But we were
                    operating under difficult conditions. They couldn't go some places because it
                    was unsafe, so they would have to go with convoys. That meant liaison with the
                    army to arrange protection for them. So that took a lot of time, as well as
                    reporting.</p>
                <p>Now we didn't have any threat of coups, as in Latin America, none of that sort of
                    thing, but there were opposition parties. There was the Herut Party, which
                    subsequently has become the government, but in those days was the opposition. It
                    was headed by a well-known terrorist who had been involved in the King David
                    situation, Menachem Begin. He was a member of parliament.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you view him, as somebody sort of basically... You
                        just put both of your thumbs down. He was sort of a scary figure, wasn't
                        he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, he was a well-known terrorist, there was just no doubt about it,
                    and he was an extremist, whose speeches were...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Shamir had been involved with an assassination.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Shamir, oh yeah. But I don't remember Shamir, I remember Begin. Begin was
                    the head of the Herut Party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later became the Likud Party.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, Likud is an umbrella organization, I believe, Herut and some
                    others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But basically Begin was the...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: He was the powerhouse. He was a brilliant guy. I did meet him, and he was
                    very impressive, in a sense. I mean, mentally he was a very powerful guy. Of
                    course, he was a young man in those days. One never thought he would ever become
                    prime minister, I don't think, in those days. It didn't seem possible. The Labor
                    government was well ensconced, well run, and it had all sorts of, of course,
                    connections with the Histadrut, which is the federation of the labor
                    organizations.</p>
                <p>But we reported on all these things, the currents of the opposition party,
                    debates in parliament, the politics of the country, which were very interesting
                    and very intricate; they were not easy. You had the religious parties, which
                    were allied with Ben-Gurion. Ben-Gurion was Labor, but if he got a certain
                    number of votes, he was allied with the ultra-religious parties. And they had
                    their own agenda. So we very much had to report on what their agenda was, their
                    outlook. It was a very busy political time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure it was. Did you feel any constraints, which came
                        later, maybe, that whatever you reported would immediately end up on the
                        desks of either the Jewish lobby or the senators from New York or California
                        who had large Jewish constituencies? This later became quite a problem. I
                        was wondering if it was at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I don't recall such constraints. A lot of it was setting the framework of
                    a new government. It was a new country, so the State Department wanted
                    information and information galore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were just scooping up information.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes. What is the Teachers' Union, for instance, and how does it fit into
                    the picture? Sometimes there were little strikes of different groups, so how
                    does that fit? Why were they striking? The doctors went on strike at one point.
                    Why? What is their political influence? Each group had influence, in a way. I
                    never could do enough reporting; I always felt there was more I would like to
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like a young political officer's dream. Here you
                        were, in a new nation which was obviously on the front burner as far as
                        American foreign policy. You were in on the ground floor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: It was very exciting. It was an exciting time to be there. There was an
                    enormous amount of enthusiasm in the country, and idealism. For the first time
                    in hundreds and hundreds of years, the Israelis had their own state, and they
                    were excited about it. A lot of the people we met were out of concentration
                    camps, escapees from the horrors of the holocaust. They had lost their whole
                    family, many of them, and they were the only surviving member. But they were
                    there in Israel, and they were totally dedicated to helping develop this new
                    state. Tremendous idealism and enthusiasm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went over to Jerusalem, did you talk to our
                        officers at our consulate general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Not really. No, I didn't go over in a political mission at all. It was a
                    food mission, plus tourism. We saw all the holy places, which was wonderful to
                    be able to visit and to walk through the streets of Jerusalem, with no
                    automobiles, you just walk through, as well as buying a few rugs and being a
                    tourist, basically. Well, I met some of our people over there; they would invite
                    us sometimes. But it was a constant flow. They knew we came over to shop,
                    basically, and to be a tourist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your wife find this? I can understand her
                        traumatic arrival and having to live with the hair dryers and all that. How
                        did this work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, it was tough. It was tough, particularly with a young child and the
                    lack of food. I remember we had cases of baby food under the bed. We finally
                    found a small apartment and managed, one way or another, frankly, by paying in
                    U.S. dollars, the only way we could possibly get it, which was illegal under our
                    regulations at the time. (I don't know if I should leave that in or not.) There
                    was just no other way. There was no other way. We got an apartment, which was
                    very hard to get; housing was just incredible. So we moved out of the beauty
                    parlor into an apartment, and that was nice. Well, it was one bedroom, but we
                    felt ourselves fortunate, because it was on the ground floor and had a nice
                    terrace, so the baby, a boy, could be out on the terrace, which was fine. It was
                    right on a busy street, but the terrace had grillwork, so the baby could be out
                    there and sort of watch the passersby, who would speak to him. The Israelis love
                    children. So we felt, you know, this was wonderful. But it was tough, the whole
                    thing of buying food three months in advance.</p>
                <p>And then, too, it was just an awfully embarrassing thing that we would have food
                    for the children, and the other people in the apartment, whom my wife got to
                    know, didn't have food. We were told we can't possibly share it. Well, we did
                    share it a bit, because sometimes a woman would come down, weeping, and just
                    say, “I have nothing to feed Yanni,” who was the little boy who played with our
                    little boy, you know, just little toddlers. And so, obviously... Under our bed
                    were just cases of stuff, so we would share it to some extent, when we weren't
                    supposed to. There were lots of things you weren't supposed to do, but frankly,
                    I think the ambassador said, “You've got to live here.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've all gone through that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: We'd get paid in dollars, and through a New York bank account, we'd send
                    a check or something. What the heck. I mean, I don't think it was too illegal.
                    But we felt it because the ambassador would say, “These are the regulations.” On
                    the other hand, he tended to look a little bit the other way—he didn't ask. In
                    those days, the embassy didn't help get a place. You found your own place; you
                    went out and knocked on doors to find someplace to live. The apartment we found
                    was owned by a prominent actor in the Hadassah Theater there (I think it was
                    called Hadassah). He was going to live in it himself, but he liked the idea of
                    some dollars that would permit him, then, to visit the U.S. and so forth, which
                    he wanted to do, so we got the apartment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any dealings with any of the people who were
                        in the leadership, particularly of the Labor Party?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Just the same as the government: outstanding people, devoted, able. The
                    whole labor system is extremely interesting. It was a labor government, after
                    all, and the labor unions controlled an awful lot of companies; the construction
                    companies and so forth were owned by the labor union. It was fascinating, just
                    to learn this. Once again, there was this voracious appetite back in Washington
                    for reporting on what things are; they wanted information on this brand new
                    state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There weren't really real policy divisions from a...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, there were, there were battles. There was a leftist Mapam Party,
                    which was to the left of Mapai. Mapai was the government. They were both labor,
                    but there was a split in the labor movement. They were more leftist than what we
                    would call middle-of-the-road. Socialist, but the others were more left. They
                    weren't Communist, but they were more left wing.</p>
                <p>So it was reporting on all these things, on all these currents, and then the
                    defections. One would defect from that group to this group. There were
                    maneuvers. It was a fascinating political scene, more than I could ever report.
                    I just felt I had to report some of the highlights, but there were so many
                    things I'd have liked to report more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the American labor movement, the AFL/CIO, intrude much
                        into what was going on, sort of getting involved on one side or the
                        other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: They were very, very close to the Histadrut, the Mapai Party. Each of the
                    parties had its own cohorts in the United States, its own supporting elements
                    and groups. For instance, the extreme religious parties had strong religious
                    groups back here, fundamentalists, I guess you might call them, Jewish groups.
                    So each had its supporters.</p>
                <p>Basically we reported; we were not involved in any way. We dealt with the
                    government, which was Mapai, the centrist group, Socialist. We dealt with the
                    government, that's all. And we were right up to our necks. Busy. Busy, busy. It
                    was a busy, busy place.</p>
                <p>And these visitors took an enormous amount of time. The ambassador had told me,
                    “This is just as important as anything else. Be sure that the visitors get to
                    see what they want to see and meet the people they want to meet.” He's probably
                    right—it was politically very important, but when a senatorial delegation came,
                    they...</p>
                <p>One great visitor we had was Mrs. Roosevelt. I was assigned to be her liaison
                    officer. Of course, they loved her in the country, they knew her. We had this
                    wonderful two-week tour of the whole country, and I went along as her
                    aide-de-camp, you might say.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you find her?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Absolutely fantastic. One of the most interesting, vibrant women I've
                    ever met in my life. I've never seen such energy—from morning till night,
                    energy. This meant orphanages, hospitals, schools, politicos—all day long, this
                    was scheduled. The Israelis had one fault: they would tend to over schedule
                    visitors, because they wanted them to see everything, and they'd put too much
                    in. And she was not a young lady when she came. She was at the U.N. in those
                    days. She came with a doctor, a young man who was her doctor, and he would be
                    flaked out in the afternoon; he was exhausted. I was exhausted; everyone was.
                    But she would go on. Incredible energy. And vibrancy. And wonderful warmth. I
                    think it was her first visit there, and she wanted to see everything. She kept
                    up with the schedule, even, which meant every half hour another group, with more
                    flowers, more speeches, more little talks. And she just carried it off
                    brilliantly. A fascinating woman. And then, in the evening, she would talk to us
                    about her early days with Franklin, and the polio, just as though we were
                    longtime friends. She had incredible warmth. Outstanding woman.</p>
                <p>That's just one visitor. We had Senator This and Senator That. Congressman
                    Powell, I remember, came.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Adam Clayton Powell.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: That was difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was very controversial. In the first place, he was a
                        black congressman at a time when there weren't many black congressmen. And
                        he had a reputation as being a ladies' man, very much, but at the same time
                        he was, I suppose today you might say, in your face, or more confrontational
                        than was considered prudent in a still-segregated United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, there, he wasn't confrontational. He came simply to visit, the way
                    so many did. But he was very demanding, let's say, demanding on embassy
                    resources, which were limited. It was a small embassy. I'm sure now it's huge by
                    comparison. But it was small, and we just didn't have a lot of things. But he
                    was very demanding in transportation and arrangements and so forth. I remember
                    it was a very difficult visit.</p>
                <p>But not the only difficult one that we had; a lot of our senators and congressmen
                    are rather demanding overseas. If you're at a big post, it can be handled. But
                    at a small post, it's more difficult; we don't have the resources, we don't have
                    Scotch whiskey, necessarily.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the beginning of the coldest period of the Cold
                        War. The Korean War had started; NATO was being formed. Did you feel any
                        winds coming out of Siberia? Did Communism and the Cold War intrude much
                        then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I don't think, at all. As I remember, we were totally bound up in
                    relations between the United States and Israel. The big push was to help Israel
                    achieve peace with its neighbor across the Jordan River. That was our focus. I
                    don't recall the other things at all; they just didn't enter into the picture.
                    It was a question of Israel vis-�-vis its Arab neighbors, and Israel needing
                    development assistance, which we were giving in different ways, and wanting to
                    help Israel develop as a new country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the discussions that you would have, sitting around a
                        small embassy, how about arms for Israel? Because in those days, what the
                        Israelis were getting was mainly coming from the French, I suppose, wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I don't recall that being in the picture. The war was over, in a sense,
                    though one didn't know. After all, looking back now, we can say, well, there was
                    no real threat. But the Israelis thought there was a real threat of renewed
                    warfare with its neighbors. And there were incidents on the border from time to
                    time, trucks being blown up occasionally, you know. So it was scary. They had
                    just gone through a very difficult war of independence, with a lot of people
                    killed, and it was touch-and-go for a while. They were fortunate enough to carve
                    out a certain area. But I don't recall their needing more arms, or asking us for
                    arms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So that wasn't an issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, I think that came later on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left there in 1952. Did you have an idea of what
                        you wanted to do, or were you still letting the Service decide?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I applied for a year's university training. I thought that seemed
                    like a good idea. Actually, that was in labor economics at the University of
                    Wisconsin. I guess I was influenced by my involvement in the labor situation
                    there, and with our labor attach�, who was a very outstanding man.</p>

                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Right, right, Perleman was his name.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But many other people, like Sam Berger, came out of that
                        particular environment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I think, in a sense, I welcomed the break for a year. I'd worked very
                    hard in Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure you had.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: It was very, very hard work. At the end of two years, I was glad to think
                    of maybe a year in a university. The opening developed, the possibility came,
                    and so I took it. So we went to Wisconsin for a year, graduate work in labor
                    economics, which was a very interesting year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In labor economics, what were you getting at that period
                        of time, '52, '53ish? What was the thrust of labor economics? Whither labor?
                        And how were people in the academic world seeing this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, Wisconsin, of course, was, as you said, a center, really, of labor
                    academics. There were a number of outstanding professors, among whom was
                    Professor Witty, who had been in the Social Security Administration at one time.
                    And I just enjoyed absorbing the whole question of social legislation, labor
                    economics, that type of thing. It was an eye-opener; I didn't know much about
                    this sort of thing. I'd had bits of it in college, but not extensively, as one
                    got there. So it was a wonderful year, a year away from the stress and strains
                    of cables, just absorbing these seminars. In the graduate school, one got to
                    know the professors; there weren't huge classes, there were small classes. Some
                    were bigger, but some were small. So it was great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After you left labor training, was there an effort to turn
                        you into a labor attach�?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I was called a labor-reporting officer, as a result of that training, not
                    really labor attach�.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but it was still a labor officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, and I was going to combine that with political reporting, as I had
                    done in Israel. That was what had steered me in that direction, because in
                    Israel in those days, politics and labor were all intertwined, the whole thing.
                    That's, I think, why I got so interested in labor as a political and social
                    force in a country, and that's why I studied that.</p>

                <p>Then I was back in the Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For about a year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, yes, a subject that was rather painful. Those were the days when
                    McCarthy was riding high, McCarthy and his minions. He had a particular minion
                    right in the State Department, Scott McLeod, who thought that I was probably a
                    security risk, and prevented my being assigned overseas, as I wanted to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: It's very complex, and I don't know if I want to go into it all here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: My wife's father was a minister and had been a Socialist, as part of his
                    approach to Christianity, and had visited Russia at one time with a group. And
                    because of that, I was suspended.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good God.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: And I had to prove that I was not a threat to the U.S. government, or my
                    wife. And that took about a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, my.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, you know, in those days, I was not alone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I know you weren't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: It was not a very happy period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To catch a little of this, you know, I don't want to
                        pry.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>HOLMES: And then, also, I had come out of labor training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, I was going to say. But just to catch a little
                        bit, how did you feel, at the time, that the Department treated you? Here
                        you were, under fire.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I felt that they gave me no support whatsoever, that they threw me to the
                    wolves. They indicated that if I would like to leave, that was the time to leave
                    the Service. I spent a good bit of that time in New York looking for a job
                    elsewhere, with private business, which I didn't really want to do. It was the
                    lowest period of my whole career. The Department didn't give me any support.
                    They just said, “You satisfy Mr. McLeod that you're okay, and then we'll think
                    about...” I was suspended; I was thrown out for a while.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the security people treat you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Awful. Awful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did they do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Questioned me at length about my father-in-law, whom I barely knew. We
                    had met. I told you how were married; I'd never met him when I got married. I
                    met her at Fletcher, she went to Europe, she came back, and we got married here.
                    I'd never been to my wife's home. On home leave from Caracas, I met him for the
                    first time. But, anyway, it was questioning, questioning, questioning about my
                    father-in-law, whom I had met briefly. He was a minister of the
                    gospel—admittedly a liberal minister of the gospel—and believed in helping
                    people with cooperative movements, things nowadays which are so...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, I'm trying to capture a bit. I don't want to dwell
                        on something that's painful to you, but I still think it's important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I was thrown to the wolves.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were these security people like?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>HOLMES: No understanding whatsoever of such things. They were dumb flatfoots,
                    under McLeod, but they were extremely powerful in the Department. I think the
                    Department was scared to death of them and of McCarthy. McCarthy was making
                    charges, of course, of Communists in the State Department, and homosexuals or
                    things of that nature. The Department was permeated with fear in those days. I
                    had been overseas in Israel, then I had been in Wisconsin, so I was out of the
                    stream. Then I ended my one year at Wisconsin and suddenly was hit with this
                    thing. I hadn't even been in Washington enough to know. I mean, I knew what was
                    happening, from reading the paper, but I hadn't realized how permeated the
                    Department was with this fear of McLeod and McCarthy. The secretary wouldn't
                    stand up to him, either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I came into the Department just about that time, in 1955,
                        and I recall walking through the corridors around the security thing and
                        noticing that the preponderance of nameplates had X in the middle, which in
                        those days was a pretty good measure that they meant Xavier, which meant
                        they came from a Catholic family, which meant in those days that if they
                        were in security they probably were Irish policemen, probably out of New
                        York, who were a scary breed as far as intellectuals were concerned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I didn't detect much intellectual content in all the questioning, but I
                    did detect a swaggering dominance of the Department. I found that the Department
                    was scared to death of these men and did nothing to stop it. That's the feeling
                    I had, that we were caught up in some silly thing like this, which was utterly
                    ridiculous. My wife's family was a well-known family. He visited Russia with a
                    group of people, and then was very anti-Communist. But he did believe in
                    interracial meetings. He believed in freedom of discussion in his church and so
                    forth and so on. And then to tar me with this brush was horrible. And it was
                    horrible that the Department was so supine and didn't offer me any support. So I
                    was suspended for, I don't know, four months, five months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say suspended, they didn't pay you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No pay. Suspended without pay. They hoped I would resign, and I'm damned
                    if I would. I felt I had no reason to resign; I was not disloyal because I was
                    interested in labor as a force in the world. This was hardly anything bad, in my
                    view. So I didn't resign.</p>
                <p>Finally, there was one brave officer who sort of took pity on... (I was not
                    alone; there were a number of people who were suspended or thrown out. Some were
                    thrown out right away, others were suspended.) who sort of put pressure on. And
                    then Edward R. Murrow was helpful. He was anti-McCarthy.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A newspaperman.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: On TV, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, on TV in those days, early TV. Murrow's was the first
                        public voice, really, to raise itself against McCarthy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes. So finally all these ridiculous...they weren't really charges, all
                    these innuendoes were removed, and I was told, okay, you can come back into the
                    Department. Just like that. I wrote, of course, long pieces of paper describing
                    my background and, what I knew of it through learning at that time, about my
                    father-in-law. Also, another thing, he was born in Australia, so he was an
                    immigrant. He had come over forty years ago as an immigrant, as a young man. He
                    went to the Yale Theological Seminary, so he had pretty good credentials. I had
                    to write his whole history, from day one, and all this sort of thing.</p>
                <p>Anyway, finally, somebody in the inner working—you never knew who, it was like
                    casework sort of, innuendoes and things—finally I was told, well, all these,
                    just withdrawn, okay, go back in the Service. So I came back into the Service,
                    and then I went to Jo'burg.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were going to South Africa, to Johannesburg,
                        where you served from '54 to '57...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Jo'burg was '54 to '55, one year before I was transferred. That was an
                    actual transfer; that's thirty-five miles, so it was an actual transfer to
                    Pretoria.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To Pretoria. So, South Africa.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: South Africa, three years.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, no, not at that point.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, no, no. See, there wasn't much independence in Africa in those days.
                    This was '55. No, it was just a post, an assignment. And I was so glad to get
                    out of Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: My God, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I just grabbed at it, you might say. Besides, in those days, it was
                    different. You were told where you were going, you didn't bid and say no.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a post-preference report due the first of April

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I didn't know anything about South Africa, no. The whole Middle East was
                    closed to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain why.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Having served in Israel, I could not serve in an Arab country, in those
                    days, because my value would be nullified when the Arab government discovered I
                    had served in Israel. I was suspect. We had stamps on our passports. Israel
                    didn't put stamps on passports later on, but I had stamps on my passports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We couldn't send Jewish officers to Arab posts, and we
                        couldn't send officers who had served in Israel to Arab posts, either.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Right, so the Middle East was closed to me. Latin America I had had.
                    Basically, I think my wish list was another part of the world. I always wanted
                    Europe (I guess everybody wanted Europe), so I probably had put down Europe.
                    Having served twice in Latin America, I really wanted to see another part of the
                    world, hopefully... This came up, and I don't know if I was asked; I was told I
                    was going to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing when you went to Johannesburg?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>HOLMES: I was doing sort of Econ/Labor reporting. I'd had labor training at the
                    University of Wisconsin, and I was assigned as sort of the labor reporting
                    officer in the Economic Section. That involved my staying in touch with labor
                    unions in the Johannesburg area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In those days, was apartheid fully in place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, yes, yes, it was fully in place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we deal with it? Obviously, a large segment of the
                        labor that was being done in Johannesburg and around there that you reported
                        on was black African.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No. No, no. Trade unions were split, of course. There were white unions
                    and black unions. The black unions were virtually illegal; they only existed sub
                    rosa in those days. So the white trade unions were very white and were very much
                    part of the apartheid system, essentially.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were reporting on the labor situation, not just
                        the union situation, and a lot of the labor was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: A lot of the labor is black.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, but how did we play that at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, as I say, the labor unions were very small, very, very weak.
                    Strikes by black labor were illegal. So there were almost nonexistent. They did
                    exist, but in a very minor way. So most of the trade-union reporting, which I
                    did get involved in, was with white trade unions. So black labor existed, but it
                    was only... [static] of the total picture of the industrial situation, let's
                    say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern at that time by the AFL/CIO, which was
                        very important within our labor reporting there? Were they concerned about
                        black... at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Not very much. Not really. I think they may have said something along
                    those lines, but in fact not very much. Their contacts were with the trade union
                    federations; that means the white trade unions. There were several different,
                    competing federations, as I recall, but they were all white. One was more
                    liberal and was disposed toward helping black members. But it was such an
                    awkward situation, because strikes by black citizens were simply illegal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But whites could strike?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Whites could strike, yes. But there weren't many strikes. There was a
                    neat sort of arrangement between the unions and the employers' associations:
                    basically, white labor was allied with white employers to keep the blacks down.
                    The whites were scared to death of having blacks being able to perform skilled
                    labor. They were prevented from performing skilled labor, that was... They could
                    only perform unskilled labor. And the whites wanted to keep it this way,
                    basically. So it was a funny trade-union situation. I'm speaking in very broad
                    terms. There were exceptions, obviously.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But, also, you were a representative of the United States
                        from '54 to '57, which was just really before the civil-rights movement got
                        going in the United States. We weren't as sensitized to this at the
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Exactly. Right, we were not very gung ho in favor of black rights. We had
                    good relations with the South African government. We deplored some of the
                    excesses that took place, the beatings and the killings of blacks, which were
                    common, the arrests in the night and all that sort of thing. But we gave lip
                    service, I would say, to human rights in those days, more than real
                    interest.</p>
                <p>I was only one year in Jo'burg, by the way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then you moved where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Then the ambassador moved me to Pretoria, and I became the number-two
                    political officer; there were two of us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The ambassador at that time was Edward Wailes, was
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, it was Ambassador Wailes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give a little idea of what his approach was to
                        the South Africans and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, what do you mean? As you pointed out, this was before the days of
                    much sensitivity to human rights. In a general way, we were interested in human
                    rights, but political reporting was, as I recall, pretty much on the political
                    parties; that is, white parties, the Nationalist government versus the United
                    Party opposition. And it was cultivating contacts within the major political
                    parties. There was a Liberal Party, headed by Allen Peyton, but it was a very
                    small group of white intellectuals, let's say. I did meet Allen Peyton, we did
                    have contacts with the Liberal Party, but it was not an electoral threat to
                    anybody. It grew in time, and times have changed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were our interests... South Africa...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, it was just basically to maintain good relations. We were importing
                    uranium from South Africa, and many other minerals. South Africa is extremely
                    well endowed with precious minerals of all kinds, including platinum and uranium
                    and other things that are very important to our industry, and we were importing
                    lots of it. We had a space-tracking station in South Africa, and we had naval
                    visitation rights in Simonstown, which was a major naval base outside Cape Town.
                    So I think our approach to the situation was: Don't rock the boat. Keep good
                    relations with this important country.</p>
                <p>I don't mean that we totally ignored the black situation. I think, now and then,
                    we issued statements that we wished they would do a little more for the blacks.
                    And we did give scholarships, where we could, to black people. You know, an
                    exchange program. We tried to make the exchange program affect all the racial
                    elements: the Indians, the coloreds, the blacks, and the whites.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, ... the independence... the African countries.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Back here, you mean. Right, our own civil-rights movement, which was just
                    faintly beginning. So we reflected the American outlook. As I said, we tried,
                    now and then, and we did give scholarships and leader grants, which I think, in
                    the long run, have paid out, probably. Some of the leaders nowadays undoubtedly
                    were among those early choices to get to the United States to get a college
                    education or advanced degrees or whatever. So we didn't do nothing, but it was
                    very moderate.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there when Henry Byroade became ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, yes, I was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his form of operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: He was quite different from Wailes. Wailes was a professional Foreign
                    Service officer, a very adept, very smooth, very able man. Byroade was from a
                    different background. He had been pulled out of Egypt because of his fight with
                    Dulles over the Suez Canal situation, and this was, in a sense, exile for him,
                    it was clear. But he plunged in and was very, very much of an activist guy who
                    made lots of friends in various circles and so forth. Mind you, I was only there
                    a fairly short time, about six months, when I was transferred.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where you came back...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I came back to the Department. I was in INR, in the Southern African
                    section of INR.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was a pretty exciting time to be involved in African
                        affairs, wasn't it, from '57 to '60?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: It was a good time to be in INR, I must say, because there one had the
                    advantage of having a little time to think about things as they were
                    developing.</p>
                <p>Also, I was chosen for the first African Seminar. This was a very interesting
                    thing, that Africa was just beginning the whole movement toward independence all
                    over the continent. And the Ford Foundation put up seed money, because the
                    Department never had money for important and good things. The first African
                    Seminar picked twenty young FSOs who agreed to specialize in African affairs. We
                    had a chartered airplane, twenty of us, and we went to various African countries
                    for three months, and studied in universities, and met, in those days, colonial
                    government governors and colonial civil servants in the various places, to try
                    to get a feel of the new Africa. We started in Ghana, then Liberia, then across
                    the continent, and we included Kenya, Tanzania, Uganda, Northern Rhodesia,
                    Southern Rhodesia, South Africa, then back up the west coast to Senegal, and
                    then home, all in a three-month period. In each place, our consulate (we did
                    have consulates in those days, which probably helped determine where we went,
                    because we didn't have consulates in many other parts of Africa) arranged
                    programs with the local university, or, if there was no university, with some
                    similar study group that gave us an intensive program on the history and
                    economics and geography of the country.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>This is when we used to get those famous statements; I can remember the governor
                    of Kenya saying, “Well, there won't be independence here for at least a hundred
                    years. You young officers, I know you think there will be,” as he entertained us
                    at his wonderful palace, at his dinner party out of doors, with African dancers
                    shaking around. But I can remember his statement. And this was typical of some
                    of the states, although we did meet Tom Mboya, in Kenya, and had a private
                    session with him, the government did allow this. We met Nyerere, who was brought
                    up from Dar es Salaam to Nairobi and met with us for two days, and that was very
                    exciting. We met alone, without any white government people around. These were
                    still British colonial territories. But we did meet the people who were coming
                    up and who did, of course, become the leaders very soon, within a five-year
                    period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the impression that you were getting from...
                        African Seminar about wither Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I think we found it extremely exciting and interesting. We felt we
                    were in on the ground floor of what was clearly going to be a movement toward
                    independence.</p>
                <p>Oh, I should have mentioned that we also went to Lagos, Nigeria, which was very
                    interesting. We met the man who became the first prime minister of independent
                    Nigeria.</p>
                <p>It was very, very exciting. We were meeting, we felt, the leaders of the new
                    generation. We couldn't tell how soon it would come. We couldn't believe the
                    governor of Kenya that it would be a hundred years, but no one could foresee, I
                    don't think, the rapidity with which these countries, one after the other,
                    became independent, usually with a minimum of rioting and fighting. There was
                    some here and there, there was some nastiness. But it came very fast.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: As a matter of fact, we did. Yes, I'd forgotten that. We did include a

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, we didn't. That was very strict Belgian colonials... I don't think we
                    met many blacks in those days. We met mostly white...</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There really weren't many blacks to meet, in a way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I think they were in exile, those that... I think we did meet one or two,
                    perhaps, but they were toadies. We could tell, that situation was very different
                    from the situation in the British colonies, which were clearly evolving a
                    political leadership group, as well as intellectual. I don't mean we met only
                    politicians, we met journalists, we met some artists, we met other people who
                    would be in the new Africa, the independent Africa. No, we were very
                    disillusioned by Belgian Congo; it was rigid, it was extremely rigid.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you recall what...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, let's see, it was while I was in INR; it was probably '58. I had
                    been there about a year, and then people were selected from different parts of
                    the Department. You had to have had some African experience. Fortunately, I had
                    had the experience of South Africa, which counted as African. And the other
                    young guys had been in Algeria or Monrovia. There weren't too many places in
                    Africa in those days. But everyone had had at least one tour and agreed to serve
                    in the African Bureau, let's say, for a while. Not the whole rest of our
                    careers, necessarily, but it was understood that we had to take one or two
                    African assignments. So it was a very exciting time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you accepted when you came back from the seminar?
                        Were they saying, Oh, these guys are sort of bomb-throwers or something...
                        the Department...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, certainly the African Bureau, which in those days was part of NEA,
                    the Near East and African Bureau, but during that period broke away. Joe Palmer
                    became the first assistant secretary for Africa, as I recall. So there was this
                    recognition by the Department and by the U.S. government, by the president, that
                    Africa was going to become more and more important, as witness the separate
                    bureau. Then the roll of independence started within a year or so.</p>
                <p>So, no, I think we all thought it was an exciting part of the world. And from
                    then on, I stayed in Africa, as did a number of the other members of this
                    seminar. And there were two more seminars after ours. Ours was the first,
                    experimental. It worked so well, there was another one a couple of years later,
                    and then I think there was a third one, financed by the Department. The first
                    one was financed by Ford. It was fairly expensive, I suppose, since we had a
                    plane at our disposal, which was rather good, it stayed with us the entire
                    time.</p>

                    basically, you'd have to go into Europe and back down again. So we had our own
                    DC-3, which was not the most luxurious plane, but it got us from...</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: And it was really fun. We felt we were on the cutting edge,
                    basically.</p>
                <p>Then, back in INR, it was very active, and what I really concentrated on when I
                    came back was Rhodesia. This was the Rhodesian situation, the unilateral
                    declaration of independence, that sort of thing. And then there were riots in
                    Nyasaland, and Northern Rhodesia moved toward independence. I sort of was in
                    that area of reporting.</p>

                    the three elements of the Rhodesian Federation, which was in existence in those

                <p>But my feeling, as I remember at the time, and INR's, was that this federation
                    would not last. And I remember we got into trouble writing some papers in effect
                    saying that it isn't going to last; it's going to break up. Independence will
                    come first of all, we thought, to Northern Rhodesia, then to Nyasaland, which
                    became Malawi, with Southern Rhodesia being last, because there was a much
                    larger white element there and much more rigid control by settlers. The other
                    two were more colonial, typical colonial situations. Southern Rhodesia was more
                    like South Africa, in a sense.</p>
                <p>But I can remember predicting the breakup of the federation, and being lambasted
                    by the African Bureau, which didn't want to hear this. This was not in accord
                    with the U.S. government policy, which was to support this wonderful
                    federation.</p>
                <p>Well, it was wonderful; when it first started, it had some good elements. But it
                    was captured by right-wing Southern Rhodesian elements, frankly, who tended to
                    control it, and it became more and more apartheid minded. They never called it
                    apartheid, of course, and there was more freedom for blacks, but it was pretty
                    rigid.</p>
                <p>And I personally, and others with me in INR, tended to predict the breakup. I can
                    remember getting rockets from our consulate general in Southern Rhodesia, in
                    Salisbury, which didn't want to hear this and thought that the paper should
                    never have been printed. The consul general was furious, frankly. I don't
                    remember his name.</p>
                <p>But INR had a good deal of independence, and that's the way we felt; I felt very
                    strongly, and my colleagues did. Two or three of us had been on this seminar,
                    we'd been to Northern Rhodesia and Southern Rhodesia, and we had strong feelings
                    that Northern Rhodesia was really pushing for independence. We met Kenneth
                    Kaunda while we were there, by the way, who became, of course, the first
                    president and led the forces for independence, which did happen a few years
                    later. So we were right.</p>
                <p>But it was an exciting time, the whole African thing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing in Addis Ababa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I was chief of the Political Section in Addis. That was, of course, under
                    Haile Selassie.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about what the political situation (if you
                        want to call it that) was in Ethiopia in '60 to '63.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, well, once again, it was a time of much ferment. We didn't get there
                    on our tour, so it was all brand new to me. And, of course, it was one of the
                    two African countries that had been independent for a long time, in which we had
                    embassies for a long time, the other being Liberia. We had an embassy in
                    Liberia, we had an embassy in Addis Ababa, and that's about it except for South
                    Africa. In all these other places, if anything, we had a consulate. We didn't
                    have embassies because there were no independent countries (I'm leaving out the
                    northern littoral, the Mediterranean littoral). So I came into a
                    well-established situation. The emperor was the emperor; he ran the country
                    totally.</p>
                <p>My particular job there, as a younger political officer, was to establish
                    contacts with opposition elements, of which there were many, sub rosa, but
                    particularly the students.</p>
                <p>The emperor, in a way, was a very interesting person, a very astute man, or he
                    wouldn't have stayed on the throne over fifty years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He started in 1930, and one way or the other...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: There was an interlude, of course, when he was thrown out by the
                    Italians, Mussolini. He took exile in England, and then he was reinstated after
                    the war, and then kept on.</p>
                <p>He was a mixture, as are so many people, perhaps. He was an authoritarian, in the
                    old-fashioned sense; but he felt that the people were his children, in a sense.
                    He personally held court; he personally handed out pieces of gold to people who
                    needed help, in his audiences. We went to dinner at his palace, with flaming
                    torches and solid-gold plate, with liveried people, one butler behind each
                    chair, with the best French wines and so forth. That's one side of him, sort of
                    the old-fashioned imperial ruler. He was an emperor, not a king, but an emperor.
                    He felt this and he acted it.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>On the other hand, he established the Haile Selassie I University. He financed
                    that totally. Of course, there was no distinction, really, between private purse
                    and government purse there; everything was his and everything was government, it
                    was all intermixed. But he established this over the opposition of many of the
                    nobility; the nobility didn't want this. Like any emperor, even he had political
                    currents within the courtiers around the court. He established this and brought
                    in a lot of young American professors. Inevitably, what came from this was that
                    the young students became radicalized. That is, they wanted change. They were
                    embarrassed by this rigid, 10th-century, 12th-century type of government, as
                    they traveled for their higher degrees and so forth. And I will say, there were
                    some very brilliant young scholars developed in this university, many of whom
                    went to the States or England or France for further degrees. They were
                    embarrassed to realize that they were out of step with the rest of Africa. They
                    became very much pan-Africanists, in a sense, in that they wanted Ethiopia to
                    advance; they wanted a democratic government.</p>
                <p>So it was a very interesting period. And the embassy tried hard, frankly, to get
                    Haile Selassie to abdicate, to step down in favor of his son, the crown prince,
                    who had been educated in England, who was a centrist moderate, let's say, who
                    admired the British monarchy, who took as his model the British monarchy, so
                    that he would have been not exactly a figurehead, but he would have been a
                    constitutional monarch, with a prime minister and elections, real elections, to
                    choose a government under his general suzerainty.</p>
                <p>I think we could have prevented the revolution which came, but we were
                    unsuccessful. The emperor, at times, would seem to almost agree with us: Yes,
                    I've been on the throne fifty years. I can spend my declining years in England
                    or Geneva or wherever, it doesn't matter where, or even in Ethiopia, and
                    gracefully step aside. And his son, I think, could have held the situation, with
                    the change.</p>
                <p>The emperor didn't change. Just what we predicted. I can remember writing these
                    dispatches, in those days, long dispatches, with analogies, that this was going
                    to lead to... fairly soon. We couldn't tell when or exactly how. It happened
                    just exactly... the young students, the young military officers, the majors
                    downward. Above major, you got into the royalty, into the courtier system, the
                    colonels and so forth. But below that, you had these young officers, many of
                    whom were trained in the United States, or at least had post-graduate training
                    in military at our various institutions, West Point or wherever, and came back.
                    They were in league with the students, you might say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: What happened exactly, well, we couldn't figure it. Communism, exactly,
                    but it was worse than we expected.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ... How did we view Eritrea in those days?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, it had been taken over by the emperor, and I was there when it
                    happened, actually. He simply, by decree... Well, first of all, he undermined it
                    through powers of the purse, let's say. He was a very astute, able, ...
                    politician, I would say, ... and, although you might not agree with his methods,
                    which were sometimes very rough on those who opposed him (that is, the gallows
                    or bullets to get rid of them, which was the old-fashioned way, after all, he
                    was still a man of...), he simply took over Eritrea. And we all thought that
                    would lead to trouble. During the period that I was there, there was a lot of
                    ferment in Eritrea, a lot of ferment, but one assumed that, at least as long as
                    he lasted, he could hold it, hold it by brute force. The army, the army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we were sort held... to Cagnew Station, weren't we,
                        in everything we did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, of course, Cagnew was a terribly important thing. On the other
                    hand, we could see that the explosion was coming, that's all, and that's why we
                    urged him to step down. So as to save Cagnew, in a way, but by changing the type
                    of government. That is, a constitutional monarchy is what we foresaw, which
                    would be stable and still adapt to the demands of the youth.</p>
                <p>It was more or less a split on age, the youth in army and in civilians and in
                    professions or wherever versus the older people who were tied up with the
                    government; they were the landholders. You had the three pillars of the society:
                    you had the crown and the nobility; you had the landholders, huge estates; and
                    you had the clergy. The emperor was the head of the church, the Ethiopian Coptic
                    Church. So these were the three pillars. But outside of that, he had this
                    ferment, the young people, the younger elements. So it was a fascinating
                    period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any dealings with the nobility and the

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, yes. Mostly that would be done by the ambassador or the number-two
                    man, the DCM. I was at the political level, sort of more reporting on, in a
                    sense, the opposition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The ambassador was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Arthur Richards.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, he was a professional Foreign Service officer, and he did the
                    proper job, he maintained contact with the government. He was not keen on
                    pushing the emperor toward reform, at all. His successor was Ed Korry, who was a
                    very different sort of person. He was a journalist, a non-career man. First of
                    all, he spoke excellent French. Richards did not speak French, so that was
                    awkward. The emperor spoke Amharic or French, with very little English. Korry
                    could speak French, and so could speak more easily with the emperor, and was
                    much more willing to push the emperor for reform, for his own good and for the
                    good of the country. There was this sort of thing, and I think Korry certainly
                    recognized the need for reform, perhaps more than Ambassador Richards did.
                    Ambassador Richards carried on, I guess, a certain tradition of maintaining
                    contact with the government, which was the emperor.</p>
                <p>The emperor was everything. The ministers came and went at the emperor's
                    pleasure. They would be exiled overnight, and then they might come back in six
                    months, or disappear, or...</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. You'd get the official line, of course, from the
                    Foreign Ministry. But there were young officials that one could cultivate. Many
                    of them were wholeheartedly with the opposition, although they had positions.
                    They were younger. And it's almost entirely age, almost; there were exceptions

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes. They were quite... But during my three years there, it became
                    noticeably freer, that they were seeking out more and more. It was quite a
                    change. The emperor had a very highly efficient secret service, and knew, I'm
                    sure, that a lot of this was going on. And people from time to time, if they
                    overstepped the boundary, might disappear or be arrested, which was fairly
                    common. Sometimes they'd be held for two weeks, or six weeks, and then back into
                    their jobs again. First of all, they would have to go before the emperor
                    personally, to be chastised by him. If he felt their attitude was proper, then
                    he would let them go back into their position as director general of the XYZ
                    Agriculture Department or whatever. It was a personalized type of old-fashioned
                    system. That's all I can say, it was old fashioned.</p>
                <p>He was an outstandingly able guy, but he..., I think, couldn't quite appreciate
                    the modern world and the demand for... constitutional government. They wanted
                    real elections; they wanted to be able to vote; they wanted a parliament. There
                    was a fake parliament, there were fake elections, but they wanted the real
                    thing. And I don't think he quite understood the... well, obviously, he didn't,
                    as we see what happened to him. He was brutally killed.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, for Africa, we had a very large military-assistance program. This,
                    in a sense, was quid pro quo for Cagnew Station; it was ransom. It was never
                    called that, of course, but it was clear that... And there was a lot of
                    training. So our military people were very much involved. We had an MAP, a
                    Military Assistance Program, large, over a hundred people, which is large for
                    that... And we did a lot of training, a lot of equipment, trained the air force,
                    brought in F-16s or whatever. F-14s or something.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: Well, I'm not a military person. There were always arguments, and the
                    emperor always wanted more. And our main approach was trying to keep it within
                    some reasonable bounds. The annual battle was the military-assistance budget,
                    which was very, very important. And we always had to balance what we could get
                    by with and keep Cagnew. The emperor, of course, would keep coming over and
                    meeting with presidents. Presidents loved to receive the emperor; it was sort of
                    fun, I think, and the emperor loved to get into the White House. Both sides felt
                    it was sort of fun, I think, so he almost had an annual visit.</p>

                    there was always how to whittle down the demands for another twenty million
                    dollars for God knows what, more tanks and more of this and that.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: Oh, sure, that was very much in our cognizance, that situation, and we
                    devoted an awful lot of energy to trying to keep the border quiet, both our
                    embassy in Mogadishu and... We worked together, in a way, on these things. We
                    tried to have a restraining influence. And I think we... Incidents were
                    constant, and some fighting every now and then was a little more than incidents,
                    but on the whole, that situation didn't blow up, at least, which took a lot of
                    work on both sides to damp it down.</p>

                        well, here we are, still, or something like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, not really. I got to Blantyre, and the British governor was still
                    there; it was still a colony (technically a protectorate, but it's about the
                    same, really). But it was very, very clear that independence was coming. And it
                    came within six months or so after my arrival.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I was a consul. You see, this was under the old structure. I was
                    technically assigned to Salisbury, because this was rapidly changing. The
                    British didn't like the idea of our having separate consulates in Northern
                    Rhodesia and Nyasaland because that would indicate we thought the place was
                    going to become independent. They wanted us to be in Salisbury, which was the
                    capital of the federation. So technically I was assigned to Salisbury, but on
                    detached duty to Blantyre. It was a fig leaf. By then, the fig leaf was very
                    thin, although technically I was assigned to Salisbury (detailed to
                    Blantyre).</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>But that didn't last long, because, as I say, when I arrived it was very clear,
                    within a very short time, although the date hadn't been set, but it was clear
                    that there was going to be independence. There had been serious riots in
                    Blantyre. The British troops had fired and forty-five people were killed...
                    [static] but once they... the whole federal structure of government, the civil
                    service and so forth, ended.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing, preparing for an embassy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, preparing for an embassy. But while I was there, I was consul in
                    charge, it was called, at the consulate.</p>

                    support. He didn't ask for it... well, of course, he was... he was not in a
                    position to ask... I met with him frequently, he came to my house on occasion...
                    other times I'd talk to him on the phone... He wanted moral support.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: No, he never... He, of course, trained in the United States... lived
                    in... many years. He was very... In a sense, he was called back as a figurehead
                    by the young... But he took over; he was not a figurehead. He was a very

                    down forcefully. He was not... shortly after... while I was still there, it
                    happened.</p>

                    doing... moral support. We had to walk a little bit of a tightrope. After all,
                    the British are our... allies... too strongly. I had very good relations with
                    the governor... around the country... preparing... transition took place,
                    although... He was...</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: ... Oh, well, that was one of those curious situations. Blantyre is and
                    was a major city... commercial. It's still small; the whole place is small,
                    everything's small. But Zomba was up in the highlands, and that was the British
                    colonial capital, and that was about one hour's drive from Blantyre. Actually, I
                    lived in Blantyre, but went to Zomba for talks with the governor. The governor
                    lived there, as did the British administration. But Dr. Banda lived in Blantyre.
                    So, I don't know what to say. As I say, I was assigned to Salisbury... to
                    Blantyre, although he capital was in Zomba...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Sixty-five.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went back with the Africa Bureau. What were you
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: First of all, I spent a year in the Operations Center, which is the place
                    in the Department that never sleeps, that receives cables round the clock,
                    particularly after hours, and decides what is urgent enough to merit calling
                    somebody. We have the authority to call the secretary at home, which we have
                    used on some occasions. Those were the days of the Vietnam situation, so there
                    was an awful lot of traffic from Vietnam, with the secretary, of course, being
                    terribly interested in it, as was President Johnson. So it was a very
                    interesting time, because it was constant troubles or interesting developments
                    in Vietnam. So I served one year in the Ops. Center, which is normal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sort of burns you out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, you work at odd hours, round the clock, and you take shifts, the
                    midnight shift and so forth; you keep moving around in your time.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>So then, from there, I moved back to the African Bureau and became country
                    director for... Not at first. First, I was, I guess, country officer for
                    Rhodesia and Malawi, something like that. This was a time of shuffling around in
                    the Bureau, and then I did become country director for what was called Southeast
                    Africa, which was Tanzania, Kenya, Uganda, and the Rhodesias, that area.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, that was a typical job of a country director handling all...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there during the... UDI?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, UDI, right. And we didn't recognize... The British never recognized
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain how we used the situation... Southern
                        Rhodesia became Zimbabwe, how this developed and what our attitude
                        was...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, with the breakup of the federation, which started when I was in
                    Blantyre, that was the first element of the three breakaways, once that
                    happened, Northern Rhodesia followed very soon thereafter. So the federation
                    broke into its three constituent elements, with the northern two, of course,
                    controlled by African governments, but Rhodesia being controlled by white
                    settler elements. There was an election in Rhodesia, and the more liberal party,
                    headed by Todd, was thrown out and a much more rightist group took over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ian Smith.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Ian Smith and the Rhodesian Front. They chafed under British control. I
                    mean, they said, after all, the other two elements in the federation are
                    independent, we want our independence, basically, we don't want to be a colony
                    any longer. Britain moved slowly, I would say, and they just simply declared
                    their independence at some point. The British, I don't think, ... would ever do
                    that, but they did it. And then the British clamped down and refused to
                    recognize their independence. We and most of the world followed suit and did not
                    recognize them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did we do then? Did we still keep our consulate
                        general?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>HOLMES: We had a consulate general there, headed by Paul O'Neal, a good friend of
                    mine, who finally closed it down after about a year. There was a question of
                    whether we should or not, and the British allowed us to keep it for a long while
                    as sort of a listening post, one way of maintaining contact.</p>
                <p>I think the British felt at first that this would be over with fairly soon, that
                    these people would come to their senses and drop their independence. But it
                    didn't work that way; they were very resolute, the Southern Rhodesians. There
                    were sanctions applied to them by the United Nations, mandatory sanctions. I
                    think it was the first time of mandatory sanctions, which we subscribed to. But,
                    after all, they bordered South Africa, and the border was clearly open—oil came
                    through, everything came through. So sanctions didn't affect them too much. It
                    had a disruptive effect, particularly on their exports, but even then, they
                    managed. It lasted for quite a few years, I can't tell you how long.</p>
                <p>But all the time that I was working on that, that was the big thing, our
                    relations, the whole UDI situation. What were we going to do? What was going to
                    happen? ... the old throne or not? Would the British succeed? And also this
                    developed into a political thing back here, with certain right-wing elements in
                    our Congress saying we should recognize this good Christian gentleman, Ian
                    Smith, who no doubt put the blacks down, and why are we bringing these good
                    people down? There were delegations that came out and met over here. So there
                    was constant turmoil during that whole period, over the whole question of trying
                    to maintain sanctions, which we did maintain, pretty much, until the end, I
                    think, although the pressures were growing to drop sanctions, in Congress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the Nixon administration came in and Henry Kissinger
                        was sort of running the show, did you feel that there was a change in our
                        attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes. Kissinger, of course, was a much more active secretary. He
                    personally got involved in trying to solve this situation, and also pressured
                    the British just to end it somehow, to end it... recognize... But that didn't
                    happen... Well, you know, there were endless meetings. There was a meeting
                    aboard the Tiger, the British battleship, and they almost reached agreement, and
                    then it fell through. But finally, the British earlier... There was a formula,
                    there was a formula, a face-saving formula, which was arranged... I can't
                    remember, I had gone by then. Of course, I read about it. Somehow it was... It
                    ended on pretty well British terms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As far as Africa went, this was sort of the main show in
                        Africa, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, the other African countries were very, very much against Ian Smith,
                    of course. They felt it should be a really independent country, with free
                    elections, which would mean a black government, as has happened since. So they
                    were very much pressuring us to keep the sanctions going and to close our
                    consulates to him, which we eventually did. They wanted us to close the
                    consulates because they felt that that was a link to the hated Ian Smith
                    regime.</p>
                <p>Yes, we were under enormous pressure from black Africa. They had meetings, and
                    the Organization of African Unity would always condemn, of course, Ian Smith.
                    They felt the British should just send in troops and end this thing. But the
                    British were not about to send troops. It was clear that they were not about to
                    send troops to put down their own kith and kin, you might say. These settler
                    families were well connected in England, particularly the Conservative Party.
                    So, although they maintained this sanctions program pretty carefully, they never
                    were about to put in troops, as the black countries thought they should.</p>
                <p>So we were in the middle of this, in a sense. Although it was not our problem,
                    what we did carried a lot of weight. So it was an interesting time, I would
                    say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about events in Kenya and Tanzania? Did you cover
                        those, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, but there were no tremendous problems there. Our attention was
                    pretty well focused on the Rhodesian problem, because when it gets into
                    Congress, as you know, then you get congressional letters, then you have to
                    justify things and explain things.</p>
                <p>Besides which, American companies were not keen on this, particularly some of our
                    mining companies who had mining interests in Rhodesia. Their big thing was
                    chromium. A big battle over chromium. We had to have chromium for our military
                    uses, for our defense establishment. Everything would collapse if they couldn't
                    bring up the chromium from their mines there. But the embargo cut that off, and
                    so they were pulling and hauling.</p>
                <p>It was very much a domestic political issue. So the Desk, obviously, got involved
                    in all sorts of papers and explanations, talking. It took an awful lot of our
                    time.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: I went back to South Africa as consul general in Durban.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '71 to '75.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, a four-year period in Durban as consul general. It was extremely
                    interesting, because, of course, I had served in South Africa before, to see the
                    changes. There were a lot of changes, although not the changes that have come
                    more recently. Apartheid was even more rigid, in one sense, but there was
                    clearly more opposition to apartheid within the black community. There were
                    stirrings of all kinds within the ANC (African National Congress), underground
                    elements, students.</p>
                <p>Durban is in the heart of Zululand. The Zulu tribe is the largest African tribe
                    in South Africa, headed by Buthelezi, who's still in the news. And one of my
                    important charges there was to establish contact with Buthelezi, who lived a
                    two- or three-hours' drive away from Durban. My predecessor had established good
                    contacts with him, and I was enjoined to keep on with this contact, as one way
                    of seeing what the largest tribe in Africa, at least, what they were thinking.
                    Buthelezi was technically head of the ... couldn't stay in a white hotel, still,
                    in those days. It's hard to believe how things have changed there. He would stay
                    with me in the consulate residence frequently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ... important figure. How did you evaluate
                        Buthelezi...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, he was a very astute politician, a very able leader of his people,
                    of the Zulu nation. As I said, we would go up there frequently. He had a
                    parliament that met, and we'd go to the opening of parliament. It was very much
                    on the British model. I would say he's pro-British, basically, or at least the
                    British way of governing, let's say. Well, it was ... that is, the whole
                    situation in South Africa, although it hadn't reached the point of this enormous
                    change that we see nowadays, was still pretty grim for blacks.</p>
                <p>That is, I knew Steve Biko personally. He was a student in Natal at the black
                    medical college. The only black medical college in those days, in all of South
                    Africa, was in Durban. Durban was sort of, in a sense, a liberal element. It's
                    the only province that's dominated by English-speaking people, so it has a
                    certain tradition of British liberalism. And so it has various elements, the
                    University of Natal is really a liberal sort of place. And you had this black
                    medical college. And Steve Biko, of some fame now, who was murdered by the
                    police there eventually, I knew him, he came to my home. I would see him and
                    other students. And one had to be somewhat discreet because the South African
                    intelligence services are very good. I know my phone was tapped and my mail was
                    opened, that's almost routine. But one could meet these people.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it implicit that you were to make contact with...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: All elements. I think, I think, yes. By then, our policy had changed
                    considerably from my first time there... essentially... all elements of the
                    population... At first, white officials refused to come to our parties. But that
                    was changing. Every party I gave was multi-racial; I just didn't give purely
                    white... perhaps... dinner, possibly. But essentially all of my official parties
                    were mixed, deliberately. I think, for the first year, the white officials did
                    not come, but I think, by the second year, they did come. So there was some
                    change going on.</p>
                <p>This was a symbolic thing, but you know. There was an order that no white
                    official would shake hands with a non-white; there was a written order at one
                    point in South Africa. That changed.</p>
                <p>During my four years there, I saw a lot of change on a personal level; that is,
                    people would come and would talk with black people. Some whites would tell me,
                    “This is the first time I've ever talked to a black person, except my household
                    domestic staff. And, oh, so and so is certainly an interesting man,” whether he
                    was a journalist or a doctor. There was a growing black professional class,
                    mostly who had been trained overseas and came back. So things were changing in
                    that sense, although apartheid was still extremely rigid.</p>
                <p>Even that changed slightly. I remember Buthelezi, by the end of my time there,
                    could stay in a so-called white hotel. Before, he could not. He had to stay in a
                    wretched little black hotel, which was really a filthy little place that he
                    wouldn't stay in. And so he enjoyed staying in my house because he could find it
                    amenable to him. But that did change; he could stay in the best hotel in
                    town—not all hotels, but certain ones. So there were changes on the social
                    level.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the Afrikaans society would close you
                        out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, I had, how should I say, appropriate contacts with the establishment.
                    The so- called administrator of Natal Province was an Afrikaner, whom I would
                    meet officially. The head of the police, the head of the army were all
                    Afrikaners, because these are appointed by the national government. No, I had
                    correct relations with them, not exactly warm relations. Most of my contacts
                    tended to be with others, non-official, you might say. In the university and the
                    press and the church there were a lot of outstanding people. Now some of these
                    people in these other elements were Afrikaners.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>One of the most outstanding men I knew there, bravest men, was an Afrikaner
                    professor at the university, a professor of law, who would defend blacks who
                    were scooped up by the police and charged with all sorts of heinous crimes. He
                    would go to bat for them. He was a brilliant orator, and I would sometimes
                    attend the trials that were held in the provincial capital, Pietermaritzburg,
                    about an hour's drive from Durban, just to hear him speak and needle the... But
                    he was so brilliant and so well versed in the law, he succeeded very frequently
                    in defending these people and getting them released.</p>
                <p>So it's not all English-speaking, by any means. Many were, but they were not
                    government people; they were non-government, but important people, journalists,
                    let's say. The newspapers there were very open, English-language press, with
                    some valiant editors and reporters. South Africa is a combination of things,
                    rigid in many ways, but they did have freedom of the press more or less all the
                    time.</p>
                <p>So the background for recent developments was happening then. But I don't think
                    any of us foresaw the enormous changes that the present president has brought
                    about in South Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left in '75, how did you feel about whither South
                        Africa?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I felt very discouraged. I really did. I had seen a lot of my friends
                    arrested. Steve Biko had been. He hadn't been killed yet; he was under
                    detention. But I had many other friends, who were brilliant young men and women
                    (mostly men, it just happened, because of the situation) who had been educated
                    overseas, who were terribly discouraged because the government was rigid. If
                    they went too far, they could be arrested, they could be banned. I had a number
                    of people who were friends of mine who were banned, which means sort of house
                    arrest, they can't see anybody. They're not in jail exactly, they're living in
                    their home. But this threat hung over them. These were extrajudicial things:
                    there was no appeal, it didn't go to court, it was the order of a minister. And
                    once you had a banning order, you were banned for a year or two years or three
                    years. And it could be renewed; some people were banned year after year after
                    year.</p>
                <p>So there was great discouragement. I was discouraged when I left. I feared it
                    would lead to a blowup of some kind, a huge blowup of black against white, a
                    vicious, bloody sort of thing. I just couldn't imagine that the government would
                    change as much as it has done. I think it caught a lot of people by surprise. I
                    don't think I was particularly obtuse at this. Everything I saw was this
                    repression, with the secret service very powerful. Informers. If you'd get two
                    or three blacks around, they wouldn't even open up because they didn't know but
                    what the other one was an informer. There were informer networks. It's easy to
                    see why, because with blacks who were oppressed, to get a job or some money was
                    very appealing.</p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>No, it was discouraging when I left. I couldn't have imagined the changes that in
                    fact have occurred.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in '75 and went to USIA.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, that was fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For about two years, '75 to '77.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, this was part of the interagency swapping of people that the State
                    Department every now and then gets excited about and does for a while. So I
                    became deputy director for Africa of the USIA, not Northern Africa, but all of
                    South Saharan Africa. That was great fun; I thoroughly enjoyed that. I visited
                    almost every country in Africa. USIA typically has more travel funds than the
                    State Department has, and not only did I not have to fight to get funds for
                    trips, I was urged to go, by the director, who wanted me to go, wanted me to see
                    the posts in person and visit them and see what their problems were. So I
                    visited almost every country in Africa, not to inspect, but to meet with our
                    USIA people, see our libraries, see what programs we had and what the problems
                    were, what more we could do to support them back here. It was a really fun two
                    years, to be with another agency. It is very closely aligned with State,
                    obviously, because we constantly go back and forth with State. But I loved the
                    fact that they had all these travel funds, and I traveled a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the USIA operations at that

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Excellent, really excellent, given the funds and so forth. But I felt
                    that everyplace, even in some of these small little capitals, ..., little
                    places, ... and whatnot, there was the American library, and it was a real
                    symbol of the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the main thrust, wasn't it, to...</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, somehow the library was the visible source, yes. But beyond that,
                    of course, we had the leader grant program, carried on largely by USIA, with the
                    embassy, obviously, and we had assistance to newspapers; that is, material,
                    background material, as needed by fledgling governments who wanted assistance
                    and information and so on, the whole thing. But the library was the symbol,
                    because that was open to the public, and there it was on the main street,
                    usually, of these small places. Sometimes, they were very small libraries; other
                    times, they were larger. But in the library, that was the focus. Then they had
                    movie shows, they had lectures, with the leader grant program of American
                    scholars coming out, sometimes, to these places.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we trying to do? Were we trying to tell the
                        story of the United States, or were we, in actual fact, more trying to
                        foster democracy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Both. Both. I think the two are inescapably intertwined. I mean, we are a
                    democratic country, and I think we preach the democratic gospel. Some people say
                    it's propaganda. To some degree it probably is. But the Voice of America is
                    always very important, likewise, in getting the word about what's happening in
                    the world. These small countries lack access to the outside world, so they're
                    hungry for contact, you might say. And this we tried to furnish.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find there was a problem in the francophone
                        countries with our operation? Did the French sort of resent..., or at this
                        point was there...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: There had been in the past, much more than, I think, nowadays. They know
                    what our operation is. I don't think the French find it... We don't attack the
                    French, after all. There's some residue of that, perhaps, here and there, but I
                    don't think it's a serious problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't a major overtone.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, no, I don't think so, because after all, these countries are
                    independent, even though they're francophone and their leaders are trained in
                    France and so forth, so we aren't going to subvert them. They ask for many of
                    the things that we can furnish: scholarships, books, programs. I think they're
                    pleased. And, as I say, we're not trying to subvert the French influence in any
                    way; we're not trying to undermine it.</p>
                <p>I think that in the early days of African independence, all the colonial powers
                    felt that the United States, Jack Kennedy particularly, was out there fighting
                    against them— whether it was Belgium, Portugal, England, France, or
                    Spain—because we preached the message, after the war, of independence, sure we
                    did.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>But I didn't feel that during this period, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your last post was Ghana, where you served from '77 to
                        '80. How did you get that, and what were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, as usual for DCM positions, I happened to know the ambassador. I
                    had served with him in South Africa; he had been in Cape Town as political
                    officer, way back.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Bob Smith, a wonderful, capable, outstanding officer, I thought. When I
                    was back here and my two-year tour was coming to an end, I was looking for what
                    was going to be next, and I got this marvelous cable from him, saying would you
                    like to come here as DCM? His DCM was leaving and there was an opening. And I
                    said yes, not that I knew Ghana very much. I had been there on that African
                    Seminar, and I had visited there a number of times in my USIA job. As a matter
                    of fact, I had seen Bob Smith there, as part of my visitation. So I went as DCM
                    there.</p>
                <p>And it was very interesting. I remember my arrival, Bob met me at the airport and
                    said, “So glad you're here. I'm leaving in five days for delayed home leave. At
                    last, I'm going to get my home leave!”</p>
                <p>So I was charg� for two months, when I barely knew the names of the people in the
                    various divisions of the embassy. But I got through it. It's not the best way to
                    become charg� and run an embassy, which was very active, with a military
                    attach�, with a large AID program, with the other agencies there and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political situation in this period, '77 to
                        '80?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: There was an unstable situation. When Bob was transferred to become
                    ambassador to Liberia in '79, I was charg� once again. Then there was a
                    revolution and President Hilla Limann came in. It was a military coup; rather
                    severe fighting all around the embassy and around the various homes and so
                    forth. We came awfully close to evacuation, very, very close, but we didn't do
                    it. But that was an exciting period, wondering whether we should evacuate
                    Americans because of safety concerns.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were American interests in Ghana when you came?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I guess, no specific strategic interests. It was part of the
                    general thing of maintaining good relations with Ghana, which has been a
                    traditionally important country in West Africa, I guess because Nkrumah was one
                    of the very first leaders when Ghana became independent, and he was a symbol of
                    African independence, in a way, and he was involved with independence movements
                    all over Africa. Ghana traditionally has had a large, well-educated community.
                    Under British days, it happened that way, that there were a large number of
                    Ghanaians who had university educations overseas, who now serve in the United
                    Nations, for instance. There are a lot of Ghanaians who serve as economists and
                    whatnot.</p>
                <p>But not specific strategic interests, not like Cagnew Station in Ethiopia and
                    that sort of thing. But it was helping them, and we had an AID program. It was
                    sort of the typical things of relationships with this sort of important country.
                    We had a lot of visitors from the States come to Ghana. So I would say, just
                    sort of normal relationships, helping where we could. Their economic situation
                    was not the best.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before the revolution, how did you find dealing with the
                        Ghanaian government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Ghanaians, as a people, are wonderful. They're open, they're friendly,
                    they're pro- American. An awful lot of them have been to the States, or if they
                    haven't been, they have relatives who are here, or have been, or hope to come.
                    There's an enormous looking toward the United States. Although it's a former
                    British colony, of course, and there's still British influence there,
                    particularly the older people, the younger people look toward the States. It's
                    the mecca. They're really wonderful people—open, friendly. So it was great.</p>
                <p>My wife took a great interest in African dancing, and as a result of that, we
                    used to go sometimes into the interior to small villages where they were having
                    festivals. We'd be the only white people there, and there'd be large numbers of
                    African people who had assembled for festivals. And they would treat us so well,
                    just wonderfully; they couldn't do enough for us. They were delighted that we
                    had come. As I said, my wife was studying African dance, under a teacher and so
                    forth. She arranged these things, mostly, because dancing is part of their
                    festivals, always. They're wonderful dancers, and they're wonderful musicians.
                    They have very, very intricate music, particularly percussion, drumming. We got
                    involved in that sort of thing, but my wife said she never felt ill at ease in
                    Ghana, as sometimes she had felt in some other countries, at different periods.
                    If she got stuck, there would always be somebody who would appear, to help her
                    to get the car started, or fix a flat tire. She would go with some of her
                    Ghanaian friends. She was very active in the Ghanaian-American women's group,
                    sort of got that going. So she would get invited to these places. Sometimes I
                    went with her, and if I couldn't, she would go with her Ghanaian friends and
                    just loved it. She just loved Ghana.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would you talk about what happened during the revolution?
                        Embassies in crises are always an important thing. How did this coup, or
                        revolt, come about, and what were we doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I would say, with all its wonderful attributes, Ghana has an awful lot of
                    corruption, which is not unique to Ghana, certainly, this is endemic in many
                    parts of the world. But the corruption got really pretty bad. Then, in 1979, the
                    government of the generals was overthrown by young officers and noncommissioned
                    officers, led and inspired by an air force flight lieutenant, Jerry Rawlings,
                    who wanted to put basically an end to the corruption. That was, I think, his
                    main thrust. And to do that, he simply took over, in a typical military coup.
                    There was some fighting in Accra. What can I say? He was successful. And we very
                    soon established contact with him.</p>
                <p>But this did delay the arrival of our new ambassador, Thomas Smith, who had been
                    named. He [Lt. Rawlings or President Limann?] didn't want to think about such
                    things as giving the agr�ment to a new ambassador. He was very busy with lots of
                    other things, and so he said, “I'll get to that, I'll get to that,” when we
                    talked to him. But there was a long delay as he tried to take over the reins of
                    government, to try to bring in reforms. Then there were trials of some of the
                    previous people, and seizures of ill-gotten assets, including houses and so
                    forth. So that it was a period of turmoil, and he just didn't want to have a new
                    ambassador, at that point, arrive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned, after a change in government... I can't
                        remember, had the Liberian overthrow happened before this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, it hadn't. No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you, either under instructions or on your own,
                        saying, I hope it's not going to be a bloodbath that won't do any good?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, I think we took it very much in stride, the change. I think we
                    recognized the new regime, a de facto recognition, fairly soon. I was permitted
                    to deal with him as the power, the de facto head of government, which he was. We
                    did counsel restraint, as we always do. I don't think there were any executions
                    at all. [Generals Acheampong and Akuffo were executed.] I think there were some
                    jailings, which is not so bad in Africa, because the full term is rarely ever
                    served. I think we did counsel restraint, as we, I think, always do in cases
                    like this. We're not in favor of executions, although there were gross
                    transgressions, let's say, of fiscal sanity. There were people put in jail, and
                    there was some grabbing of houses, ill-gotten gains. I don't think we got
                    involved in that at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the coup happened and the firing went on, what
                        happened to you all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>HOLMES: No Americans got killed, but there were some escapades where Americans
                    were in the way of things. So we urged Americans to stay at home, the usual
                    thing. We assembled a few who were in places that looked rather dangerous. But
                    there was fighting in the streets, different elements of the armed forces. It
                    wasn't a smooth, easy takeover. It got dicey at some points, because the water
                    went off, the electricity went off, that sort of thing. We considered
                    evacuation, but we didn't have to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Washington counseling anything at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, they leave it more or less to the personnel on the ground, with the
                    country team meeting constantly on what...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this before the Tehran business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Golly, I...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because that was towards the end of '79. I think, after
                        that, Washington was not letting anything happen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I think, before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would assume it would have been before.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: We never felt in danger from the government in any way, unlike the Tehran
                    situation. We never felt any of that sort of thing. The danger was from
                    soldiers, some of whom were not necessarily in total control of their officers,
                    some of whom were drunk, let's face it, and firing around. And they did go after
                    the Lebanese community rather severely. One embassy wife, they did invade the
                    house. This was the wife of an officer, who was in the embassy at the time,
                    working. And some drunken soldiers came into the house and, you know, it was
                    terrifying. Our Marines had to go there and rescue her and get her out of the
                    house, which they did all safely. But it was a nasty incident. Now that was not
                    the government's fault at all. This was a couple of drunken soldiers, frankly,
                    who had guns. But you never know what they're going to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, you don't.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>HOLMES: And they were looking for Lebanese. The Lebanese tended to live in areas
                    where Americans lived, in some nice houses and so forth. And they couldn't
                    always tell the difference, necessarily, between a Lebanese and perhaps an
                    American.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would they do to the Lebanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, they were pretty brutal with them, in some cases. They tended to be
                    the shopkeepers, and there were resentments, and they were trying to get them to
                    leave, you might say. This didn't last long, and it passed away. But they got
                    some and demanded some ransom, let's say, or fines and so forth. It was
                    difficult. The Lebanese ambassador was very, very obviously worried about this
                    situation. There were quite a few Lebanese living there, for many years, you
                    know, they are shopkeepers and merchants. So that got a little bit dicey.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I left in 1980. That's when I retired. I had thirty-five years in the
                    Foreign Service. Frankly, they talked about another foreign post, but my wife
                    just finally said, “We have a house in Washington. We have three kids. I don't
                    see them anymore.” We used to have the kids with us all the way. We haven't
                    talked about that, but all the way through Africa, our kids stayed with us,
                    until the time when I was back here in INR for that five-year period. We got
                    them through high school at that point, and then they went on to college. But
                    then they were not with us anymore. And she said, “Basically, I think I've had
                    enough. I want to be in Washington.”</p>
                <p>This was a dichotomy. I could have had a job in Washington, but I just didn't
                    want to work in Washington. I'd lost interest, after thirty-five years, in
                    working in Washington again. So I said, “I don't want that, I want overseas.”
                    And she said, “I don't want overseas, I want Washington.” So we compromised—I
                    retired. I retired at post, and that was it.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: Okay.</p>
