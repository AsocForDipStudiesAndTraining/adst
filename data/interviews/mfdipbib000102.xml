                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I am Henry Precht, a retired Foreign Service officer. I'm
                        interviewing Archer Blood, another retired Foreign Service officer with
                        extensive experience in South Asia. The interview takes place on June 27,
                        1989, at his home in Meadville, Pennsylvania.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Perhaps, Arch, to start with you could give a brief summary of your career for
                    the benefit of those people who will be using this material.</p>
                <p>BLOOD: I entered the Foreign Service in July 29, 1947. My reasons for doing so
                    are still very vague in my own mind. I'd never been abroad except in the Navy in
                    the Aleutians. I'd never known anybody in the Foreign Service. But I had
                    developed in my teens an interest in the Foreign Service, and when I entered
                    college, I put that down as my career preference. Then I began to alternate with
                    law. And I was in law school at the University of Virginia when I passed my
                    orals for the Foreign Service. I had to make a quick decision as to which way I
                    would go, and I opted for the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>It was a good time to enter the Service because it was expanding. There were
                    forty people in our class, and there was a class of almost forty during the
                    summer of 1947.</p>
                <p>My first post was Thessaloniki, Greece, at the time of the civil war against the
                    communist-supported insurgents who were trying to topple the Greek
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get into any of the detail, why don't you just
                        run through the succession of posts that you had.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>BLOOD: Okay. First post was Thessaloniki; then Munich, Germany; then back to
                    Greece to Athens; then to Algiers after a mid-career course at the Foreign
                    Service Institute. Then after a very brief stay in Algiers, my position was
                    eliminated, and I was transferred to Bonn. From Bonn, I returned to the State
                    Department for four and a half years, half of which was in the Executive
                    Secretariat, and half of which was as the Cyprus desk officer. I then went out
                    to Dacca.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year is that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: In 1960. That was my first exposure to South Asia was the assignment to
                    Dacca as political officer and deputy principal officer in the consulate general
                    there. After two years, I was assigned to the Army War College as a student.
                    Then I went to Personnel and headed up the NEA branch in assignments. From
                    there, I went to Afghanistan to Kabul as deputy chief of mission. After three
                    years, I was assigned as political counselor in Athens.</p>
                <p>I was there not quite two years and was transferred directly to Dacca again, East
                    Pakistan, as consul general. There I was caught up in the Bangladesh crisis and
                    spent less than two years, returning to Personnel, where I was for about two and
                    a half years and then went to the Army War College as deputy commandant for
                    international affairs. I spent three and a half years there waiting out Dr.
                    Kissinger's departure from the State Department and then went to New Delhi as
                    deputy chief of mission.</p>
                <p>While in New Delhi I also, at the Department's request, went up to Kabul again to
                    take over the embassy briefly while the—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In which year was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: This was 1979, October-November '79, just weeks before the Soviet
                    invasion. And when I left New Delhi in the end of September 1981 and returned to
                    Washington, I agreed to go again to Afghanistan as charg� and was studying Dari
                    at the Foreign Service Institute preparing to go out there in February of 1982,
                    but the communist government of Afghanistan refused to issue me a visa and that
                    assignment fell through. In May of 1982, I retired from the Foreign Service and
                    subsequently ended up at Allegheny College as diplomat in residence and visiting
                    professor of political science.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good. Now, let's go back to the beginning. When you joined
                        the Foreign Service, I wonder if you give us some of your impressions of the
                        forty people who joined—or the thirty-nine who joined—with you and the group
                        that you immediately came to know. What kind of Service was it? Was it much
                        different from what it is today, or how would you characterize the people
                        who were with you in that group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, first of all, it was an all-male class. All white. Some very, very
                    able people. Hermann Eilts was later ambassador in Saudi Arabia and Egypt was a
                    member of that class. There was a lot of considerable talent in that group, and
                    it was a group in which I was very proud to be associate with from the very
                    beginning. At the same time, there were in that class, several people who struck
                    me as outright jerks who—and I wondered how they had gotten in. I suppose they
                    had done well on the exams, but I couldn't imagine how they had passed the
                    screening of the oral. And in two cases I have in mind, both of those officers
                    were out of the Service within two years for various reasons such as falling in
                    love with the daughters of communist officials or other unacceptable acts.</p>
                <p>But it was an exciting time to be entering the Foreign Service, and we knew that
                    the United States was developing responsibilities all over the world. You knew
                    you were in a growth industry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a great deal of area expertise among the people
                        in your group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes there was. Of course, Hermann Eilts himself had spent many years as a
                    youth in the Middle East. Many of them, like Sid Sober, had excellent French or
                    other language. Lee Andorus also had excellent language capabilities. All of us,
                    of course, had been in the military service and had some experiences outside the
                    United States, although mine was confined to Alaska and the Aleutian Islands,
                    but others had spent time in Europe or the Far East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it true that this was the time when people were
                        recruited from the northeastern establishment or was it broadly geographic
                        in its representation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Even then it was broadly geographic. I suppose the majority of our class
                    were from the east coast, but they were—I mean, it was a representative grouping
                    except for the fact that there were no minorities or no—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Women.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Females, women, in that class.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what about the security factor? I mean, this was the
                        time when anti-communism was becoming a very important consideration in
                        government service. Do you recall anybody scrutinizing your records
                        especially closely for leftist leanings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, that came later. That came during the McCarthy period when I was
                    serving in Germany at the time and was very much aware of the witch hunts, you
                    might say, for alleged communists in the Foreign Service. But at the time I
                    entered, we went through security checks but certainly were not aware of
                    anything very extensive or demanding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you were off to Thessaloniki. The Greek civil war was
                        on at that time, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were some of your impressions of political conditions
                        in Greece at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, Thessaloniki, being the main city in the north, was sort of a focal
                    point of the struggle against the guerrillas. We were at one time shelled by the
                    Andartes, as they were called. The town was under curfew virtually the whole
                    time I was there. It was difficult to go very far out of town on the roads
                    because the roads were mined, and you ran into dangers of having your vehicle
                    damaged. The United States military presence there was very small in
                    Thessaloniki. We had, I think, two or three Army officers, and that was all. We
                    also though had a British—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were observers? These American Army officers were
                        observers or were they—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Observers and advisors to the Greek Army. We also had a brigade of British
                    troops there, and there was a rather strong British military presence there and
                    also including some British officers advising the Greek police.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the British engaged in actual fighting against
                        guerrillas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, they were not. Several of the British were killed in the shelling
                    because one of the mortars landed in their area, but they were not engaged in
                    the fighting. Nor were the Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the status of US aid to Greece at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, we had a tremendous aid effort called AMAG, American Mission for Aid
                    to Greece, engaged in a whole range of educational, agricultural, financial
                    activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Military as well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: And military aid, of course, also, yes. Most of that, of course, was
                    centered in Athens, and we were a bit out of that. And let's see. Also, the
                    George Polk murder case was perhaps the most—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the American journalist?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Interesting. The American journalist who arrived in Thessaloniki and had
                    announced—this was in the spring of 1948—and announced that he wanted to
                    establish contact with the leader of the Andartes. He was found murdered
                    subsequently. Later on there was a trial in which several of the recumbents were
                    convicted in absentia of his murder. But the case aroused a great deal of
                    interest in the United States. Wild Bill Donovan was sent over to represent the
                    media and to be sure that the case was investigated. Our consul general, Raleigh
                    Gibson, I think, spent ninety-nine percent of his time on that case. I, myself,
                    was not involved in it at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The allegation is that he was in fact murdered by the
                        Greek rightists who wanted him out of the way and wanted to besmirch the
                        reputation of the communists.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: That's one of the accusations. The government case is—that is, the Greek
                    government case against the communist—is a bit flawed. Recently a book has come
                    out about that written by Edmond Keeley, who was the brother of Robert Keeley
                    who has been our ambassador in Greece, which I think takes a rather skeptical
                    view of the convictions of the Andartes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with Polk at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, I did not except that I was married in Thessaloniki on May 14, 1948,
                    and the next day was leaving for my honeymoon in Italy when his body was
                    discovered, but I kept going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your principal duties? Were you a visa
                        officer?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>BLOOD: I was consular officer so I had—a large part were visas. Also, we had
                    quite a bit of work with seamen, citizenship matters, notarials, regular gamut
                    of consular work. The most interesting perhaps aspect or different aspect to me
                    was the Ministry of the War Fianc�e Act which allowed American servicemen,
                    veterans of World War II, to bring in fianc�es from abroad without reference to
                    the quota. And many Greeks tried to take advantage of this, and we would
                    constantly be dealing with Greek girls who would come in with letters from a
                    young man in the States saying, “I have been working for your uncle in his
                    restaurant, and he showed me your picture, and I have fallen madly in love with
                    you. I want to marry you. Please take this letter to the American consul and get
                    a visa.” So our job was to decide in fact whether this was true love or fraud,
                    and most of the time, we decided it was fraud.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, that's too bad. You probably prevented a lot of real
                        romance.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: I doubt it, I doubt it. When you have a nineteen-year-old boy and a
                    forty-five-year-old Greek woman who have never met, it didn't strike me as an
                    ideal basis for marrying.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the political work in the consulate at that
                        time? I suppose that we were at a virtual state of war with the rebels, we
                        had no contact them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, no, we had no contact with the rebels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How far left did our contacts go in the Greek political
                        spectrum?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, it's hard for me to answer that because I was doing just consular
                    work. The consul general, who was the only one doing political work, was fully
                    engaged with the Polk murder case and the subsequent investigation. We really
                    didn't do any significant political reporting from Thessaloniki.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then after Thessaloniki, you were off to Munich?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: I spent sixteen months there and suddenly received orders in the beginning
                    of March to be in Munich by the end of March. This is 1949. In fact, many of my
                    classmates ended up in Munich administering the displaced persons visa program.
                    We were issuing visas to people who had actually already been screened and
                    approved by the displaced persons program. It was a very routine job, much less
                    interesting than normal visa work. And we didn't even work in the consulate
                    general in Munich. Our section, at least, was stationed at an old German signal
                    corps barrack outside of Munich which was a displaced persons camp.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a law degree when you entered the Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, I did not. I had left law school shortly after entering.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you could have had a law degree.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, for the first few years in your Foreign Service work,
                        you are doing very routine consular work. Did you ever think of leaving the
                        Service at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes, I did, especially when at my fourth post was Algiers I found my—no,
                    my fifth post which was Bonn, I still found myself doing consular work. It
                    wasn't very challenging, and I felt that I had to get out of it. I had done
                    political work in Athens before going to Algiers and enjoyed it very much. And
                    then to find myself doing consular work in Algiers, and when I got to Bonn, I
                    was assigned first as, really, official greeter of the High Commissioner which I
                    took care of visiting Congressmen, officials, and briefed various groups. And
                    then Herbie LaRue, the executive director, asked me to take over the consular
                    section in addition which I did.</p>
                <p>About this time also, the Service was Wristonized. The Foreign Service was
                    expanded when civil servants and staff corps became FSOs. The number of classes
                    in the Foreign Service increased from six to eight. I had just been promoted to
                    FSO-4, I went back to class five from four.</p>
                <p>And about that time, I thought seriously about wondering whether to continue. But
                    then I got a good job in Bonn as civil military relations officer acting as
                    liaison between the Germans and our own military headquarters in Heidelberg. And
                    then from there, went to the Department with good jobs, and from then on, I
                    never had to do any consular work except in a supervisory capacity as the
                    DCM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well, let's go back to Munich for a moment. Anything
                        in that tour that you think worthy of recording for history?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>BLOOD: Not really. I think the DP program was a well-conceived program, and we
                    were bringing in many, many Jews, many Poles, Hungarians, ethnic Germans from
                    eastern Europe, others who had been displaced by the war and were anxious to get
                    to the United States. So in that respect, one felt you were—these people really
                    were desperate to get out of Germany and get to the United States. But it was a
                    mechanistic, very routine program in which you just issued, you know, hundreds
                    of visas a month.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't even have the challenge of determining whether
                        true love was a factor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Not at all, no. Or really no challenge in determining whether or not to
                    give the visa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After Munich, you were back in Athens again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you speak Greek by this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: I had a little Greek, yes. I was assigned to the political section as
                    biographic officer. Actually the interesting reason was—I understand why I got
                    that assignment is that Claiborne Pell, who is now the Chairman of the Senate
                    Foreign Relations Committee and who was a young Foreign Service officer at the
                    time, had been assigned to that but decided to retire from the Foreign Service
                    so that job came open, and I got it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Maybe if you had retired at that point, you'd have been
                        the senator. [Laughter]</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: I would have preferred it. [Laughter]</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, tell us something about your political work in
                        Athens.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes. Well, the job actually developed somewhat differently. I continued to
                    do biographic work, and I enjoyed that thoroughly. In fact, I drafted some very
                    long biographic reports. I was very much taken by the New Yorker profiles and
                    tried to emulate them. I was doing a bit of psychological profiling also in
                    examining Greek political figures. But I was also asked by Ambassador Peurifoy
                    to become the protocol officer of the embassy which I did. That took a great
                    deal of my time. It also meant that I had to look particularly after
                    congressional visits. I also was a liaison with the palace. Any Americans who
                    sought audiences with the king or queen of Greece would have to come to me, and
                    I would intervene on their behalf or discourage them, as the case might be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of relations did we have with the palace at that
                        time? How would you characterize them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Very, very close, very good relationship. The United States ambassador, of
                    course, at that time was really sort of a viceroy in Greece. He sat in on the
                    meetings of the war council. The war with the guerrillas had just concluded, but
                    the United States still was providing massive economic aid, and we were very
                    intimately involved in the political developments in Greece.</p>
                <p>Charlie Yost was the deputy chief of mission at the time. A splendid, splendid
                    officer. I remember one of my delights of that tour was reading his analysis of
                    that labyrinth and very complicated Greek political situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the strength of nationalism among the people that
                        we dealt with in the government, the king and his ministers? Were they
                        uncomfortable with the kind of viceroy role that we exercised?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, I don't think most of them were. I think they accepted it as a benefit
                    to Greece. After all, it was US help which had enabled Greece to defeat the
                    communist threat to the government. Oh, sure, there must have been some who
                    objected to the heavy US role, but it certainly didn't come from the palace nor
                    do I think from the leading political groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Intellectuals and journalists were—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, some of them, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. Anything you would like to recall from that period,
                        any incident?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>BLOOD: No. It was a very, very busy two years. And also my family increased from
                    one to three in that two years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Cyprus a problem at that stage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: It was just beginning to be. I remember with another officer from the
                    political section going downtown to watch a demonstration by Greeks concerning
                    Cyprus and sort of getting pushed around by the police as a result of our being
                    on the fringes of the crowd. It was just beginning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just beginning.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right. Then after Greece, you were off to
                        Algiers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, I first spent four months in Washington at what used to be called
                    the mid-career course. It certainly wasn't the mid point of my career, thank
                    goodness. But it was a four-month course in which we . . . Most of us had been
                    in the Foreign Service for four or five years, and we had a chance to study and
                    discuss various issues. And I think it was interesting. Not a terribly
                    well-conceived course and not very challenging, but I welcomed the chance to see
                    my colleagues again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The people that you met in that course from service around
                        the world, how did you size them up? Were you still pleased with the quality
                        in the Foreign Service that you saw in them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: That group was not as impressive a group as my initial class was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why is that? Was it because of the Wristonization had
                        brought in people from the staff corps?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, this was still before Wristonization.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>BLOOD: But there were some staff corps people in it. But it was an interesting
                    group. I was still, I would say, impressed by the quality of the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you are off to Algiers after this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Algiers. Consular officer which I think the interesting explanation that
                    Personnel gave me to for the Algiers assignment: I had applied for Russian
                    language training, and I had also expressed an interest in a French-speaking
                    post on the Mediterranean. The idea of trying to get my French into better
                    shape. And so I was assigned to Algiers which is, of course, a French-speaking
                    post on the Mediterranean.</p>
                <p>And I asked them why Algiers which was then part of the EUR bureau since Algiers
                    was a part of France. And I was, even then, thought of myself as an NEA ham. And
                    they said, “Well, you'd applied for Russian training and Algiers is part of EUR.
                    And if we want to get you for Russian, it's easier to get you if you are serving
                    in a European post.” Which didn't strike me as a very good rationale.</p>
                <p>But I was in Algiers only four months because within two months, the new
                    Eisenhower Administration had come in, and they decided that the Foreign Service
                    was over-staffed. And I think it was called Stassenization program, which was a
                    massive cutting back of positions. There were several officers in our—staff
                    officers—they had been formerly in the Foreign Service auxiliary during the war
                    who were actually terminated. My job was terminated, but since I was an FSO, I
                    wasn't fired. I was transferred to Bonn.</p>
                <p>But it was a very stupid program because within months, literally, before the end
                    of the year, the officers who had been terminated, who had been sent back at
                    government expense to the United States with their household effects, were
                    invited to reapply for the Foreign Service again because they needed more
                    people. It was a very, very wasteful way of making the political show of cutting
                    back on the size of the Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was not just the Service that felt the effect. It was a
                        government-wide RIF at that time, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes. Of course, we were concerned only with the impact then on the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So then you went to Bonn where you . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>BLOOD: I went to Bonn as chief of official reception; that was my title. I
                    replaced an officer who was a staff officer who had been hired in Germany. He
                    had been there at the end of the war and kept on. In fact, most of staff then
                    were people who were not Foreign Service officers, and they rather resented
                    those of us who were coming into Germany because we were displacing these
                    people. I quickly found out that that job which had been billed to me as a
                    tremendously important job was a job that took maybe one-fourth of my time. I
                    asked for other work, and they made me briefing officer. I briefed really groups
                    that weren't important enough for more senior officers to brief. And then I also
                    took over the consular section in addition.</p>
                <p>But it was a strange post at that time because it was so large, and the FSOs
                    were, at least initially when I got there, a minority. I was the only FSO in the
                    administrative section at the time. Most of the others were in the political or
                    economic section. But this changed over the period I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After a stint in consular work, you went in the political
                        section to do . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, yes. Herbie LaRue, who was the executive director, promised me that
                    if I took over the consular section that he would see that I got a good job. And
                    he lived up to that. I became the civil military officer working in the
                    political section but primarily responsible for liaison with the US Army
                    headquarters in Heidelberg.</p>
                <p>Part of the job then was to work with the Germans and our Army in turning over US
                    Army facilities to the Germans who were then building up their own defense
                    forces. We were turning over assets, that is, barracks, training grounds, all
                    sorts of facilities that used to belong to the German Army and which had been
                    taken over by the US Army. I found that a very . . . The Germans we worked with
                    at that time did not yet have a defense ministry—were very, very able, and it
                    was interesting working with the army. Most of it was done by telephone.</p>
                <p>Then when I left, the Army set up a liaison section in Bonn composed of several
                    colonels and lieutenant colonels who handled that function. But when I did it, I
                    did it by myself and was doing it as an FSO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But your relationship was with the German military not the
                        German foreign ministry at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, it was not with the German military. It was with German civilians who
                    were running this office called Dienstelle Blanc, named after a gentleman named
                    Blanc. But it was essentially a logistics—it was sort of the G-4 of the
                    incipient German armed forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But who staffed it? Were they ex-German military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, I think a lot of them had been in the military. Of course, most
                    Germans had been in the military. But at the time, the leaders that I dealt with
                    were actually civilians, German civilians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And American military on the other side?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: And American military on the other side, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any reflections from that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, of course, it was in Bonn when Wristonization occurred, when I was
                    serving in Bonn. And at first, I was very disillusioned, disappointed, when I
                    saw people running the motor pool and others coming in at grades senior to mine.
                    But then over the years as I reflected on it, I realized that this actually
                    turned out to be an advantage to younger Foreign Service officers like myself
                    because the number of jobs in the Foreign Service increased, and we were—it
                    sounds immodest, but it's certainly true—the FSOs were many notches ahead in
                    ability of most of these people who were brought in. In the competition, we
                    could easily out-distance them so it did create more promotional opportunities
                    for us in the long run. But in the short run, it seemed like a very rough
                    blow.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was also the period that you mentioned
                        witch-hunting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, yes. Cohn and Schine, McCarthy's hatchet men, had visited Bonn just
                    before I got there, and the post was still reverberating from that. I remember
                    the questions that the security people would ask. For instance, of course,
                    anybody who had served in China was automatically suspect and a target of
                    investigation. There was a young officer there who was actually the High
                    Commissioner's special assistant. Very able fellow who had served in China as
                    his first post. And I remember being queried by security about him. Questions
                    such as, “Does he read the New York Times?” The New York Times was considered by
                    the security people as a leftist newspaper. And I was young enough to say, “Yes,
                    I hope to hell he does.”</p>
                <p>It was fearsome because also there were many allegations of homosexuality. A good
                    friend of mine who I'm sure had—I'm positive had—was completely innocent of the
                    account was accused by some clerk in the embassy. The security approach to
                    this—the SY approach to this—was just so obnoxious. Everybody was assumed guilty
                    until proven innocent that he resigned from the Foreign Service.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>But a lot of people who were sensitive were, I think, so taken aback by the
                    techniques employed then that, even though innocent, they left the Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the young aid to the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: He unfortunately died of a disease within a couple of years later. But his
                    promotions I believe were held up, and his career was adversely affected solely
                    because he had been in China.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the senior officers in the embassy attempt to control
                        this phenomena?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, they did not. That's the tragic part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They did not because they were afraid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: They were afraid. That was an eyeopener to many of us to see that people
                    would not stand up. There were a couple of exceptions, but in most cases, people
                    did not stand up very vigorously for personnel who were under accusation even
                    though they knew full well that the accusations were false. Yet, people were
                    reluctant to risk their own careers because if they stood up, they were likely
                    to become targets of an investigation.</p>
                <p>I remember, too, we had—again, Herbie LaRue, the exec director, had decided to
                    form an American Legion post there. Many people were put under very great
                    pressure, including myself, to join which I refused to do even though he held up
                    my efficiency report for a good while and kept saying, “Well, you know, have you
                    thought about joining the American Legion?”</p>
                <p>I said, “No. I thought about it, but I refuse to do it.” I said, “It's just too
                    big a club. I don't like most of the positions they take, and I'm not going to
                    join.”</p>
                <p>He didn't actually punish me in the efficiency report. He made me sweat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were your promotions going at this stage? Were you
                        coming along in reasonable progress?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Actually back in Munich I got the first one. That was early. Then it
                    slowed up. And it wasn't until many years later in the State Department when I
                    had a chance to review my file that I found that in Bonn I had been given a
                    overall rating of two minus by an inspection team.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Two minus being?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Two minus being the lowest I've ever heard of. I mean, I think—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On a scale of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, six would have been about the top, but two minus was extremely low.
                    They had asked me questions that said, “Don't you think that this would be a
                    good way of doing this?”</p>
                <p>And I said, “No, I didn't think it was.” The only reason that I could think of
                    was I thought they were putting forth silly ideas to see if I would just agree
                    with them. Instead, I decided—perhaps in retrospect maybe they thought they were
                    good ideas; I didn't, and I disagreed with them. But I think that rating
                    probably held me back for a little while, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was an inspector's rating.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: An inspector's rating, yes. Oh, the regular ratings were okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was when officers—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: In those days, the inspectors did ratings on everybody, and those ratings
                    were usually lower than the regular ratings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That changed subsequently.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, yes, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Quite the reverse, wasn't it true later on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: It did, yes. Also, inspectors didn't rate everybody - only those who were
                    on probationary status or up for tenure or in certain categories. But normally
                    they didn't rate everybody. And usually what they did, they were sort of bland
                    and favorable. But in the old days, the inspectors' ratings could be quite
                    rough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then after you left Bonn, you came back to
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>BLOOD: I came back to Washington and was assigned to the executive
                    secretariat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Secretary being John Foster Dulles.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: John Foster Dulles was the Secretary. Christian Herter was the Under
                    Secretary at that time. And our job in the secretariat, of course, was to
                    basically handle the paperwork coming up to the Secretary and the Under
                    Secretary and then down from them.</p>
                <p>I started off as what was called the global briefing officer giving briefings to
                    various groups that came to the Department. I remember I had a map, and I would
                    take them around the world. And it was forbidden to say anything about China. I
                    could talk about Taiwan and the Republic of China and our close relations with
                    them but not to say a single word about the Chinese mainland.</p>
                <p>Then, subsequently, I became the editor of the top secret staff summary which is
                    a two or three-page summary of the most important cables prepared every work
                    morning and is on the desk of the Secretary and the President at eight o'clock
                    in the morning. This meant I had to get up at two in the morning, get down the
                    Department at three. I had two other officers working for me. We all three would
                    read cables, and I would pick the cables that would be summarized, and they
                    would summarize them, and we would make up the summary.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, I got caught up in this. This was 1956 when the Hungarian crisis
                    and the Suez crisis were running concurrently. So I was stuck on that job for
                    four months straight, which is a little long because it is a very demanding job.
                    I would then work until about two in the afternoon doing my regular work, go
                    home, try to get some sleep in the summer which was very hard, and then get up
                    again for dinner. Then I would go back to bed, get four hours sleep before going
                    down at two o'clock in the morning. Many times I was not aware when I woke up
                    whether I was getting up to go to work or not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with Mr. Dulles or the other
                        principals in the Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes, I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your impressions?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, also I should say before that, that the contact mostly came because
                    then I moved into the line which is what we called the line; that is, the
                    officers who took care of seeing the paperwork coming up. We divided it by
                    bureaus. I had EUR and the Public Affairs Bureau primarily and a few others that
                    didn't amount to very much in terms of paperwork like the Historical Division.
                    When Secretary Dulles wanted something, we would send down the request, we were
                    responsible for getting it back on time, be sure that it was correct, clear, and
                    all. And, also, the officers on the line at that time served as the Departmental
                    duty officers. We didn't have a operations center then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So if there were a crisis in Europe, you had to . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, no, those of us on the line were the duty officers, the only duty
                    officers for the Department. This was very demanding particularly on weekends.
                    Secretary Dulles liked his privacy. Even assistant secretaries who wanted to
                    contact him had to call us. So I would get phone calls at home or on Saturday
                    morning from people saying they had to see the Secretary. It was difficult as a
                    young officer to make the decision when you were going to call John Foster
                    Dulles and say, “Somebody wants to see you,” or not. Or you just say, “I'm sorry
                    I can't give out his number,” and try to refer them to somebody else.</p>
                <p>Also, in those days, if you had an eyes-only cable for the Secretary that came in
                    over the weekend, you went down to the Department and got it. And in your own
                    car, you drove over to the Secretary's house and delivered it to him and waited
                    there while he read it and gave you instructions as to what to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your impressions of Mr. Dulles at this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: First of all, it troubled me that he knew more about the details of the
                    business of the State Department than did most of the senior Foreign Service
                    officers with whom he was dealing. As the EUR man, I would routinely be invited
                    to the briefing sessions with the Secretary that preceded the visit say of the
                    French prime minister or the German chancellor, whoever. And I was struck that
                    in these meetings when questions came up about details, say, “What does the
                    treaty of Rome say?” or this or that, that almost without exception, the
                    Secretary knew the answer.</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>The senior Foreign Service people said, “I don't know. I'll look it up.” He, who
                    is really more on top of the situation—there were exceptions like—oh, what's his
                    name? [Livingston Merchant?] He was director of European regional affairs at the
                    time. He could match the Secretary in his command of facts. But most of the
                    others couldn't. That disturbed me. I mean, certainly the Secretary was very
                    able, very hard working. But it seemed to me that professionals in the
                    Department ought to be able to, in their own field—because the Secretary was
                    concerned with areas throughout the world not just Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he a charitable man when he confronted such
                        inadequacies?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Not too charitable. Also, the other impression I had he was quite
                    inarticulate but in the sense that he answered many questions with grunts. There
                    were people who had worked with him, you know, more closely than I who could
                    interpret these grunts, but I found it very difficult when he would look at me
                    and grunt. And I would normally have to whisper to somebody, “What does he
                    want?”</p>
                <p>And they would say, “He wants two copies of this,” or something like that.</p>
                <p>And I would go out and get it. But he was not given at all to any small talk or
                    social niceties. All business.</p>

                <p>BLOOD: Eleanor?</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes, she was. She was, in fact, the director of German affairs then. She
                    was a rather formidable lady. The advice I was given was stay away from her,
                    which I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think she was held back by the fact that she was a
                        woman?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, no, I don't. Well, of course, would she have been where she was if she
                    was not the Secretary's sister?</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, Mr. Herter was the complete opposite from John Foster Dulles. When I
                    went to Mr. Dulles' home to deliver things, he would just look at me and grunt
                    and take it. When I went to Mr. Herter when he was acting Secretary or Under
                    Secretary, he was a soul of courtesy. “Please come in. Won't you have a cup of
                    coffee.” A gracious gentleman who was in all situations a gentleman. Really a
                    fine person to I think all of us who served there. And actually Herbert Hoover
                    Junior was the Under Secretary at first. Both of them were extremely gracious
                    and very well thought of, I mean, warmly by the staff.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude of Mr. Dulles and his associates
                        towards the professional Foreign Service? You say they weren't charitable,
                        but did they look on the Service as someone who got in the way, potentially
                        disloyal? How did they . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, the Foreign Service always fares better when you have a strong
                    Secretary of State. Well, not always in the case of Kissinger. But normally they
                    would because the Secretary of State is important. John Foster Dulles was,
                    without a doubt, the principal foreign policy advisor to President Eisenhower. I
                    think he used the Department and the Foreign Service well. I think the morale
                    was, I recall it, quite high. We felt we were in an important department,
                    working for somebody who was very, very influential and that the work was
                    recognized.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes, by then, that had ended. I think nobody was happy with the way that
                    Dulles or even President Eisenhower had handled that situation, but that had
                    disappeared. The Department was a very, very vital force.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: I spent two years in the secretariat. Then I went to NEA. Probably my
                    favorite job of all in the Foreign Service. I became the first Cyprus desk
                    officer.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is 19—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: This would have been 1958. Cyprus, of course, didn't achieve independence
                    until 1960. It was still a British colony. There was an insurrection going on in
                    Cyprus of the EOKA, the Greek Cypriots trying to achieve union of Cyprus and
                    Greece. Many negotiations with Greece, with Turkey, and the British. It was
                    coming up in the U.N. brought by the Greeks every year.</p>
                <p>The great part about it—I was a class four officer then—was that I was the only
                    person I think in Washington who was solely concerned with Cyprus. There were,
                    of course, many people above me who were partially concerned with it. But all
                    the policy papers and virtually everything, I drafted. It could be changed, as
                    they often were, but it was a feeling of responsibility, sort of a focused
                    responsibility. It was such a challenging job. I was dealing with the British,
                    Greek, Turkish embassies. It was a great job.</p>
                <p>GTI—that was the office of Greek-Turkish-Iranian Affairs in NEA which has now
                    been subsequently transferred to European Affairs. And that was a great office.
                    Tremendous people in it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was in charge?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Owen T. Jones was the director, and Mennen Williams was deputy director.
                    Bruce Laingen and I shared an office. I was the Cyprus officer; he was the Greek
                    desk officer. Then, of course, when he was away or on vacation, I also handled
                    Greece. And when I was away, he handled Cyprus. And then Roy Atherton
                    subsequently became, when I left the job, the Cyprus desk officer.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Secretary seized of the Cyprus problem at that
                        time period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, he was not. The people we did work with primarily were Bill
                    Rountree—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the assistant Secretary?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Assistant secretary for NEA. Bill Dale who was then director of British
                    affairs in EUR. Bob Murphy who was—</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Under Secretary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: The Under Secretary for Political Affairs. And he was the one that the
                    Greeks and the Turks would come to, particularly the Greek ambassador would see
                    him. The Secretary and the Under Secretary rarely got involved in Cyprus. I
                    think, as I recall, Bob Murphy was really the senior most person with whom I
                    dealt on Cyprus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, what was the US trying to accomplish at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, we were trying to, of course, bring about a negotiated settlement of
                    the Cyprus problem that would secure our military concerns in the area and not
                    upset Turkey too much. We were trying to block, the time I was there, the Greek
                    efforts to use United Nations General Assembly to sort of try to force some
                    action with respect to Cyprus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We favored an independent Cyprus eventually.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Eventually we did, but we didn't start off that way. I remember drawing up
                    a plan myself that called for enosis of Cyprus with Greece with Turkish bases on
                    the island.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But was that—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: That didn't get very far either. I've always thought that the Greeks
                    misplayed the Cyprus—Makarios particularly, the Greek Cypriot leader misplayed
                    the Cyprus issue. If they had—and this is my own theory—if they had accepted the
                    early British offers for limited self-government and had not—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Under British sovereignty.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, yes, initially under British sovereignty, but the British were doing
                    this throughout the world, and everywhere it was leading to independence. At
                    this time, the guerrilla, the Eoka guerrilla movement, had not begun. The Turk
                    Cypriots were sort of quiescent and relaxed. And I think if they had done that,
                    accepted the British offers, that eventually and gradually just like in many
                    places of the world, and without Turkish resistance, Cyprus would have become
                    part of Greece. But the resistance sort of—</p>

                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were talking about Cyprus. Would you continue where I
                        interrupted you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: All right. The Greek Cypriot resistance worried and antagonized the
                    Turkish Cypriots and then the Turkish government. When the Turkish government
                    became intimately involved, the problem became much more intractable. The chance
                    for enosis; that is, union of Cyprus with Greece, which I always had favored
                    myself, disappeared.</p>
                <p>The key event, in my own analysis, in the move toward independence was the defeat
                    of the Greek effort at the United Nations in November of 1959. The Greeks had
                    made the mistake of allowing Krishna Menon of India to stage manage their
                    effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Our position was against the Greek initiative. We were getting many
                    telegrams from Greek-Americans throughout the country urging us to support
                    Greece in the United Nations. The queen of Greece, Queen Frederika, had a very
                    long-standing letter writing relationship with George Marshall, who was, of
                    course, retired by then. But she was pressing him to intervene on behalf of
                    Greece. And the Queen and the palace, particularly the Queen, was also
                    approaching White House and other people trying to get the United States to
                    change position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Greek position being move to enosis and union with
                        Cyprus. Am I incorrect on that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, that was the Greeks' ultimate goal, yes. I forget exactly the
                    technical nature of their proposal in the General Assembly. It wasn't that bold,
                    but it was leading in that direction.</p>
                <p>I also recall it was Bob Murphy who held the line in a rather key decision not to
                    go along with the Greeks even though Henry Cabot Lodge, who was our ambassador
                    to the U.N., was urging that we accept the Greek position. Our feeling was that
                    if the Greeks realized that they couldn't get anywhere in the U.N., then they
                    would be forced into negotiations with the Turks and the British. And we wanted
                    to stop, once and for all, the U.N. effort which had been conducted on a yearly
                    basis. We wanted to make it clear to the Greeks that they better give up this
                    U.N. route and resign themselves to negotiations. After the failure of
                    their—</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a position that the British wanted and we
                        accepted the British argument, or was it something that we independently
                        arrived at?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>BLOOD: I think we independently arrived at it. We had, at that time—our primary
                    contacts were with the Greeks. They were in constantly berating us. The Turks
                    came to see us much less frequently. And the contacts with the British were not
                    as frequent as with the Greeks and the Turks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you don't think at a senior level, there were
                        consultations with the British?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, there were. Of course, we had an excellent consul general in Nicosia.
                    At that time, of course, it was a consulate general, Toby Belcher, who was
                    superb and had a wonderful relationship with Sir N. Harding who later became
                    Lord Carradon. But in Washington, no, I don't think so. And I know that if there
                    had been, I would have known about it because whenever the Secretary and Under
                    Secretary were not involved in Cyprus, Mr. Murphy was. When anybody ever came in
                    to talk Cyprus to him, I was there as the note taker.</p>

                        preoccupied with their own internal affairs, or why didn't they take a more
                        active role? Why did the Turks leave the problem alone at this stage?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, the Turks were playing to their strength. They had won our gratitude
                    in Korea. They were, in terms of military significance to NATO, more important
                    than Greece, and they knew it. And they, I think, sensed that we were probably
                    not going to accede to Greek wishes. They weren't importuning to us to do
                    anything. They were really concerned that we not adopt the Greek point of view;
                    and they knew we weren't, so they were rather relaxed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You indicated earlier that they might have been prepared

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Before the troubles began, yes. And if the Greek Cypriots had not come
                    into active hostility with the British. If the offers of limited self-government
                    had been accepted, it could have played out gradually over a period of years
                    without strife or violence. Yes, I think they would have accepted that.</p>

                <p>BLOOD: Not very significant, really. They were always behind the curve in the
                    sense that the cables which we would receive asking us to vote for the Greek
                    resolutions in the General Assembly would usually arrive at the State Department
                    after the vote had been taken. And we were, therefore, able to send off a

                <p>BLOOD: At that time, the Greek lobby was not as sufficient as it later came to
                    be. There were a few congressmen—I remember John Brademas of Indiana, who is now
                    president of NYU—who was interested. But even then, he was very sympathetic to
                    all the other considerations and not blindly in support of Greece. In fact, we
                    discounted the Greek-American pressure and could afford to do so.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, you had people like Tom Pappas who was a wealthy Greek-American from
                    Boston close to President Eisenhower, but their lobbying efforts weren't really
                    well focused.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how long did you have this job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: I had it for two and a half years, and then I left to go out to Dacca in
                    the summer of '62.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes, but remember that NEA Bureau ran from Greece to Dacca. So I was still
                    within my bureau, I was just in a different area of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did you seek that assignment? Was that your choice to
                        go to Dacca?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No. Well, they offered me a comparable job in Madras or Dacca. I thought
                    that Dacca seemed more interesting because the consulate general there was
                    separated from the embassy by over a thousand miles, and it would be more of an
                    independent post.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what was your job in Dacca?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>BLOOD: In Dacca, I was political officer and also deputy principal officer. That
                    second aspect became more important.</p>
                <p>My consul general there was Nat B. King, who really didn't like the management
                    functions of the job particularly. And particularly when he wrote efficiency
                    reports, he said, “I've only known this officer for a year, and I'm really not
                    in the position to make any judgment.” I told him that he was crucifying
                    officers by statements like this even though he didn't intend to do so.</p>
                <p>So I volunteered to write all the efficiency reports for his review just to
                    protect the officers. And I did so. He allowed me to do more and more of this so
                    I became sort of a baby DCM in the consulate general which to me made the job
                    more interesting than doing the straight political work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the political work like at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, in large part, it was reporting the grievances of the Bengalis
                    against the government of Pakistan and against West Pakistanis. This annoyed
                    Washington because Washington liked to believe that Pakistan was a stable,
                    united country. Ayub was then president of Pakistan. Popular in the United
                    States, but not popular in East Pakistan. We were aware, as I was aware later on
                    at my second tour in Dacca of course, that we were preaching a message that
                    wasn't very popular. But everybody who served in Dacca has been so struck by the
                    obvious fact of this unhappiness that we all reported.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, in East Pakistan the government of the region was
                        appointed by the West Pakistan authorities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: The governor was appointed. That was Ahsum Kandu, who actually was very
                    popular.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a Bengali?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, he was not Bengali, he was a general. But he had a falling out with
                    Ayub and was replaced. He was the key official. The next most important official
                    would be the general office commanding; that is, commanding the Pakistan
                    military. And we actually became very close friends with him.</p>
                <p>At that time, we had very good cordial relations with the Pakistani military and
                    with the West Pakistani authorities as well as with the Bengalis.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And no one hesitated to talk to you, I suppose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Nobody hesitated to talk. The Pakistanis were more circumspect than say
                    Greeks would be about talking politics. But you had open access.</p>
                <p>The problem there was we had a large AID mission. The AID mission director in
                    Karachi, which was still then the embassy, had much more access to the
                    leadership of Pakistan than did our ambassador. In East Pakistan, the director
                    of the AID mission had more access to the governor than did the consul general.
                    There was considerable friction between the two. AID was, in those days, a big
                    dominant organization which threw its weight around a lot. That was one of the
                    sort of irritating aspects of that job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you say Washington wasn't happy with your reporting
                        on grievances.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, they never objected openly, but . . . For instance, we had been
                    reporting that Ayub was unpopular, that Ahsum, the governor, however, was
                    popular and perhaps his popularity might lead to his removal because the
                    president might consider him a rival. And in the summer of 1961, a young
                    American came over to East Pakistan on a Farm Bureau exchange, and he worked in
                    a Bengali farm for a while. When he came back to Washington, he was debriefed,
                    and he said, “Ayub was wildly popular in East Pakistan, but they don't like
                    Ahsum.”</p>
                <p>The desk sent me a cable saying, “Well, we've got this information. What do you
                    think of that?”</p>
                <p>And I was so teed off by it that I refused to answer it because, I mean, here is
                    this one young man in the country in the wake of years of steady reporting to
                    the country. But it just struck me that they were grasping at straws. Finally,
                    somebody had told them what they wanted to hear, and they were trying to latch
                    on to it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you had contact with these unhappy Bengalis, did the
                        West Pakistani authorities either in Dacca or back at Karachi complain about
                        your activities in talking to their opposition?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: As I recall, they did occasionally. I think we all were aware we had to be
                    rather circumspect in our dealings. I was put in sometimes a difficult position
                    by Mr. Suhrawardy, who had been prime minister of Pakistan and who been the
                    leader of the Awami League but was sort of in retirement and no longer an
                    important political figure. He would call me at home and say, “Let's go to the
                    movies or let's do this or that.”</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>And I would try to have to fend him off because I realized that if I were seen in
                    public with him, it would be embarrassing. I mean, the Pakistan government
                    wouldn't like it, and it could be embarrassing to the US. And besides, at that
                    time he was really not that significant enough a figure to warrant the risk.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the consulate general's relationship with the
                        embassy a thousand miles away?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Miserable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, that's true of every consul general with every
                        embassy, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes, but these were even worse.</p>
                <p>Well, I really probably shouldn't say this but Nat King would—his wife had never
                    come out to Dacca. Oh, he kept saying she would join him; she was living in
                    Switzerland. He was, I think, lonely. And he took to drinking. And he would call
                    me on Sunday afternoon and show me a cable he was sending to the embassy chewing
                    them out for this or that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of this or that? Failure to provide
                        administrative support?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Support, often that. Sometimes policy guidance but mostly on
                    administrative and housing matters and things like that. I knew that it wouldn't
                    do any good, and it would just get him into trouble. So my job was, I felt, to
                    talk him out of sending this cable which I would nearly always succeed in doing,
                    but it took about an hour and a half of a Sunday afternoon getting him out of
                    this mood. He was very, very irritated with the embassy, and they knew it. I was
                    sort of a buffer in a way. But I liked Nat, and he was good to me. I was really
                    trying to protect him from actions I knew would just get the embassy angrier and
                    angrier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the AID mission? You say they had more access.
                        Did they respond to directions, suggestions on how to conduct
                        themselves?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Not very well. The AID mission director was not a very impressive fellow.
                    A fellow who had been, I think, a sergeant in the Army, in the military, and had
                    come up through sort of their administrative ranks. He was not an economist. He
                    was very concerned with his own position.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>I mean, AID for instance lived so much better than the rest of us lived. They all
                    had air-conditioners in every room of their house and air-conditioned
                    automobiles. We didn't. It was sort of a two-class society in East Pakistan. The
                    Foreign Service and the USIA and CIA were sort of the lower class, and AID was
                    the upper class.</p>

                <p>BLOOD: Oh, they were well received, yes, because they were distributing large
                    amounts of assistance.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No. They were small. There were only two officers there and a secretary.
                    We worked very closely with them. Never any friction there.</p>

                <p>BLOOD: No, there could be communal disturbances, you know. If one occurred in
                    India say with the Hindus taking out after the Muslims, it would almost
                    automatically within a few days be some incident in East Pakistan with Muslims
                    going after the minority Hindus or vice versa. That was the only—of course, the
                    Indians were very suspect by the Pak authorities, but we tried to maintain
                    contact with the Indian high commissioner, close contact.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, no, not really. I think the Bengalis, of course, felt that they were
                    not getting a fair shake. They thought they were being treated as a colony. They
                    were contributing the bulk of the foreign exchange earned by Pakistan, but they
                    were getting, what, maybe a third of the foreign exchange to spend. They were
                    getting, well, less than half of the development funds. Key positions in the
                    civil service and in the military were held by West Pakistanis. They thought
                    that they were just being milked by Pakistan.</p>

                    were just voicing their grievances, primarily economic grievances. And they were
                    justified, I think, when you consider that over half the population of Pakistan
                    was in East Pakistan, but the West Pakistan was much more prosperous. The
                    businesses in East Pakistan were controlled primarily by West Pakistanis.</p>

                <p>BLOOD: It was my first introduction to South Asia, and we were able to travel
                    quite a bit in East Pakistan. We got up also to Kashmir and Nepal from there to
                    Calcutta. In those days, we could go frequently to Calcutta. Calcutta was the
                    big city, and you could fly over there in half an hour. I think it was that
                    experience that sort of really piqued my interest in South Asia and made me keen
                    on returning when I had an opportunity to do so.</p>

                    It seemed possibly manageable. There were lots of AID projects under way. The
                    atmosphere, despite the grumblings of the Bengalis, was one of progress and
                    hope, yes. I didn't come away, you know, discouraged about East Pakistan. I came
                    away troubled about the relationship with West Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And still positive about the relationship with the State
                        Department in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, yes. Oh, yes. We had really no problems with the Department. In fact,
                    I had no problems with the embassy at all. Just the consul general did, but I
                    didn't. They never objected to anything we said.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you were back to Washington again, or was that . .
                        .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: I went to the Army War College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: For a year as a student. Enjoyed that very much. There was one other
                    Foreign Service officer, Bob Moore, who spent most of his time in East Asia.</p>
                <p>Then at the end of that assignment, actually I was . . . There were two
                    assignments offered. One was—I'm glad I didn't pick now—political counselor in
                    Kabul. And the other was to be head of the NEA branch in Personnel. And I took
                    that job and glad I did. That was another—Cyprus was probably the best job, and
                    maybe that NEA branch in Personnel was probably maybe the next best job.</p>
                <p>We had an excellent staff. Earl Sloan was the head of the office. Bob Donhauser
                    was deputy head. I had EUR—I mean, NEA. Charlie Whitehouse had Africa. Cleo Noel
                    had East Asia. Bob Brown, who became inspector general later, had EUR. Pierre
                    Graham, ambassador to Guinea I think later on, had Latin America. It was a great
                    office.</p>
                <p>Of course, then, as later, the assignments were made in panel. And those were
                    really fun sessions. It was a negotiating job. I mean, we are negotiating with
                    the bureaus, with the officers, other bureaus all the time. It was a very live
                    wire office, I think, with the—</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, you assigned me to Alexandria, as a matter of fact.
                        So you—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: And, of course, it paid off in the sense that I was really working not
                    only for Personnel, but I was working for the executive director in NEA, Joe
                    Eggert. And he was the one who said, “Boy, the job you ought to look for at the
                    end of two years here is the DCM job in Kabul.” And he was on my side. I zeroed
                    in on that, and luckily I was promoted to class two that winter in time to
                    qualify for the job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in 19—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: This would have been 1965.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '65. So you went on to Kabul that summer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: That summer, yes. Things were going very well. And that was a great—John
                    Steeves was the ambassador. He was the one that picked me. Kabul was a
                    tremendous post. It was probably the best time to be there because it was more
                    open. The country was more open to foreigners than it had been before. We could
                    travel a great deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the roads paved at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, actually, the circumferential, you might say, highway net in
                    Afghanistan is better than in Iran or in Pakistan or India.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it existed at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, yes, yes. Well, we were building—most of it existed. Part of it was
                    the road we were—while I was there, we finished the road from Kabul to Kandahar,
                    but large parts of it were done.</p>
                <p>Of course, we had an attach� plane, and we could use that for travel. The Afghan
                    government was sensitive to that plane going to northern Afghanistan toward the
                    Soviet border, and they would only allow it to go if the ambassador or myself
                    were on board which meant that the air attach� for his own business was
                    constantly asking us, “Can't you think of some reason to go up to Mazar-e Sharif
                    or Qonduz?” And we often did. Sometimes we would take our British colleagues or
                    German colleagues along with us on the flight. It was a great way to travel.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the Afghan government was sensitive because they
                        didn't want to provoke the Soviets?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: That's right, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it easy to talk to Afghans at that time? Could you
                        talk to university people and other non-governmental people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: It was. I mean, I think that Afghan officials still, in particular the
                    military—I mean, the military would go to the attach�'s house, but they wouldn't
                    come to our house. I think the Afghan officials were a little nervous about
                    showing up and say going to foreign embassies or foreign residences. But we had
                    a lot of contact with Afghans.</p>
                <p>Of course, again we had a very large AID mission with a network of relationships
                    throughout the education world, the government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they speak frankly to you about their political views,
                        these Afghans that you met?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes, but at that time the king was starting his sort of a halfhearted
                    democratization program, parliamentary election. I don't think the issues
                    weren't that burning. I mean, it struck us at the time as a calm period. I mean,
                    now of course, the communist party was established then. But in those first
                    couple of years, it was pretty small potatoes.</p>
                <p>Our relations with the Soviets were remarkable in that—I've never been in a post
                    where you had as friendly relations with Soviets as we had in Kabul in those
                    days. The Afghans, of course, encouraged that.</p>
                <p>We had what we called Soviet-American bashes. About once a month, several
                    American officers would get together with several Russian officers for dinner, a
                    lot of drinking, and bantering back and forth. We would deliberately introduce
                    our junior officers to this one at a time so they could get an idea how clever
                    these guys were and how able they were. Of course, most of the Soviets we were
                    dealing with were KBG types, but they had good sense of humor, very sharp, very
                    sharp. And that was part of our purpose. To let our junior officers know how
                    sharp they were. It was done in an atmosphere of camaraderie and
                    conviviality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I suppose we had sort of a condominium relationship with
                        them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, no. They were the top dog.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We didn't have sharp diversity of views on Afghanistan,
                        did we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, no, we didn't. In fact, one of our AID contract groups was working
                    with the finance ministry and, you know, how they would work. Say, the Russians
                    would aid one sector of the economy, and we would aid a sector so there wouldn't
                    be overlap. And we were working well this way. They built some roads; we built
                    some roads. We helped out, we built one airport; they built some other airports.
                    And they—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But who did this coordination? We didn't sit down with the
                        Russians and work out this—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, no. The Afghans did the coordination. But with us and with the
                    Russians. We didn't work directly with the Russians on that. But there was, I
                    think, almost a tacit understanding that we accepted the fact that they provided
                    the bulk of all the military aid, more economic aid than any other country, but
                    that our aid gave the Afghans an alternative to sort of complete dependence upon
                    the Soviets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the implications of being top dog to them? What
                        does it mean to them politically? Do they have more access to the king?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, they have more access. It also means that the Afghans wouldn't
                    deliberately antagonize them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they treat them differently from the way we were
                        treated? Any way you can distinguish—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, I can't. I'm not really—it's hard to say because I never saw any of
                    their dealings, but I don't think that they were—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They weren't given greater preferences and seatings at
                        official functions or anything like that?</hi>

                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Nothing obvious.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No. But I think on important issues, say in U.N. votes or action,
                    certainly I think the Afghan government would think very carefully about taking
                    an action that they knew the Soviets wouldn't like.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What attention did Washington pay to Afghanistan at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, in aid terms, quite a bit. I remember that there was another cut, I
                    think, a government cut in that period of '65 to '68. I was surprised to see
                    that Kabul was one of the thirty largest posts in the world because of our AID
                    mission. It was a large AID mission. We had a large Peace Corps contingent
                    there. We had a lot of Americans in Afghanistan and a lot of people on contract
                    there. So in terms of economic assistance, you had within—this is before we
                    really got involved in Egypt, of course—you had Jordan and—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still had a fair program in Iran.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Iran, yes. India. Pakistan was much more important. Jordan was important.
                    India was important. But Afghanistan was up there in the top four or five in
                    NEA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: While there, we had the big Hellman Valley project had been under way for
                    years. It was a large effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did the assistant secretary visit Afghanistan? Who was
                        the assistant secretary at that stage? Was it Luke Battle?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No. Harriman came out on one visit. He was the senior most American I
                    think had came there when I was there. You would get some congressional visits I
                    think largely because looking at the AID program.</p>
                <p>But, no, I think from the political sort of leadership in Washington, there
                    wasn't that much concern.</p>

                <p>BLOOD: No, we had none stationed there. They would come up from Pakistan or India
                    from time to time. It was a relatively quiet period. At least we thought it was
                    at the time.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, not similar. Relationships were better. The ambassadors were able to
                    exercise their authority over the AID missions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had Ambassador Steeves.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What change did you notice between the professional and
                        the political appointee? Any?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, I think, actually, I would say Bob Neumann was a better ambassador
                    than John Steeves. John Steeves was better at working with the American
                    community. He was very likable. He played a lot of bridge. He rode horses. He
                    fished and golfed. I mean, he moved around a lot in the American community. He
                    wasn't as good as a political analyst in dealing with the Afghan government than
                    I think as Neumann was. Neumann was very effective in that. Very hard working.
                    I'd say Neumann was a better ambassador than Steeves.</p>

                <p>BLOOD: I stayed until the end of my tour and then was succeeded by Bruce Laingen.
                    In fact, I was promoted just at the end of the tour to class one. I was doing
                    very well right then. So it was logical that I would move on to something
                    else.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now you are up in the senior ranks of the Foreign Service.
                        What's your opinion of the Foreign Service at this stage? How does it stack
                        up? Still the view that you held in the beginning, that you were in a pretty
                        sharp—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, yes, yes. Things were going extremely well. Work was interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The quality of your associates though you felt was—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: I thought it was still very, very high.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Then came actually, I think, a critical point in my career. I said I was
                    promoted to class one, you know, February or so of 1968, and my tour was coming
                    to an end in the summer. Of course, it was where would I want to go to next. And
                    NEA came forth with some suggestions that didn't—like political counselor in
                    Ankara and Athens that didn't intrigue me too much.</p>
                <p>Then Bill Hall, who had been the deputy chief of mission in Pakistan when I was
                    in Dacca the first time, was assigned as ambassador to Ethiopia. And he wanted
                    Chris Van Hollen as his DCM, but Chris was in Turkey, I think, and they wouldn't
                    let him go. And so he asked me if I wanted to go. And I said yes. I thought,
                    “Gee, DCM in Addis is a chance to break into Africa, you know. I think if you
                    want to get an embassy there, if you had been DCM in Addis, you might get an
                    African embassy might be possible there.” And I very much admired Bill Hall and
                    Jane, his wife, and would love to work with them.</p>
                <p>And then I suddenly got word that I had been transferred to Athens as political
                    counselor. Subsequently, Bill Hall told me he thought I preferred Athens. And I
                    said, “No, I never. If I'd had any choice, I would have jumped at Addis.”
                    Because the troubles that Mike Crosby—I don't know if you remember Mike Crosby.
                    He was serving as DCM in some African post. He had been in Greece when I had
                    earlier. He was supposed to go as political counselor to Athens, but his
                    ambassador was brought back as deputy secretary so he couldn't go. So the job
                    was open. Since I was in NEA, they threw me into the breach.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>But if I had gone to Addis, I think it would have been a completely different
                    career because one reason I went to Dacca is because I was very unhappy in
                    Athens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You really didn't want to get back into the Greek region
                        again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, I didn't. And they asked me to—well, Phil Talbot was the ambassador.
                    Phil Talbot had been assistant secretary in NEA after Rountree so I had worked
                    with him and liked him. But when I got there, I realized in terms of rank, I
                    would be about the fourth person in the embassy. I had been DCM and charg� in
                    Afghanistan for a long period of time.</p>
                <p>Also, the junta was in charge. The CIA was very supportive of the junta. CIA
                    people had very close contacts with the junta. The political section, we were
                    anti-junta.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were you anti-junta?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because of your democratic values?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: In part. I think in part because most of us in the political section had
                    served in Greece before. We had known the Greek politicians. The military would
                    serve the king. We were very fond of them. We didn't accept the argument that
                    these people were baddies. Everybody that we had known before were bitterly
                    opposed to the junta because they were political people.</p>
                <p>I've never been in a post that was so divided.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the CIA rationale for support of the
                        junta?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, a very good one really. Because the leadership of the junta had come
                    out what the Greeks call the CIA which was the Greek military intelligence. And
                    so they had been the normal working contacts of the CIA before the coup.
                    Suddenly the people that they knew, their working contacts, were now the rulers
                    of the country. So this was obviously advantageous to them, and they like them
                    and worked with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you said the embassy was quite divided?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>BLOOD: Well divided, yes. Well, primarily the military—and there were many, many
                    Greek-Americans in the CIA and among the attach�s. We had also a large MAG
                    mission. They were without exception, the Greek-Americans, 200 per cent for the
                    junta. The people who were opposed were in the political section. Bob Keeley was
                    my deputy there for a while and bitterly opposed. And the USIA, I would say most
                    of them were pretty unhappy with the junta. The economic section was sort of
                    neutral.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The DCM was McClelland?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: DCM was Ross McClelland. Phil Talbot left in January after the election
                    which brought in Mr. Nixon. And for the next year, over a year, there was no
                    ambassador. And Ross was the DCM. I mean, Ross was the charg�.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why didn't we have an ambassador appointed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, I think in part there was a feeling that you didn't want to show too
                    much enthusiasm about the junta. I mean, there were many, many Greeks opposed to
                    it. And they didn't get around to it until they appointed Henry Tasca, who
                    didn't get there until, I think, January in 1970. And so most of my period was
                    working with Ross as the DCM.</p>
                <p>And he was in the very difficult position of running a divided embassy. It was
                    really a bitterly fought struggle. The staff meetings were hostile. I've never
                    been in a place where you couldn't, you know, as American officials speak
                    frankly about the local government. But if you said anything mistaken as
                    critical about members of the junta, the CIA would explode in anger.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would they relay it to the junta members?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: I hope not. I doubt that. And then if they would, you know, started in
                    staff meetings charges about political leaders that they were no damn good or
                    can't be trusted, then I would rise to their defense. And there was much, much
                    friction. And a lot of our military there felt that this regime was very
                    popular. And our argument was “Well, if they are that popular, why don't they
                    expose themselves to an election?”</p>
                <p>“You don't need an election in a democracy, you know. They are popular. You can
                    see that just by talking to people. That is our feeling.”</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>I admit it must have been very difficult for Ross McClelland at that time.
                    Because Greece is a country in which if you have ever served there, you do get
                    emotionally involved. Most people there were emotionally involved in that
                    issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But Washington was surely aware of the problem in the
                        embassy. Did Washington not give guidance or take—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No. I think perhaps they wanted both views coming out. And then I heard
                    that Tasca was coming as ambassador. And, actually, a friend of mine in the
                    Foreign Service, Bill Crawford, who had served as Tasca's DCM in Rabat, wrote to
                    me and said that, “I know both of you. I know you and he will not get along.” He
                    didn't have a very high regard for Tasca. And I guessed that when Tasca came, he
                    would opt for a particular position in support of the junta. And I was right in
                    that.</p>
                <p>Then the issue involved primarily then was the sale of military equipment to
                    Greece: tanks, aircraft, artillery. The position that I took and the leader of
                    the political section took was that, “Okay, we didn't mind selling it to the
                    Greeks for NATO purposes but not on the justification that the rest of the CIA
                    was using that this would bring them back to democracy. These people will never
                    bring back Greece to democracy. And this is a lie. We will sell it to them only
                    for purely security purposes and tell them that, but don't operate on the
                    delusion that you are doing this as a way of encouraging democracy because that
                    is just false.” Anyhow, then when Tasca came, he did say let's give them . .
                    .</p>
                <p>So that's when they, NEA, knowing that I wanted out, said there is this opening
                    in Dacca. And they knew I had served there before. Would I be interested in
                    going?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is 19—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: '70. I guess the assignment was really firmed up at the end of—no, about
                    the end of '69, the first part of '70. I left Athens in March '70 to go to
                    Dacca. Actually, I was charg� because Ross went on home leave for a couple
                    months. When Tasca arrived, I had been charg� for a month or so. It was I who
                    greeted him when he came to Greece.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left Athens in March—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: This was direct transfer, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Direct. Did you have a feeling that the junta was there to
                        stay indefinitely?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How do you think the issue between Greek opposition to the
                        junta and its authoritarian policies were going to be resolved?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: I didn't know. I didn't foresee that the junta would make such a stupid
                    mistake over Cyprus that they would bring about their own downfall which was
                    what happened. But I just felt that it was an anomaly that the Greeks wanted a
                    democracy, that this was an abnormal situation, that sooner or later would fail.
                    That was my feeling, but I didn't know when it would take place or how it would
                    take place. I was rather pessimistic at the time seeing that they were in for a
                    long haul, and Agnew had gone over right after I left to visit them. It looked
                    like the United States was moving from a rather cool position to a warmer
                    embrace of the junta.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you think that whatever opposition there was the body
                        politic would work against us in the future?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, yes. Oh, yes, that's what we kept telling Washington that we are going
                    to pay a price for supporting a non-popular government here, that the Greeks are
                    going to remember this and hold it against us.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there was no reaction from Washington? Did you get any

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: I think they—no, no, I can't remember any. But Washington was divided too.
                    I mean, there was no, you know, great enthusiasm for the junta certainly. And as
                    I say, it took us well over a year before we moved into a warmer relationship
                    with them. And even then, I think they were still uneasy about it because the
                    rest of the NATO countries were damning them and were unhappy with them. It
                    wasn't, you know, a close embrace ever.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, my feeling is that they took sort of hands off approach; wait and
                    see what would happen. And it was actually during the Nixon Administration that
                    we moved toward a closer position.</p>

                    solidly behind us in NATO, cooperating with us militarily and every way they
                    could. Maybe, you know, why worry about it? That was the thing in the short run,
                    but we were arguing the long run that we are going to pay for this because the
                    Greek people are not happy.</p>

                <p>BLOOD: I think Ross probably felt that I was difficult at times. Of course, you
                    know, I would argue with him about—sometimes I was trying to protect Bob Keeley
                    who was much, much, much more vehement than I was in his views, but he was
                    working for me, and I was trying to protect him against, you know—Ross felt he
                    went too far in his reactions to the junta.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Of 1970.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: I went to Dacca by way of consultation in Washington. That was the first
                    time and only time I was ever sworn in. Because in those days when Bill Macomber
                    was Under Secretary for Management he had initiated a program of swearing in
                    consul generals in order to give that position more prestige and authority. So
                    there was a little ceremony which he conducted in which I took the oath of
                    office as principal officer in Dacca.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't to signify that you had more independence

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, not at all. I hope I didn't take it to mean that way.</p>
                <p>Going back to Dacca after, let's see, eight years absence was an interesting
                    experience. I knew many people there, of course. But the situation had changed
                    rather markedly. The impetus for a break away of East Pakistan from West
                    Pakistan was much stronger. President Yahya's plan to move Pakistan away from
                    martial law and back to a parliamentary democracy involving elections in both
                    wings was, of course, the major issue and the excitement of the time and made
                    for a great deal of very interesting political work.</p>
                <p>The first crisis that we confronted was the massive cyclone of November 3rd,
                    1970, which we estimated later resulted in the death of 300,000 people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to that, what would you say were the reasons
                        for this shift in Bengali attitudes against the government in West
                        Pakistan—in East Pakistan?</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In West Pakistan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: The resentments of economic discrimination had more time to simmer, more
                    time to surface. For another, the Bengalis were more politically organized. The
                    Awami League had become clearer the dominant Bengali political organization,
                    well led, very active. The 1965 war between Pakistan and India over Kashmir had
                    further divided the two wings because East Pakistan . . . The people of East
                    Pakistan weren't very appreciative of taking risk to secure gains in Kashmir.
                    And, of course, everybody knew that the country was in for political
                    transformation from military to civilian rule which made for a lot of
                    opportunities.</p>
                <p>The cyclone immediately, of course, brought many headaches to the consul general
                    and the AID mission USIA there. I had remembered earlier a much smaller cyclone
                    in 1962 where there had been some friction between the embassy and the consulate
                    general in dealing with Washington. And I was determined to avoid that friction
                    this time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of friction occurred?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, requests for aid - how would they be funneled? Who would make the
                    recommendations? And we worked out an arrangement with Ambassador Farland in
                    Islamabad that we could initiate the recommendations for aid, but they would go
                    through the embassy on the way to Washington. And Ambassador Farland sort of
                    took himself charge of this operation and worked with us, with the provincial
                    AID director in East Pakistan and with myself, very closely, more closely than
                    with the members of his own staff in the embassy. I think thereby we were able
                    to avoid some of the problems that do arise in situations like this.</p>
                <p>We initially were under very great pressure from Washington to demand relief,
                    which seems to be always the case. Then after a while, the impetus dries out and
                    then you have to fight very hard to get anything at all in the way of relief
                    supplies.</p>
                <p>For example, we were asked whether we wanted a Army field hospital to be flown
                    out. It would take many planes and much personnel. We had a doctor there, an
                    American doctor, who was on temporary duty from the Army, and he made a quick
                    helicopter survey, and we endorsed his report which was that a field hospital
                    was not necessary. I think it was the right decision. The Belgians subsequently
                    sent out a field hospital which found little cyclone-related injuries with which
                    to deal. Of course, there is always plenty of work for a hospital in treating
                    chronic dysentery and other diseases and things like that. But the cyclone
                    either drowned people or scraped up their arms, but other than that, did not
                    result in many injuries.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>It was ironic to learn that Senator Ted Kennedy was berating the State Department
                    and US Government for not doing enough to help the survivors when we were really
                    doing much more than was the government of Pakistan. And this was very obvious
                    to the Bengalis. In fact, the international response on the part of the Soviets,
                    and the British, and the Germans, and the Saudis, and the Iranians was very
                    great. The only response that was nil or minimal was the response of the
                    government of Pakistan. And we reported to Washington that the more we did, the
                    worse we made the government of Pakistan look and this would have political
                    ramifications which I think it did at the time of the elections a month
                    later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why didn't the government move more effectively? Were they
                        simply incapable of doing so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: I'm not sure. Because on the earlier occasion of 1961 - '62, the
                    government of Pakistan, particularly the Pakistani military had been very
                    effective in their relief efforts. But this time, they didn't do much. The
                    Pakistan Army cooperated with our helicopter unit we sent from Fort Bragg. The
                    Pakistan Navy sent out press release after press release we just got in the way
                    of the British Navy which was working very hard to bring relief by sea to the
                    isolated islands.</p>
                <p>It was almost as if they just didn't care. Yahya, the president, flew over East
                    Pakistan on his way back from China for about an hour while the Pope and many
                    other non-Pakistani senior officials visited East Pakistan at that time which
                    was occupying a great deal of media coverage in the world.</p>
                <p>We had the problem, of course, of handling the media. We had only a few
                    helicopters that were available and under our direction. The media naturally
                    wanted to have almost exclusive use of the helicopters. We thought some of these
                    helicopters should be engaged in dropping of relief supplies to isolated areas,
                    but we managed to work out a fairly equitable deal, arrangement, with them. We
                    knew we had to accommodate the media if we were to get continued support for
                    relief activities.</p>
                <p>Ambassador Farland came over to the east wing and was very helpful, particularly
                    in dealing with the press. He got a very bum rap at that time because one
                    American newsman—AP I believe—had reported erroneously that the helicopter in
                    which the ambassador was riding, the blades had injured a Bengali who was trying
                    to get a parcel of rice. This was not true. We found out later he based it
                    completely on hearsay and had not bothered to try to corroborate it. The
                    ambassador was very upset and went to some special lengths to try to correct
                    this erroneous report. On our part, of course, we and the embassy just
                    ostracized that reporter from then on, and he had no access to any American
                    officials.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>It was an exciting time, and I think the American role was a very helpful one in
                    that operation. The Bengalis could see—it was a very visible role because our
                    helicopters were flying in and out of the airport. So were the British and the
                    Soviet helicopters. There was much evidence of international interest and
                    concern and very little evidence of interest on the part of the government of
                    Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you said shortly thereafter elections had been
                        scheduled.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Elections had been scheduled earlier but had been postponed because—well,
                    actually elections were postponed because of some flooding earlier, and
                    elections were held in December. Many people believed that the smashing victory
                    scored by the Awami League was traceable in part to the resentment felt by
                    Bengalis over the rather diffident attitude taken by the government of Pakistan
                    for the disaster relief operations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Awami League, would you say it is something like an
                        American political party with a right, a left, a center, or factions within
                        it, or how would you describe it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: What the Awami League?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: The Awami League was the Bengali Nationalist Party that favored autonomy
                    for East Pakistan, favored better relations with India. I think in terms of the
                    left-right spectrum, I would say it was the center left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What is pretty well unified parties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: At that time, yes. It was well organized, and they ran candidates in every
                    one of the constituencies.</p>
                <p>I remember the Pakistan ambassador to the United States, Mr. Hellali, visited
                    East Pakistan after the disaster relief operation had been concluded but before
                    the elections. And I had a gathering of my principal staff members with him. He
                    asked us how we thought the election would turn out. And we said we thought the
                    Awami League would win big. He was very angry. I remember he said, “Are you a
                    Muslim?”</p>
                <p>I said, “No.”</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>And he said, “Do you know what goes in the mind of the Bengali villagers?”</p>
                <p>And I said, “No.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Well, I can tell you that they are going to vote the way the
                    mullahs tell them, and they are not going to vote for the Awami League. And you
                    are dead wrong. You have been taken in by these Bengalis.”</p>
                <p>Well, I remember also that just before the elections when I called on Sheikh
                    Mujibur Rahman, the leader of the Awami League, he told me that they would win
                    all but two of the 169 seats in the 300-man National Assembly allocated to East
                    Pakistan. I reported this to Washington, but I didn't believe it. I thought that
                    was an exaggeration. And it actually turned out to be right on the button. They
                    lost only two out of the 169 seats which gave them a majority in the National
                    Assembly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The population of East Pakistan is larger you said than of
                        West Pakistan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes. About fifty-five percent to forty-five percent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, didn't the government have any concern that that

                        government? And didn't they have any knowledge of the Awami League's
                        position?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: I think that Ambassador Hellali was typical of their views. They expected
                    that the more conservative parties like the Muslim League would do better than
                    they did and that they did not foresee that the Awami League winning such a
                    majority. Nor did they foresee Bhutto winning plurality in West Pakistan. The
                    election was very honest, but I think the results surprised them a great
                    deal.</p>

                <p>BLOOD: Yes. We all gave the Awami League a large majority, but we varied, you

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: The problem was that the program, the platform, of the Awami League were
                    the famous six points which called for such a degree of autonomy for East
                    Pakistan that it would not be—if applied, it's hard to see how you could very
                    long maintain even a fiction of a unified country. My thinking was that the
                    Awami League platform was a recipe for the dissolution of Pakistan, but it could
                    be a recipe for the peaceful dissolution of Pakistan.</p>

                    perhaps in January of 1971, a meeting in the embassy in which all the
                    constituent posts, Peshawar, Lahore, Karachi, Dacca, and the embassy, made
                    contributions, and we were wrestling with this question of suppose Pakistan does

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did this embassy debate go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, as I remember, we sort of came to a conclusion that it would be in
                    US interests preferable if Pakistan stayed together primarily for the reason
                    that if East Pakistan became independent, it would be another country very much
                    in demand and requiring economic aid. Calls on us for economic assistance would
                    be greater in the case of two Pakistans than one. But I don't recall any very
                    strong reasons other than that for—or reasons why the United States' interests
                    would be severely or even significantly damaged if the two countries should
                    split apart. Well, we were then talking in terms of a peaceful split not a—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>BLOOD: Not one brought about by war or Indian intervention.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But a weakened Pakistan would pose less of a balance to
                        India in the subcontinent. Does that bother you at all? The security
                        considerations of a split-up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, I don't think that bothered us too much because I think you could
                    also make the argument that East Pakistan was sort of a liability to West
                    Pakistan. They could never defend it against India because it is surrounded
                    virtually by India and separated by over a thousand miles. As events turned out,
                    it was almost impossible to defend against India. It had come to be something of
                    an economic drain on Pakistan. A truncated Pakistan might be, economically, more
                    viable than a united Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude towards India in this—I don't know
                        that it is probably called a crisis at this stage—but was it felt that India
                        was going to intervene in some fashion, or how were Indians' interests going
                        to be protected did you Americans think at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: I don't think we worried about that. I mean, in Pakistan we weren't
                    worrying about that too much. We thought that India would welcome and perhaps
                    try to encourage the breakup figuring that they would be on good terms with East
                    Pakistan. India and the Awami League were on very good terms.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Soviet Union and China, the great powers?
                        Did they figure into your calculations as you looked at the situation
                        developing for Pakistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, I remember the ambassador had advanced the idea, which none of us
                    believed, that China had a great interest in East Pakistan as a way of getting
                    access to the Bay of Bengal and therefore would . . . But China really was very
                    supportive of Pakistan, the government of Pakistan, and was staunchly opposed to
                    any movement toward autonomy on the part of the East Pakistanis. Soviet,
                    no—this, of course, all happened before the Indo-Soviet Peace Treaty which took
                    place in August of 1971.</p>
                <p>We were looking at it in terms of US interests, in terms of a peaceful political
                    evolution assuming that Bhutto in West Pakistan and Mujib in East Pakistan
                    wouldn't be able to work closely together in a framework of the united Pakistan,
                    and they would choose to go their separate ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So after these elections and the Awami League victory . .
                        .</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>BLOOD: Of course there were negotiations between Mujib and Bhutto and Yahya which
                    weren't getting anywhere. The National Assembly elected in December was
                    scheduled to be convened March 3rd. On March 1st, President Yahya, yielding to
                    pressure from Bhutto, announced the indefinite postponement of the convening of
                    the National Assembly. I think this was the key event that started the chain of
                    events that led to the Indo-Pak war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did Bhutto hope to achieve through that postponement?
                        What could be gained by more time? What could be accomplished in that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, I think he tried to get Mujib to back away from insistence on the
                    six points. Perhaps block Mujib from becoming the prime minister which, of
                    course, he was entitled to do because he had clear majority in the National
                    Assembly. Or just stalling for time because he knew that if the National
                    Assembly were convened, Mujib would be elected prime minister, and the most he
                    could hope for would be leader of the opposition or perhaps foreign minister in
                    a coalition government.</p>
                <p>When we heard over the radio the announcement of the postponement, we went up on
                    the roof of Adamji Court, which was the building that houses the consulate
                    general, and we could see Bengalis pouring out of office buildings all around
                    that neighborhood. Angry as hornets. They were just like a spontaneous
                    demonstration of wrath because they had believed Yahya. He would hold elections,
                    they would run the elections, and now they were being denied the fruits of
                    victory.</p>
                <p>The embassy, that same day, sent off a message to Washington with a copy to us
                    saying they thought this was a very shrewd decision on Yahya's part to defuse
                    the situation. I commented rather bluntly that we saw it completely different.
                    That just seeing this spontaneous reaction made me feel, I said that I've seen
                    the beginning of the breakup of Pakistan. I was chastised by Washington that
                    said, “Please no more hyperbole.”</p>
                <p>But it was the beginning. And the embassy being so far away from it could not
                    really, I think, accurately evaluate the anger in East Pakistan. And then that's
                    when sort of the, you might say, revolt began in which the Awami League in
                    effect took over the government of East Pakistan and began to act as if they
                    were government. The army sort of stuck to its barracks clearly building towards
                    a crisis.</p>
                <p>I had the problem then of deciding whether or not to evacuate the American
                    community because—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is March of—</hi>

                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>BLOOD: March. The crackdown was on the evening of March 25th. I still remember
                    that night vividly. We had invited some Bengalis and some members of the
                    consular corps to dinner and to see a film called “Stella Dallas”—no, “Cass
                    Kimberling” with Lana Turner and Spencer—what's his name?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Spencer Tracy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Spencer Tracy, yes. And just toward the end of the movie, I had a call
                    from my CIA colleague who had gotten down to the office. Obstructions were in
                    the road. Some Bengalis had cut down trees, and the army was beginning to move.
                    And so we—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there violence that provoked this? What provoked this
                        crackdown?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, what had happened was that Yahya, who was joined by Bhutto, came
                    over to Dacca for talks with Mujib to see if they could straighten this out. We
                    had no contact with the Pak officials at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Huh?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, most of them were—the people that we had known, the governor and the
                    general officer commanding, had been withdrawn. We found out later because they
                    had objected to the idea of a military crackdown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: And so they had been withdrawn. And, of course, the president's entourage
                    had come over. They were secluded with Bhutto and Mujib. We still had contacts
                    with the Awami League. From them, we had the impression that it was just like a
                    roller coaster. I mean, for a moment, they looked optimistic, then be
                    pessimistic, then look optimistic again. But then suddenly on the afternoon of
                    the 25th, Yahya broke off the talks, and he and Bhutto flew back to the West
                    wing. And then that night, the military moved in their brutal crackdown.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was substantial violence beforehand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, it was later claimed there had been . . . The Bengalis had torn down
                    Pakistani flags that they had seen. Some of the bazaars had refused to sell
                    supplies to the Pakistan Army. But there had been very little violence. One
                    case, an American secretary had been accosted by some Bengalis. She reported it
                    to me. I called the Awami League, and they said, “We will take care of it. You
                    will have no more problems on this score.” And we didn't. They were the de facto
                    government. So we were dealing with them in that period from about March 5 to
                    March 25; a very short period before the crackdown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, the embassy was, I assume, in touch with the
                        authorities in the West. Were they trying to persuade them in any direction
                        or the other? I mean, what was the American position on how this crisis
                        should be handled?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: I'm not aware that we had any position or were trying to exert any—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was an internal matter, and we were not—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about yourself in the East?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, I wasn't trying. I was just trying to find out what was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you talking to Mujib?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, not Mujib himself but with the people close to him. And—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: And I think it was made clear our hope was for some sort of a peaceful
                    political solution to the problem. And we were—</p>
                <p>

                <p>BLOOD: No, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was your feeling then from your conversations?
                        Did you think things were headed for—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: I didn't think the Pak military would crackdown. We were aware, of course,
                    they were reinforcing their garrisons in East Pakistan because we went to the
                    airport and we would see these PIA planes arrive full of young men in khaki
                    slacks and white shirts, all about the same age, who would be marched off the
                    plane into trucks. We knew that they were soldiers. But it just seemed to us
                    that a military crackdown would end up by precipitating the separation of the
                    wings, as it did. I mean, it was a desperate action.</p>
                <p>I think a lot of Pak military though genuinely believed they could cow the
                    Bengalis. Very many of them had a very arrogant attitude toward the Bengalis
                    whom they thought as artistic and non-martial and cowardly and people who could
                    never stand up to tough measures.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the crackdown, precisely? Barricades in the
                        streets; what else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, no, no. The crackdown was . . . They deliberately set out first to
                    destroy any Bengali units in Dacca which might have a military capability. These
                    included what was called the East Pakistan Rifles who were officered by West
                    Pakistanis but had Bengali troops. They were sort of a paramilitary organization
                    that was charged with border security and the police. And so they just attacked
                    their barracks and killed all of them that they could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say destroy, you literally mean destroy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, yes, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not order them to other units.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, no. They just tried to destroy them and kill them all they could. And
                    the police headquarters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And these were unprovoked attacks?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, yes, they were unprovoked attacks. They also attacked the university,
                    Dacca University, because the students had been active in this period, you know,
                    with demonstrations. They machine-gunned, I guess used mortars too, against the
                    dormitories and killed a large number of students. They brought up tanks before
                    the building that housed the major Awami League newspaper and blew it up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Awami League—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: They attacked the bazaars that had denied food to the troops and destroyed
                    them. They went to the university and murdered Hindu professors. One of them I
                    knew particularly was an elderly man, philosopher, who didn't have a political
                    bone in his body. I think he was killed solely because he was a Hindu.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the leadership of the Awami League?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: They were arrested, if they could find them, like Mujib. The others went
                    into hiding. A lot of them did escape.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the activities at the embassy? Were you
                        circumscribed by the military authorities? Did they tell you to stay at
                        home?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, yes. Well, there was a curfew. We were not allowed to move about for,
                    I think, about thirty-six hours. We went up on the roof, though, that night, and
                    we could watch, we could see, the battles raging. You could see the tracers and
                    hear the tanks firing, machine guns. You could see those things.</p>
                <p>Then the telephone lines were all cut. I found out later that the Pakistanis had
                    cut those to prevent communications with resistance although they blamed the
                    Awami League for cutting phone lines. We were out of telephone communications.
                    Luckily, we had radio communications with the office and with our homes.</p>
                <p>We were pretty much out of touch with our own embassy for about at least three
                    weeks. They wouldn't allow anybody from the embassy over. And see there were no
                    telephones. We had cables. That was it. And then toward the end of the three
                    weeks, they allowed me to call the ambassador on a military phone on which I
                    could speak to him. We were in cablecom communications, but they weren't allowed
                    to get over there.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>Luckily, we had the air attach� from the embassy who had been there before the
                    crackdown. I had asked for him to come over. And he was very, very helpful
                    because we were, in effect, reporting war from March 25th on, a civil war. He
                    was the only American military person there. The British also had the foresight
                    to get one of theirs over in time, too, so we could have some competent military
                    advice in reporting the struggle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he able to fly his plane around the country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, no, no. He came over on a commercial flight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Indians active at this point in helping guerrilla
                        movements?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, no. I don't think they had been active before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now how did the embassy react? I assume you reported all
                        this pretty much as you described it here. But how did the embassy react to
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: With disbelief. They, of course, were being told by the government of
                    Pakistan that nothing much had happened. And this attitude of disbelief began to
                    show up in their comments and their messages which was very depressing. I mean,
                    people like the DCM, Sid Sober, who had entered the Service with me were close
                    friends and still are. I remember when he came over. I guess he was the first
                    one over before the ambassador in late April when the government of Pakistan
                    lifted the ban and after we had—I'll get to the evacuation in a minute—evacuated
                    women, children, and nonessential dependents. And you could see that he just
                    didn't believe it because a couple of Bengalis told him really nothing had
                    happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The big crisis was over. I mean—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes. The initial fighting . . . It took about two weeks before the Pak
                    Army managed to defeat and drive out—at least across the border into India—most
                    of the organized resistance to them. But what had happened then was, of course,
                    a guerrilla type resistance grew up and spread.</p>
                <p>Of course, now came the question of the evacuation. Even before the March 25th
                    crackdown, a number of the foreign communities had been evacuated. The U.N.,
                    French, Germans, Japanese evacuated their communities.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had there been some attacks on foreigners?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, there had been no attacks, but there was anticipation that we were
                    headed toward a civil war. I had decided against evacuation for two reasons
                    primarily. One was I knew with the Awami League in control that Americans were
                    not in danger. Americans were very highly thought of. Nobody felt any sense of
                    personal danger. Also, I felt that if we pull out, it would signal we sort of
                    accepted the inevitability of a civil war and a conflict. If we stayed, then it
                    was sort of evidence that we thought there was still some chance for a
                    settlement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that make you nervous about putting your fellow
                        Americans at risk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes, oh, yes. It's a very awesome responsibility because you have to make
                    judgments—I was under no pressure from the American community to pull out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Washington? Did they want you to do one thing
                        or the other?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No. Well, the ambassador, who was undergoing some medical treatment in
                    Thailand, sent me a message saying, “My only advice to you is err on the side of
                    caution.” I wasn't quite sure what that meant.</p>
                <p>But then after the military crackdown, the situation changed drastically. Now
                    Washington found it hard to believe that Americans could be in danger once the
                    Pak military was in control. But we were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In danger from what? From whom?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: From the Pak military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: There were several instances of Americans being . . . Well, I should
                    explain first that among the troops sent to East Pakistan, there were troops
                    that were not regular army. There were frontier levies from the northwest
                    frontier province who were not front line troops. There were several instances
                    where Americans had been threatened at gunpoint by soldiers and told that they
                    were going to be killed immediately. There were other instances where soldiers
                    would leave their—</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We were discussing the evacuation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes. I mentioned that our people were in danger from these
                    semi-disciplined Pakistani troops. On several occasions, the Pakistani soldiers
                    would leave the barracks in the evening and rob American houses. In one case,
                    they took the watch off an American wife at gunpoint. In another case, an
                    American confessed to me that he had actually killed a Pakistani soldier who had
                    tried to kill him and had buried the body. It was beginning . . .</p>
                <p>We were also harboring, all of us were harboring, Bengalis, mostly Hindu
                    Bengalis, who were trying to flee mostly by taking refuge with our own servants.
                    Our servants would give them refuge. All of us were doing this. I had a message
                    from Washington saying that they had heard we were doing this and to knock it
                    off. I told them we were doing it and would continue to do it. We could not turn
                    these people away. They were not political refugees. They were just poor, very
                    low-class people, mostly Hindus, who were very much afraid that they would be
                    killed solely because they were Hindu.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have Hindu servants?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: We had some. We all had a mixture of Muslim and Hindu servants. They
                    worked very closely together, well together. So this was another danger. I don't
                    think if I had ordered the community to stop that they would have stopped. It
                    was just a humanitarian gesture that really was essential. It was really a
                    humanitarian gesture that was being undertaken by our own servants out of
                    humanity to fellow Bengalis.</p>
                <p>I had had a squad of Bengali police who had been camped in a tent on my front
                    yard because earlier there had been some left-wing death threats against me. The
                    East Pakistan police had sent this unit to guard my residence. When the fighting
                    began, of course, they were fearful of their lives so they took off their
                    uniforms and buried their rifles in my back yard. Then later, the NCO in charge
                    approached me and said that he had done nothing during the fighting. He wanted
                    to return the rifles to the Pak Army, but would I go and vouch for him.</p>
                <p>So I took him and the rifles to the nearest Pak military quarters and swore that
                    what this gentleman had been doing and why he had the rifles in my yard and what
                    he had done with them and that I could see him not taken apart. I hope he
                    escaped safely.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, so I decided to recommend to Washington that we evacuate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was—</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>BLOOD: This would have been about mid-April. Washington's tone, which heretofore
                    had been, “Anything you say, just give the word,” suddenly changed. “Now wait a
                    minute. Let's think this out. Are you sure you want to do this?”</p>
                <p>I had, of course, pointed out that we knew full well that an evacuation by us now
                    would be taken amiss by the government of Pakistan because they were claiming
                    that everything was peaceful. So if the Americans evacuate, obviously we didn't
                    think they were peaceful. But I said I think that the safety of the American
                    community overrides that consideration.</p>
                <p>They finally agreed to the evacuation, but the government of Pakistan insisted
                    that we fly from Dacca to Karachi and use PIA planes. The same planes that were
                    bringing over military reinforcements then could be used to evacuate our people
                    on the round trip. This was upsetting because the evacuation plan, which had
                    been worked out before, was for US Air Force planes from Thailand to take us to
                    Bangkok which is only two hours away and a similar climate and a place to which
                    we could get to visit our families more readily.</p>
                <p>Washington agreed to the Pakistan demand. So our wives, children, and
                    nonessential employees had to fly from Dacca to Sri Lanka to Karachi, which is
                    the same length of time as going from New York to London. They were being flown
                    by crews which were absolutely exhausted because they were ferrying troops back
                    and forth. The government of Pakistan was, I guess, apprehensive that some of
                    our people would leave the plane in Sri Lanka so they insisted on picking up
                    their passports from them as they boarded the plane to be returned only in
                    Karachi.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were they so desirous of having your people arrive in
                        West Pakistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, they were going from there to Tehran.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did they care whether they went—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, first of all, Washington agreed to say we should describe it as a
                    thinning out, not as an evacuation. Of course, it was an evacuation. And if they
                    went out in so-called commercial PIA flights, it wouldn't look as strong an
                    action as if the US Air Force came and picked them up and took them out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>BLOOD: I'm not sure why they wanted . . . And, of course, PIA was going back to
                    Karachi anyhow. So they spent a night in Karachi and then flew on to Tehran. But
                    this disgruntled a large number of the American community there. Many of
                    them—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were all dependents plus all private Americans, or
                        who was being evacuated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Dependents, nonessential employees, private Americans. We also smuggled
                    out several Bengali spouses of American citizens.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That may have been one of the reasons Pakistanis wanted
                        control of the exit. They didn't want people to leave who they—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: But they didn't block them anyhow. You could just walk through with your
                    spouse with your passport and get out.</p>
                <p>But I could sense, you know, from Washington's reaction that they weren't too
                    happy with this decision to evacuate. I also knew—as the person on the spot who
                    says evacuate, and if they overrule me and something should ever happen, they
                    [would blame me]. I really thought it was.</p>
                <p>Our people wanted to go. They were desperate to go mostly because they were very
                    angry. They were angry against our government for having . . . See, the
                    Washington attitude had been there was nothing going on there. These people had
                    seen all this happening. They were angry at the US government's failure to
                    denounce the atrocities. I mention that too frankly. I know that some of these
                    people when they get back, they are going to go to congressmen and the press,
                    and they are going to complain. But you can't muzzle that. You can't keep them
                    here. I mean, they can go out commercially if they want to. And it's bound to
                    come out sooner or later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the American press? Weren't they covering the

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, the American press had been all—on the day after the evacuation, all
                    the foreign press had been trundled up and expelled.</p>

                </p>

                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>BLOOD: I think the 26th of March.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I see. There were no American press.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, there were a couple, one of whom came in surreptitiously over the
                    border, one who escaped hiding. We hid him. We hid him in our house so they
                    could keep reporting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could they get their reports out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you send their reports out, too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes. Also, we were—in fact, I never read so many other people's mail as at
                    that time because in this period of evacuation, the commercial wireless was also
                    cut. So we had our own communications, of course, the consul general. We weren't
                    relying on Pakistan facilities.</p>
                <p>But other smaller officers didn't. So the Japanese and Nepalese and others, when
                    they organized their own evacuation, they did it through us. We would send, say,
                    a message to Kathmandu at our embassy which then relayed it to the Nepalese
                    government who would then come back through us. I would give the message to the
                    Nepalese consul general. Same with the Japanese. Later on when the Canadian high
                    commissioner came over, of course they had no facilities, so we transmitted

                        seriously at odds with people in Washington. What would you say marked the

                        to—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, you have to remember that it was really Nixon and Kissinger and
                    their people against the bureaucracy, as we found out later. I was a real part
                    of the bureaucracy. We discovered when we went back to Washington virtually
                    everybody in the State Department felt the same way we did.</p>

                <p>BLOOD: We didn't know that in the field. You know, you know how instructions come
                    out of the Department, you don't know usually who is writing them. I really was
                    not aware until I came back that our position had had such strong support at
                    least among the working levels in NEA and elsewhere in the government.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or the perception of the way things were developing. What
                        I was getting at was is there a particular point, was it the evacuation, was
                        it earlier reports, where is it that you think you took a step down or up,
                        as you prefer to call it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: A little hard to pinpoint, but it would be right after March 25th when we
                    began to report the crackdown. I will admit we did it very bluntly. We didn't
                    disguise it in diplomatic niceties. We talked about, you know, 5,000 people
                    probably being slaughtered that night. Things like that. We also had evidence.
                    Of course, I mean, I never saw anybody murdered myself, but we had Catholic
                    priests out in the countryside who . . . When Hindu villages were machine-gunned
                    by the Pakistan Army, these people would flee to the Catholic mission for
                    sanctuary. We sent American doctors up there to treat their wounds. Actually, we
                    didn't send them; they went up there on their own. So these were American
                    eyewitness reports of atrocities which we were reporting.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we get to that, the embassy's view. How did they
                        mesh with you all? Were they supportive, critical, were they just hands off?
                        How did they handle your reporting? They must have had some idea.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes. As I recall it, they sort of disbelieved that we were reporting
                    accurately.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After the evacuation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, before the evacuation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In April.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Before the evacuation. Early to mid-April. Actually, the dissent message
                    was drafted by twelve or thirteen people on my staff. I did not draft it. They
                    came to me and said we want to send this statement, we are so upset with the US
                    failure to denounce the atrocities. They were all key people in AID, USIA. My
                    own deputy didn't, but he was a weak officer. I think he decided he was too
                    scared or something. But everybody whose opinion I respected had
                    participated.</p>
                <p>So I decided to send it, and I transmitted it. But I transmitted it along with a
                    strong supportive statement. I said, “I had not personally drafted this. It was
                    presented to me. But these are my best officers. I believe in what they are
                    saying. I accord with their sentiments completely,” and sent it off.</p>
                <p>Now, I think we sent it secret [limited distribution].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Henry Kissinger said you sent it at such a low
                        classification, it was sure to leak.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes, that's not true. I should have sent it up. Secret [limited
                    distribution] was the highest thing we were used to using. Now there is EXDIS
                    that at the time was higher. EXDIS, eyes only, I should have done that. Now I
                    recognize that. But at the time, I used the highest classification that we were
                    accustomed to using. There certainly was no intention, that's not true. That's
                    just his supposition, but I can assure you that's not true. Any of it.</p>
                <p>We sent it to the embassy and to Washington and the other posts in Pakistan. Of
                    course, the embassy immediately grabbed it away from the other posts.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the embassy's reaction? Did it comment on the
                        message?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, their action, of course, was to take it away from the other posts. I
                    don't recall. The ambassador and I never had any harsh words during this time,
                    ever.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the ambassador was not someone to have harsh words.

                <p>BLOOD: Yes, but Sid and I, of course, were friends of long standing, close
                    friends.</p>
                <p>No, I mean, I knew when we sent it, they wouldn't like it. I mean, we are not
                    that dumb.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After all, you wouldn't have sent a dissent message if you

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No. Remember, this is just about the time that the idea of dissent
                    messages was being heard about.</p>

                <p>BLOOD: We had been reading about the possibility of dissent messages.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you got no particular reaction to you from the embassy.
                        What about from Washington? Did someone reply and say you are right or you
                        are wrong? Did you get any indication that it had been read back there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, we began to get newspaper, but when—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It leaked.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: When it leaked. Then we knew it had leaked. And then I—I don't know, maybe
                    about a couple weeks later—I'm trying to think how I got the word I ought to ask
                    for a transfer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who did you get that word from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: I'm trying to think. It may have been Sid. That didn't bother me after
                    then so understand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you didn't ask for a transfer, did you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, then I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, you did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, they said to do it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They said, “Ask for a transfer.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes. And I was due for home leave. I had gone on a direct transfer from
                    Athens. I hadn't had home leave for a long time. So I asked for home leave and
                    transfer and then the word came back to the apartment. Things were sort of
                    interesting there. I wasn't in any hurry to leave so I stayed until about mid
                    June. I did get one, I guess, indication from Sid who said, “When are you
                    leaving?” Oh, politely done. But they were obviously hoping I would get out of
                    there. But I wasn't in any great hurry to go. I mean, I knew I had to go, but I
                    was sort of enjoying . . .</p>
                <p>The situation was so interesting. We were down to about thirteen officers. The
                    other countries' offices were also down to a few staff. Incidentally, the
                    British deputy high commissioner left the same day I did for the same reason.
                    And the Iranian was stopped by the Paks because he had visited the Indian deputy
                    high commissioner who was under house arrest there. The Paks didn't like that.
                    They brought the attention of the Shah's government, and they pulled him
                    out.</p>
                <p>I visited the Indian deputy high commissioner twice but on instructions. The
                    Pakistani deputy high commissioner in Calcutta had been put under similar house
                    arrest in Calcutta. Our consul general there or somebody in his staff had
                    visited him and taken something to drink or reading materials and kept up
                    contact and sent messages on his behalf back to New Delhi. This was quid pro
                    quo. So on two occasions, I called on the Indian, who was a good friend, and I
                    was allowed to by the Pak Army. They had him under house arrest. And I visited
                    with him. But this was done with Pak knowledge and only because in Calcutta, we
                    were performing similar service for Pakistani officials in the same
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the leak of your dissent message affect your
                        ability to do business in Dacca? Could you talk to Bengali political
                        intellectuals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, they were either dead or in hiding. Of course, the Pak military
                    officials were very anxious to talk to us because there was evidence that we
                    accepted them.</p>
                <p>General Kikakan, who is now, I think, governor of Punjab, was sent over as
                    governor. He is a lieutenant general in the army and had a reputation of being a
                    very tough guy in Baluchistan earlier. When he was sworn in—this was right after
                    the crackdown—I declined to go. I sent a junior officer instead. And I knew he
                    wanted me to call on him. I stalled. One afternoon as I was leaving work, a Pak
                    Army captain with a revolver in a jeep came by and said, “The governor has
                    instructed me to escort you to his office.” So I went out there. We had a
                    pleasant chat. Then the next day in the paper, “American Consul General Calls on
                    the Governor.” But I did it at gunpoint. [Laughter]</p>

                <p>BLOOD: I left in June, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In June. And when you came back to Washington, what kind
                        of reception did you find?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Sisco was unhappy. He blamed me for leaking the message or at least giving
                    it too low a classification. Nick Veliotes arranged for me to see Irwin, who was
                    then deputy secretary. He was much friendlier. He wanted to know what I thought
                    about the prospects of Indian intervention and asked my views. He was very nice.
                    I think he genuinely—I think Nick had put him up to it. Nick said, “You ought to
                    talk to this guy.” Those were the two major impressions.</p>
                <p>Then I went on leave to Colorado. I joined my wife. And then I guess Howie
                    Schaffer called me up to tell me that I had won the Herter award and please come
                    back to Washington to receive it. I guess it was only then that I really feel,
                    you know, that my peers at least applauded the action.</p>
                <p>Later on, I talked to Chris Van Hollen. Chris was very helpful because by then I
                    got a copy of my efficiency report which Sid Sober had written in which he had
                    said a couple things which I took strong issue with it. One was that I had in
                    fact encouraged the American community to be critical of the US government's
                    handling of the situation. Of course, that is not true. I said that it was a
                    genuine feeling that everybody felt, and I didn't have to encourage it. I didn't
                    do anything to encourage it. I shared it, but I didn't encourage it. And a
                    couple other things like that. Chris—Joe Sisco refused to make a comment, but
                    Chris, I think, put his neck on the limb, and he wrote a supplementary review
                    statement. And then also that I hadn't behaved properly in Washington. And I
                    objected to that, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: I was called up to testify before the Senate judicial subcommittee which
                    also handled refugees. Ted Kennedy's subcommittee. When they started asking
                    sensitive questions, I said we would have to go to an executive session, they
                    stopped it then. There wasn't anything the Department could have objected to at
                    all in that testimony. Chris said, you know, we have cooperated completely with
                    the Department, and we have no objection to anything that he has done. Of
                    course, Sid wasn't even in Washington then. He was home in Islamabad. I was
                    still a loyal Foreign Service officer.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you didn't see Kissinger, I'm sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: What?</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't see Kissinger at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, no. He was, of course, over—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the White House.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Sisco . . . Rogers, of course, he had to give me the award at the meeting.
                    I think he was a little embarrassed about that. I think this whole thing put him
                    in—I'm sure Kissinger probably said, “Look at your State Department people. They
                    can't even follow instructions.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now who took your place in Dacca at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, my deputy was Bob Carle. He acted briefly and then—oh, gee, who is
                    the guy who took my place?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was George Griffin there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: George never served in Dacca. He served in Calcutta, he served in New
                    Delhi, served in Kos.</p>
                <p>The person who took my place got into the same trouble I did. He went out there,
                    and he was there after the war when Mujib returned in triumph to Dacca. He was
                    instructed not to go to the airport to meet him, and he did. He was bounced
                    out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did you continue to follow in that—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, yes, pretty close.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Department ever ask your advice or call you for
                        consultation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>BLOOD: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your next assignment then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Personnel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, you went back to Personnel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it all inevitable, in your opinion?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: I think the breakup of Pakistan was inevitable from the beginning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Kissinger says he felt that was the case himself. Did you
                        get a sense that Washington thought Pakistan was going to split
                        asunder?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, I don't think that was Washington's viewpoint. I think that the hope
                    had been all along that this country would stay together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But Kissinger said that he felt that it was indeed going
                        to happen. What could we have done to make it easier? I mean, what could
                        have been done at what stage to make that division less violent, less
                        traumatic, for the region? Or could it have been avoided? Could there have
                        been a peaceful splitting of the two Pakistans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: I don't see how we could have intervened effectively in the negotiations
                    beforehand. I mean, there is an election. People are trying to decide how to
                    handle the results of an election.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We couldn't have given the Pakistanis some advice on this
                        that they might have taken? Was it just simply too close to the core of
                        Pakistan's being for us—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: I think so, I think so. What we could have done is, I think, we could have
                    cracked down. I mean, we could have expressed our unhappiness and dismay with
                    the Pakistani military crackdown on March 25th and told them in no uncertain
                    terms that this is a sure way of spelling the death of a united Pakistan.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But what would that have done for us? If we had come down
                        hard against the Pak government for their handling of that crackdown, what
                        consequences might have flowed from that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: It might not have dissuaded the Paks from continuing, but it would have
                    positioned ourselves on the side of right and justice, and we would have been
                    doing the—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: More self-respect.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes, yes. And sometimes that's the best thing to do. I mean, more often
                    than not, it's the best thing to do because you do pay a penalty for it. We paid
                    a penalty for it certainly in our relations with India. I mean, we got more and
                    more involved on the losing side of a conflict. The only valid reason is to
                    protect the opening to China. And, of course, none of us knew anything about
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was no indication of that whatsoever, is that
                        right?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, no, not at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, so then you went back to Personnel, unless you have
                        further reflections.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, I went back to Personnel. I was fairly lucky largely in working for
                    Cleo because we decided to reorganize the assignment section. In fact, we turned
                    the clock back to the way it was before. In the interval, they had made a class
                    system, you know, instead of by bureaus, which we thought was absurd. So we did.
                    We rebuilt it the way it was.</p>
                <p>Then when Cleo was charged with the Foreign Service assignments division, I was
                    his deputy. Then he moved up to the assistant director for assignments, and I
                    took over. Then when he went to Sudan, I moved over to his position.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>Then through a series of sort of unexpected developments, I found myself just as
                    Kissinger was coming back to the State Department as acting director general of
                    the Foreign Service. Because Bob Brewster was director of personnel, and then he
                    got an embassy, Ecuador. So they needed somebody to be acting director of
                    Personnel. So I was—Bill Hall who was the director general picked me. So I
                    became acting director of Personnel. Then Bill Hall went to—no, he had been
                    ambassador to Ethiopia, and he was told he wasn't going to get another
                    ambassadorial assignment so he resigned. Quickly. Just like that. And so I
                    became acting director general and had that job for several months. Then
                    Kissinger came in, and he picked Nat Davis to be DG.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He didn't call you in and say—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, no, I never even saw him. I did see him once. When I was acting
                    director general, he was invited to the book fair and inspect that. So I went up
                    with a couple of the ladies to escort him down. I gave him my name, but he—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't react?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Didn't react. But then Nat asked me, “Well, you know, what would you like
                    to do?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, of course, you know, like everybody else, I would like to get an
                    embassy.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “Well, I'll—”</p>
                <p>But I said, “I've always felt that since, you know, Dacca and particularly Mr.
                    Kissinger as Secretary, my chances were nil.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Okay, we will give it a try.” And my name went up for, I think, upper
                    Malta.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, then Nat had asked me to go out to represent him in India at a
                    conference. I had just come back from that, and he called me at home. He said,
                    “When the Secretary recognized who that was, he hit the roof, and he said, 'Get
                    that guy out of Washington.' So you have got to get out of Washington. Where do
                    you want to go? I mean, fast.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, I know that Herman Halsis is going home, leaving the Army War
                    College. I've been there as a student and liked it, what about that?”</p>
                <p>And Nat said, “Okay, we'll work that out.”</p>
                <p>And so I suddenly went up to Carlisle.</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you stayed there . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: I stayed there until the Carter Administration came in. And then my
                    name—earlier I had tried through Personnel and found out that—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still no—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Still no chance, just forget it putting my name up for anything halfway
                    decent. We were enjoying it in Carlisle even though from a career point of view,
                    it wasn't a helpful assignment. The State Department didn't know what I was
                    doing there and couldn't care less.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: But the Army were very, very courteous. Then there came, you know, putting
                    my name up for a number of possibilities. When the—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: New Delhi.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: New Delhi one came through, and I went down and met with Ambassador Goheen
                    and hit it off and got a job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And now you went out to New Delhi in—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: October 1, 1977. I left October 1, 1981. Four years to the day, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So all right. This is your first assignment to India. You
                        had been on the other side of the line.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Right. I had been on the other side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What's your sense of dealing with the Indians as opposed
                        to dealing with Pakistanis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: New Delhi is the capital of South Asia. It's the big city. People are much
                    more, I would say, accessible and open and frank and argumentative than in the
                    other countries so I enjoyed that. It was like the big leagues.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that there was this bias or tilt towards
                        India in the Department that Kissinger describes in his books? That is, the
                        Department felt that India being the largest, most powerful country in the
                        subcontinent, it's the one we ought to pay more attention to instead of
                        Pakistan which he and Nixon sort of favored. Was there that disposition to
                        give—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: I think so. I think that many of us who served in Pakistan also like the
                    Paks, fond of Pakistan, but have always been sort of suspicious of this idea
                    that Pakistan is an ally of the United States. They are really not. I mean, our
                    interests aren't that close. They can be cooperative at times, but they are not
                    an ally in the sense, you know, of Britain or Germany or France even. They are
                    in it for their own purposes, mostly to build up strength against India.</p>
                <p>No, I think most of us who served in that area recognized that India is the
                    dominant power and will become even more so over time.</p>
                <p>I liked working with the Indians, probably more than with Pakistanis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived in India and set yourself up as DCM, they
                        obviously knew that you had been the dissenting consul general in
                        Dacca.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: With the Indians, of course, that was very much of a plus.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. Did that help you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes, it did. Oh, publicly nothing was ever said about it, but the newsmen
                    were aware of it, and the Indian foreign office people were aware of it. I think
                    I was looked upon as somebody who was not hostile to India.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we generally off to a good start with India in the
                        Carter Administration and Ambassador—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was he a popular figure there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes, we were off to a good start because his arrival coincided almost
                    exactly with the end of the emergency in the election of the Desai government
                    and Mrs. Gandhi's departure and the restoration of human rights and democracy in
                    India. So that was very much a plus. Then Desai and Jimmy Carter had a rather
                    interesting relationship through letter writing that went a little further than
                    most of the letters written from head of state to head of state.</p>
                <p>So it was a good time to arrive there. But then, of course, things began to
                    disintegrate to some extent because of the nuclear issue, for one, and then
                    because of the dissolution of the Janata government fell apart or were voted
                    out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talk about the nuclear issue a little bit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: That was the major issue that we as the embassy had with India during the
                    time that I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What prompted the Indians to go nuclear? Was it their
                        experience with East Pakistan and the United States at that time? Our
                        tilting policy towards Pakistan government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, I think there are a couple reasons. One was the Chinese went nuclear
                    in 1964. And India now thinks of themselves in the same league with China rather
                    than in the league with Pakistan. There is often speculation that when we sent
                    the Enterprise task force into the Bay of Bengal in 1971, that the Indians
                    thought that if perhaps they had nuclear weapons, maybe we would have hesitated
                    to make any such show of force. I think it's primarily because the Chinese did
                    it. Also, I think it was a matter of prestige.</p>
                <p>Remember, the Indians exploded a nuclear device, but they haven't gone that extra
                    step of making nuclear weapons. They could, but they haven't.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, yes. They have shown they can do it, but they have stopped short so
                    they can get the best of both worlds. They have proven that they are technically
                    capable, and they can still inveigh against nuclear weapons.</p>

                <p>BLOOD: I don't think so. I think we have been following that as closely as we

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They had already done the explosion.</hi>
                </p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So what was the issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: The issue was not that. The nuclear issue was Congress had passed the
                    Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978 which said that after a eighteen-month
                    grace period, the United States would be obliged to stop shipments of nuclear
                    material to any country which did not have all of its nuclear facilities under
                    IAEA safeguards or which did not—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Permit its—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Join the Nonproliferation Treaty which would amount to the same thing. The
                    Nuclear Nonproliferation Act of 1978 obliged the United States to, after
                    eighteen-months grace period, to suspend shipments of nuclear material to any
                    country that didn't put all its nuclear facilities under IAEA safeguards or
                    adhere to the Nonproliferation Treaty which is the same thing because
                    signatories of the Nonproliferation Treaty have to put all their facilities
                    under safeguards.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>We had an agreement with India whereby we would provide slightly enriched uranium
                    to be used as fuel in two nuclear power reactors near Bombay, a place called
                    Tarapur. These facilities were under IAEA safeguards. And the Indians had agreed
                    not to reprocess into plutonium any of the fuel or to look elsewhere for a
                    supplier. The problem was that India had other nuclear facilities which were not
                    under safeguard. Facilities which they developed on their own without foreign
                    help. They refused to put these under safeguard.</p>
                <p>So under the terms of the Act, when the Indians applied for new shipments of
                    enriched uranium, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission voted against the shipment.
                    Under the law, the president could decide in the national interest to go ahead
                    with the shipment anyhow, but the Congress could veto the president's action by
                    a vote of both houses of Congress.</p>
                <p>President Carter authorized the shipment. The House voted against the shipment,
                    and the Senate by a very close vote, two votes I think, sustained the president.
                    So that shipment went forward, but it was very clear to everybody as a result of
                    these events that that would be the last shipment. And it was.</p>
                <p>Then we went into a sort of never-never land with the Indians in which time the
                    Soviets offered to supply them. But the end result which took place well after I
                    left India was that the Indians agreed to get their enriched uranium from
                    France. The facilities are still under safeguard, but the other Indian
                    facilities are not under safeguard so we have ceased to be a supplier to India
                    in the nuclear field and without any influence in the nuclear field any
                    more.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Should we have conducted ourselves differently on that
                        issue? Should we have—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, I think the . . . There was never any disagreement in the embassy and
                    in the State Department that we should keep trying to negotiate with the
                    Indians. The trouble was that this legislation had this guillotine effect, you
                    know. If by a certain time the Indians don't do something, boom, you've got to
                    cut it off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could we have prevailed if we hadn't had that humiliating
                        deadline for the Indians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Perhaps, perhaps. But the Indians feel very strongly about this. They feel
                    the Nonproliferation Treaty is discriminatory because it distinguishes the
                    nuclear haves from the have-nots. And also the US action went further than the
                    actions of any other nuclear supplier like the Soviets or the French or the
                    Germans or the British by insisting that all facilities be under safeguard. I
                    think it was a poorly conceived bit of legislation. It has caused the same
                    problem in a number of other countries like Argentina and Brazil where we have
                    cut off assistance, and those countries have merely just gone to another country
                    for assistance.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, no. We would much prefer the French to the Soviets as a supplier.</p>

                <p>BLOOD: I don't know whether we encouraged it, but we certainly welcomed it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Really?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes. Oh, no, the idea was not to cut them off from the supplier. The idea,
                    of course, was to use that as leverage, that was the Congressional intent. It
                    was never the embassy viewpoint, the embassy just had to live with the law. It
                    really exacerbated our US-Indian relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the law—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: And see the Indians could claim it was ex post facto. Here we were with an
                    agreement that was supposed to last until 1993, and we were changing the
                    conditions upon which we provided the shipment. When we initially made this
                    agreement, we weren't that stringent. We suddenly decided to apply very, very
                    stringent conditions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the law designed, written, with India in mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, not particularly. I think it was in part because the Indian explosion
                    in 1974 had triggered a lot of concern that countries could use their peaceful
                    nuclear power system to get the material for nuclear weapons. India was the
                    first country that did that. That was the concern - that other countries would
                    follow suit.</p>

                    terms but in official terms, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there other issues with the Indians where we had
                        harmonious and productive relationships? I mean, how would you characterize
                        it after that happy beginning?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Happy beginning. Well, it turned sour not only because of the nuclear
                    issue but also because of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan which suddenly made
                    Pakistan very important in our eyes because that was the only way you could get
                    aid to the Afghan resistance was through Pakistan. When I went out to India, it
                    was sort of a nice situation in that our relations with India were much better
                    than our relations with Pakistan at the time.</p>

                <p>BLOOD: And human rights, and the fact that they didn't have a functioning
                    democracy there. So that was sort of the interesting—I had never been in that
                    situation before.</p>
                <p>But with the Soviet invasion, suddenly Pakistan became very important to us, and
                    India became relatively unimportant. And the Indians sensed that and didn't like
                    and were pretty unhappy about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Indians, of course, didn't react nearly the way we did

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, thought it was exaggerated. They thought by helping the resistance
                    against the Soviets, we were just prolonging the Soviet occupation of
                    Afghanistan and that we should cease. If we wanted the Soviets out, we shouldn't
                    help the resistance.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: They argued that they would just leave. When the resistance petered out,
                    they would just leave the communist government in place and pull out.</p>

                <p>BLOOD: Well, remember, Afghanistan traditionally had bad relations with Pakistan.
                    So I think India would like to see a government there that is not on friendly
                    terms with Pakistan which is unlikely to happen. The earlier governments had not

                        eyes of the Indians, no? I mean, the Indians preferred the Soviets because
                        of their aid program much as the Afghans had in your earlier stay in that
                        country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, in India there is sort of a dual track operating. Indians appreciate
                    Soviet military sales and aid and consistent diplomatic support that the Soviet
                    Union has given to India. At the same time, they really prefer Westerners to
                    Soviets. They are democrats themselves. They like our ways of life, our
                    institutions much more than the Soviets. The aim of most Indians is to visit the
                    United States or live in the United States, many of them. They are quite capable
                    of making the distinction on sort of the geopolitical level and on the personal
                    level.</p>

                <p>BLOOD: No, no more than the usual you would have in most posts where you bumped
                    into them very occasionally. They were represented there by Yuli Vorontsov, who
                    had been in Washington, who was the first deputy Soviet foreign minister and is
                    now concurrently serving as Soviet ambassador to Afghanistan. Very able

                        think our embassy understood the Indian scene? Was it a country where you
                        could get behind what's in the press and really get an appreciation for the
                        dynamics of politics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: I think we could pretty well. I think generally we tended to underestimate
                    the extent of the swings in the pendulum. For instance, to underestimate the
                    Janata victory in '77 and Mrs. Gandhi's return victory in the end of 1979. We
                    could call it right as to the winner, but we tended to be more—</p>

                <p>BLOOD: Visitors, yes, like congressmen, Jeane Kirkpatrick, somebody like that. I
                    don't think Washington ever asked me to seek an appointment with her on my own,
                    so I didn't. I wasn't rebuffed by her, but it just was not requested.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Remarkable woman. I mean, she—a woman of moods. I think the moods though
                    could be politically guided. I've seen her very charming when say somebody like
                    Chuck Percy, Senator from Illinois, came. Very friendly, chatting family and all
                    that. Very warm in her own home. I've seen her when she received Jeane
                    Kirkpatrick, and Jeane Kirkpatrick was doing her best to be nice and gracious,
                    and Mrs. Gandhi was cold as an iceberg from the very beginning. I mean, she just
                    decided she didn't want to have anything to do with Jeane Kirkpatrick and made
                    it probably cruelly obviously apparent.</p>

                    mean, if she thought we were doing the wrong thing, the wrong idea, she would
                    waste no time in telling that.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you came later? You didn't go immediately?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No. Bruce Amstutz was the DCM to Spike, and he became charg� after Spike's
                    murder. But by October—in the meantime—yes, by October he wanted a break. He
                    wanted to join his wife in Europe and have a little respite from Afghanistan.
                    Washington asked me to go up from New Delhi and take over the embassy for, as it
                    turned out, about six weeks. And so I did.</p>
                <p>Under supplementary instruction there we didn't maintain embassy, but we dealt
                    with consular administrative matters not political. The foreign minister then,
                    Shah Mohammed Dose, I had known when he was a junior political officer when I
                    was there the first time so I did call on him and did find out a couple things
                    about . . . For instance, there was a fellow that had been director general of
                    their ministry of foreign affairs, Raul Rolanfahadi. It was rumored that he had
                    been killed in Afghanistan, and Dose could tell me in all honesty that he was
                    not dead. I was happy to report that. Subsequently, he did escape from
                    Afghanistan and got back to France.</p>
                <p>Then Washington asked me to seek an appointment with Hafizullah Amin who was the
                    president and the leader. He was also head of the party. And I did. I think I
                    was the last Westerner to see Amin alive because he was killed by the Soviets
                    when they invaded Christmas of '79.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did Washington want to tell him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, about the only thing they wanted to tell him was that he couldn't
                    expect any resumption of aid until he could satisfy us about their role in
                    Spike's death.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Uh huh.</hi>

                <p>BLOOD: Because, you know, remember the circumstances were—</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Were such that it was just an equivocal role that the Afghans and the
                    Soviets played, too, in that. Then to just sort of listen to him. And I did make
                    that point. We had really terminated our AID mission. There were just a couple
                    residual people left over there. Of course, it was impossible. You couldn't have
                    conducted an AID effort anyhow because there was a civil war going on, and you
                    couldn't—I mean, it was an academic issue really. But at least we could make
                    that point - that we weren't satisfied with their attitude.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have anything that you observed in your six weeks
                        in Afghanistan that gave you the feeling the Soviets might be contemplating
                        a move into the country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Not really. The Soviets were moving in incrementally all that time. In
                    fact, we were having sort of a running discussion with Washington about how many
                    were in the country. We were trying to keep track. We could see convoys with
                    Soviet equipment and Soviet troops coming down, and we tried to keep tabs on as
                    much as we can. As I recall, we were debating whether there were 8,000 or 12,000
                    in the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they engaging in combat at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: No, just as advisors. A lot of military advisors for the Afghan
                    troops.</p>
                <p>I was surprised by the actual invasion for two reasons. One, I didn't think the
                    government of Afghanistan was in that much danger of being toppled. I mean, they
                    weren't very close to a military defeat. Also, it seemed to me that the Soviets
                    could accomplish their purpose just by continuing what they were doing which was
                    infiltrating, you know, a 1,000 a week or something like that until they had
                    more and more and more troops in there rather than coming in suddenly. The only
                    reason I can see for it was they had to get rid of Amin, and they . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, if they also felt they were going to need a 100,000
                        troops, they couldn't do that incrementally.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes. Well, they could have done—</p>

                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did you do, though, that made the Soviets not want
                        you as charg� on a permanent basis? What do you suppose you did? Or what do
                        they think you did?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: They didn't give any specific reason. My own favorite reason is that in
                    New Delhi we had been operating a program whereby we each week brought in
                    American and other western journalists—the political section did this—and
                    briefed them on what was going on in Afghanistan based on reports from our
                    embassy. In those days, no foreign correspondents were getting into Afghanistan.
                    And our idea was, of course, to keep Afghanistan alive as a story. Of course, we
                    played up any successes of the resistance and any troubles that the government
                    had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were based on reports from your embassy in
                        Kabul?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes. The Indians didn't like this. And, of course, we had—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: George Griffin.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: George Griffin was up there then. He came down because his wife was here,
                    and we would chat with him. We were getting quite a bit of information. And the
                    Indians didn't like this particularly. Of course, I'm sure the Afghans didn't
                    like it. Most of the stories that appeared in the American press or the European
                    press at the time were coming out of these briefings. That's my feeling.</p>
                <p>Now the Indian ambassador in Kabul, a fellow named Monty Diction, was Indian high
                    commissioner in Sri Lanka in 1986 when I stopped there. We talked about this. He
                    said that he had gone to the Afghans and asked why that they turned me down
                    because we had known each other. He had been the press spokesman for the foreign
                    ministry. They said because he had had secret meetings with Amin. And I told him
                    that was not true. I had had the one meeting that I mentioned with you with Amin
                    and no others.</p>
                <p>But I think another reason may have been that some Afghans, hostile to the
                    regime, knowing that I had served in Afghanistan, when they came through Delhi,
                    would call on me and chat with me.</p>
                <p>Anyhow, they said anybody but him. The Department decided not to send anybody,
                    instead to have Charlie Dunbar, who was the number two—he would have been my
                    number two—that he would become charg� which worked out very well for
                    Charlie.</p>

                <p>BLOOD: No, I was going to be charg�. No ambassador. No, we weren't going to send

                <p>BLOOD: But Charlie would have stayed on, and he would have been the number two.
                    But then they decided they wouldn't put anybody else in. It worked out well for
                    Charlie. A good man.</p>

                    ambassador to India but couldn't get out there for a while. He picked the DCM,
                    Marion Quickmore. Marion came out a month before I was to leave so we would have
                    an overlap. I still acted as charg�. And I guess he acted as DCM in a way. Then
                    I left, I think October 1 of '81. Marion was charg� until Harry got there a
                    couple weeks later.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, it was a period of deteriorating relations with India because of our
                    arms sales to Pakistan. The Indians were protesting this loud.</p>
                <p>

                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>BLOOD: My own personal relations with the Indians in the foreign office still
                    remained very good. I think . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was really a Reagan Administration policy that they
                        were objecting to then, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes. But it was a quid pro quo. It was all I had to do with Afghanistan.
                    Sometimes we would tell them that quite frankly, you know, you are out of line
                    on Afghanistan not the rest of us. I mean, most of the Third World is in the
                    same wicket we are.</p>
                <p>It was still a very, very pleasant post, even though you do put up with these,
                    you know, official announcements of unhappiness with the United States. But it
                    didn't reflect in the personal relationships with the Indians at all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you left, and then you came back to Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Came back to Washington, didn't know what was in store. Found out that
                    there wasn't much in store. Then NEA asked if I wanted to go out to Kabul as
                    charg�. Of course, it would have meant that I couldn't take my wife but was, you
                    know, hardship pay and danger pay and besides it was a very interesting
                    situation even though it is difficult to report on a country when you are
                    virtually locked in an embassy. I said I was willing to do it. I started
                    studying Dari at the FSI and going through briefings and getting myself
                    prepared.</p>
                <p>Then they refused the visa and then I decided pretty shortly after that—I sort of
                    checked around again and there didn't seem to be anything interesting. I wasn't
                    really keen on staying in Washington unless there was a good job.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why Archer do you suppose—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: There was a shift in NEA. The deputy secretary for SOA became available,
                    but Howie Schaffer got that. That would have been a possibility, but that was
                    ruled out.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right. Nick Veliotes would have been—well, he was
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Nick was still assistant secretary. There was deputy secretaryship in the
                    office that handles nuclear matters that I thought I could . . . I had a lot of
                    experience in that. They still hadn't filled that position when I retired. It
                    was sort of a disorganized outfit there.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But why do you suppose that you didn't get your earthly
                        reward of the Carter Administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, I found out that I came very close to it.</p>
                <p>Sri Lanka became open. And I remember Jay Coon came by from Washington and told
                    me that I was the bureau's candidate for Sri Lanka. But he said, “Don't get your
                    hopes up, because it's going to a political.”</p>
                <p>So I said, “Okay, thanks for telling me. I appreciate the vote of confidence.”
                    Then I found out, it didn't go to a political. What happened was that Dave
                    Newsom, who was Under Secretary for Political Affairs, intervened and pushed for
                    his former DCM in Indonesia. He had been the ambassador in Indonesia right
                    before that. Oh, what's his name? He has since died.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Don Touissant.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Don Touissant, who had never been in South Asia at all in his life, but an
                    able fellow. So I didn't get it. But I think if that hadn't happened, I think
                    NEA would have . . . And it hadn't gone to White House candidate that I was the
                    bureau's candidate for it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes. Oh, some unhappiness, yes.</p>

                <p>BLOOD: Oh, I didn't expect that. I think the—</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why? Why didn't you expect it? You don't think the Foreign

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, if you antagonize somebody like Kissinger, and Kissinger becomes
                    Secretary of State or is influential in the halls of an administration, I can
                    see why the Department is not going to antagonize him by not giving me some job,
                    yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even when under a Democratic administration you don't
                        think they would?</hi>

                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>BLOOD: Well, as I say, yes, there was no problem there. I think the Sri Lanka
                    thing was close. I mean, that's just maneuverings within the Department. I think
                    the bureau was pushing for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: So from that point of view, I think that was my only opportunity once was
                    during the Carter Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as DCM in New Delhi you probably had as good a
                        job—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, I think so, too.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You could have had in the subcontinent.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: And I was charg� there for, oh I guess all told, it must have been two
                    years. The ambassador was away quite a bit of the time. He had two heart attacks
                    while I was there and triple surgery, and so he was away and I was left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you know, your career spanned forty years almost,
                        thirty-five.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Thirty-five.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Thirty-five years. What kind of change did you see in the
                        Foreign Service? I mean, do you have the same high regard for the Foreign
                        Service when you left at the end? The caliber of its personnel, its high
                        principles and so forth?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Not completely. I had seen people who I don't respect get to the top of
                    the Foreign Service, career officers. Tactics that I wouldn't admire. I don't
                    like that. I think there has been an exaggerated emphasis on the Foreign Service
                    and its management aspects more than negotiating and understanding and
                    interpreting foreign cultures and viewpoints. I think that has gone
                    overboard.</p>
                <p>I think the whole aspect of the spousal relationship has changed into so many
                    officers who are serving and their wives don't accompany them to post. They
                    serve there. The married couples has drastically changed. Couples being able to
                    serve together at a post has changed the Foreign Service a great deal and not to
                    the better.</p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>It seems to be they continue to get very, very able people. I was struck when I
                    went around the world a semester at sea because all the ports where we had
                    hosts, there were briefings arranged usually by junior officers. I would usually
                    introduce them to the students, and then have a chance before and after to chat
                    with them. And I was struck by the very low morale.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Low morale?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Very low morale.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was in 1986?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: '86, yes. Junior officers. Mostly because of the politization of the upper
                    ranks of the Foreign Service. I read the latest newsletter. Seventeen new
                    ambassadors, I didn't see one career ambassador there. All of them. I don't know
                    whether we brought it down upon ourselves or not. There certainly is an idea
                    among politicals that people from outside the career can do the job as well as
                    we can. Of course, in many cases, they can.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, some of them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: There is no doubt about it. Some are very, very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you a little about Congress' role. That has
                        also changed a great deal in thirty-five years.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Being towards the end, they sort of complicated your life
                        in India in a very important sense. In the beginning, it probably had very
                        little impact.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Little impact, yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Except for the law passing put you into the visa business
                        for years. Would you comment on that?</hi>

                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>BLOOD: In a way, that's one of the more exciting and rewarding aspects, I think,
                    has been dealing with Congress, mostly in the occasion of visits. I always found
                    them interesting. I think it is because of the experience in Bangladesh, but I
                    welcome a fairly strong congressional oversight over foreign policy to keep the
                    executive branch honest.</p>
                <p>I think what I object to is this spate of recent legislation which imposed sort
                    of automatic penalties through the cutting of aid and assistance to countries
                    who take actions of which we do not approve which doesn't give the executive
                    branch much leeway and leverage and flexibility. I think that, in the whole,
                    those are not helpful at all. This is a trend that has been, I think, damaging
                    to our foreign relations.</p>
                <p>But we have a real need for our congressional oversight to . . . I've seen our
                    government lie enough that somebody has got to, besides the press, has to be on
                    the—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about the press? How do they stack up in

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, great. Great, I think. I worked very closely with them particularly in
                    India.</p>
                <p>It is a, you know, two-way street. We can be helpful to them because we give them
                    our honest evaluation of the situation, say, within a country. They can be
                    helpful because they often have much greater access than we do because somebody
                    who is writing in the New York Times can see, say, Mrs. Gandhi much more readily
                    than I could. They would often see us before they saw Mrs. Gandhi. We could
                    plant questions through them. They would debrief us after their meeting, and
                    tell us things that they weren't using in the story because they thought it
                    might be interesting to us. It is sort of a symbiotic relationship that was very
                    productive.</p>
                <p>You get to know these people. They are mainly in the same business we are in, I
                    think, except they are not working for the US Government.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Yes, yes. Well, I mentioned the one exception in East Pakistan. I think
                    that's the only one I know of where somebody violated a confidence. I think the
                    same was true of the Indian press. They are very, very able, and we worked very
                    closely with them. You get to trust each other. It can be dangerous—</p>

                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh, yes, you shouldn't do that. I think you can let them know that you
                    can't answer a question. I mean, you don't tell them lies, but you just tell
                    them, “I'm sorry, I can't tell you that.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of telling lies—maybe that's not the right
                        connective to use—but what about your assessment of Dr. Kissinger? How does
                        he stack up as the leader of the US foreign affairs during his tenure in
                        your view? Tell me your perspective. In East Pakistan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BLOOD: Oh. Well, let's take Cyprus as an even better example. I think where he
                    showed up the worst has been issues like East Pakistan and Cyprus which were
                    peripheral interests from his point of view. Areas in which he had not been
                    concerned at all beforehand, suddenly a crisis brew, and he involved
                    himself.</p>
                <p>In the case of Cyprus—I know because I intended to try and follow the best which
                    I could even though I was no longer connected with Cyprus—he disregarded the
                    views of the professionals in the State Department. He always saw everything as
                    a geopolitical contest with the Soviet Union. Whereas more likely than not, it
                    was a regional interest without any really great geopolitical concerns.</p>
                <p>In the case of Cyprus, when Makarios was overthrown by a coup engineered by the
                    Greek junta, and they put in a murdered and a thug in his place, we should have
                    denounced that. As everybody in the State Department felt we should. This is a
                    thing we don't tolerate. He didn't denounce it. He was playing for time, hoping
                    to work something out. He didn't like Makarios. And by so doing, it ended up as
                    a disaster for us. The Turks moved in. Our relations with Turkey suffered. Our
                    relations with Greece suffered. The junta fell, that was the only good thing
                    that came out of it. That wasn't what Kissinger wanted.</p>

                <p>And if we had done the right, moral thing directly in the beginning, it might
                    have changed the situation. But the Machiavellian approach, the manipulative
                    approach, I think can often backfire.</p>
