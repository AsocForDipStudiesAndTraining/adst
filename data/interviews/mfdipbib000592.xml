                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is May 12, 1995. This is an interview with Julius L.
                        Katz, being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies, and
                        I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. I wonder if we could start by at the beginning.
                        Can you tell me when and where you were born, and a little about your
                        family, to begin with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes, I was born in New York City in 1925. I lived there until I was 18. I
                    left then to go to war.</p>
                <p>I returned late in December of 1945 and in September of 1946, I went off to
                    attend The George Washington University.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your father?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: My father and mother were immigrants. They came to the United States, I
                    think in 1914.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A good time to get the hell out of Europe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Just ahead of World War I. They came from an area which was called
                    Bessarabia, which at the time was Austro-Hungary and later became Poland and
                    Russia, and maybe Romania, and now maybe Moldova. They lived in a little
                    community that now probably no longer exists. I could never find it on a
                    map.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did your father do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: He was a carpenter to start with, and then became a milliner, and they were
                    very much middle class, or working class.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pretty much the immigrant, working one's way up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Very much so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: I went to high school in Brooklyn. I spent most of my youth in Brooklyn. I
                    was born in Manhattan, but then the family moved to Brooklyn when I was very
                    young. I went to Lafayette High School and went to Brooklyn College for one year
                    right after the start of the war, with my mind elsewhere, not terribly serious
                    about it, wondering why I was going at all. I was in a pre-engineering program
                    for which I was eminently ill-prepared. For some reason, I enrolled in the
                    summer session at the end of the first academic year, and just barely got
                    through that before I entered the army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went in the army when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: In August of 1943.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was very hard for any man of your age to take anything
                        seriously, when you knew that the military was going to take over.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: In fact I had applied earlier, just before I was 18, for a meteorology
                    program, in the Air Force, and I was about three weeks too young to get into
                    that, so I ended up being drafted, and went to South Carolina for basic
                    training. I was accepted for ASTP, the college training program, had my bus
                    tickets and orders, and the day before I was to leave those were canceled and
                    just before Christmas of 1943 went on home leave and then reported to Fort Dix
                    for transport to Europe. I spent two or three months on top of a hill in
                    Cornwall, in England, awaiting the invasion of France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you assigned to a particular unit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Infantry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What division?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>KATZ: Well, I was a replacement. I was in one of the early replacement packages
                    right after D-Day. I think I landed on D plus five and reported to the 90th
                    Infantry Division.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the 90th Infantry? Was that a ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: It was a Texas and Oklahoma division, but I think that was World War I. By
                    World War II, it was really Texas to the Dakotas. It was basically a Midwest
                    division. And by the time I joined it, I was in the second replacement package,
                    so there were not very many of the original people left. The unit had been just
                    about decimated when we got there. My regiment, the 359th, landed on Utah Beach
                    as a backup regiment for the 4th Infantry Division, and so they went in on
                    D-Day, and there weren't very many left of them by the time we got there.</p>
                <p>We fought through the Hedge Row country of Normandy. We went through St. Lo,
                    after the massive bombing, and participated in the closing of the Falaise Gap,
                    which trapped thousands of German troops. After the breakthrough of the German
                    lines we sped across France, walking and being trucked until we reached the
                    south of Paris. We then went on to Rennes. We crossed the Saar River and fought
                    bitterly to maintain a slender foothold over the river, but just as we began to
                    widen our penetration we were pulled back to go up to the Battle of the
                    Bulge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you with Patton?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes. Mostly with the 3rd Army, but there was a time when we were with the
                    7th Army. We went up to the Bulge to relieve some units there, and then
                    ultimately crossed into Germany. Although we mostly raced across Germany, there
                    were pockets of resistance and little battles and skirmishes. And then we found
                    ourselves on our way to attack Plzen when the word came that the war was over.
                    We had moved into Czechoslovakia. We had stopped just before that to take the
                    surrender of a Panzer armed division which was fleeing from the Russians, and
                    after we had finished that, we were moving on toward Plzen when the war
                    ended.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you stay, or were you moved out rather quickly from
                        Europe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: No, I stayed there and the Division moved into Camp Grafenwohr, which was a
                    huge prewar German army camp, and, I believe, still exists. I stayed there until
                    just before Christmas. In fact, we were anxiously awaiting news about the war in
                    the Pacific and some people had begun to be transferred there and I wasn't
                    particularly looking forward to that. But the Division stayed intact and then
                    were demobilized in Germany, and then got back home right after Christmas.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The end of 1945.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: By then I had decided that I was interested in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did that come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Well, I guess I was lying in my bunk one night and hearing advertisements
                    on Armed Forces Radio, AFN. There was an announcement about an exam for the
                    Foreign Service and I thought, well, that sounds like it might be interesting.
                    Of course, I had virtually no college at that point. So when I got back home I
                    went to the New York Public Library and started going through college catalogs
                    and found three schools that had foreign affairs or foreign service programs.
                    One was Lafayette College, another was Georgetown, and the other was George
                    Washington. Georgetown just didn't seem right; I didn't know what a Jewish boy
                    from Brooklyn would be doing at a Jesuit school, which it turns out was a wrong
                    judgment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's like today, President Bill Clinton was a Baptist boy
                        from Arkansas, and ended up here too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: I liked the idea of going to school in Washington, so I decided on GW. But
                    first, I had a problem with my prior grades, because I had done very poorly in
                    that one year at Brooklyn College. So I was actually admitted on probation, but
                    did quite well there, ending up with a 3.49 grade average.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to get a feel, what was the international relations
                        course like at GW?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: It basically had a very heavy emphasis on history, political science, and
                    economics. And then in my senior year, I did 30 hours of economics and then did
                    a graduate year in economics. So I moved toward economics, but I also was very
                    heavily into political science and international law.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there much connection with the State Department?I
                        mean, it was right down the street.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>KATZ: No; there were a number of instructors or professors who had some
                    connection with State or with Commerce; either had worked for or some who taught
                    at night. I don't remember at that point anybody in particular with a State
                    Department connection, except an economics professor, who was Ted Acheson,
                    Edward C. Acheson, who was Dean Acheson's brother. In fact, I worked for him as
                    a graduate assistant, grading papers and occasionally taking a lecture for him.
                    He wrote letters of introduction for me to various people which didn't
                    accomplish much of anything.</p>
                <p>By then I was married and I wasn't sure I wanted to take the Foreign Service
                    exam, but I took a Civil Service exam, which was called the JPA, the Junior
                    Professional Assistant, which just about everybody passed. But then, my wife
                    suggested why not take the second part of that exam, which was the JMA, the
                    Junior Management Assistant. I had some doubts about that since I knew know
                    anything about management, nor did I have any management training. On the
                    theory, nothing ventured nothing lost, I took the JMA. Well, it turned out that
                    was a more difficult exam, and there were very many fewer people that took it,
                    and even fewer people who passed it. And then if one passed the written exam,
                    then there was an oral interview before a three-person board or committee, not
                    unlike the Foreign Service exam. I scored very high on the exams and ended up
                    being something like one of 37 people in the country who had come through the
                    process. And at that point, I not only had no difficulty finding employment, I
                    was solicited by various agencies. I had my pick and of course, my first choice
                    was the State Department. So I went in as a JMA, but not in a management job. I
                    went into EUR, the Bureau of European Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What got you, by the time you reached graduate school,
                        what moved you toward the economic field as a concentration by your senior
                        year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: I'm not really sure, because I was really very interested in international
                    law. I don't really recall what moved me in that direction. It may have been
                    that there were better courses, or more courses.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes one's whole life is moved because of what is
                        offered at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: It's an interesting question, and I really have no good answer for it. And
                    in retrospect, if I had it to do all over again, I probably wouldn't have done
                    that, because of what has happened to economics. Its become so mathematical and
                    I was not really mathematically inclined, as my pre-engineering attempt
                    demonstrated. Although, I don't know, perhaps if I had greater interest and
                    concentration I may have done better in math. I did rather well in the first
                    economics courses, and having done the year, I felt encouraged to go on with it,
                    and do the graduate year. I probably never could have done a doctorate because,
                    as I said, it was becoming increasingly econometric.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KATZ: I went to European Affairs, to the Office of Eastern European Affairs, EE,
                    and one of my first office mates was Claiborne Pell, just before he left the
                    Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But he had been in Bratislava?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: He had been in Bratislava and he came back, and he was a special assistant
                    to the Director, as I recall. He was not on a desk. But I was put in the
                    economic staff of EE.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was EE? What did it comprise of?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: It comprised the Soviet Union, and all of Eastern Europe, or Central
                    Europe, as it is now called. It was basically all the European countries of the
                    Communist bloc. Relations were, of course, deteriorating fast in those days. We
                    had ministers, of course, in Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria where we had
                    legations, instead of embassies. There was some discussion at one staff meeting
                    on whether we ought to withdraw our missions and make them consulates, i.e., go
                    from legations to consulates, because we regarded the countries as complete
                    puppets of the Soviet Union. In 1949, we had broken relations with Bulgaria over
                    some incident, this was before I got there, and soon after I got there had been
                    several incidents with Czechoslovakia, and then in 1951 they had imprisoned a
                    newspaperman whose name escapes me now, and that led to a series of sanctions to
                    gain his release, which took quite a long time, some months or perhaps a
                    year.</p>
                <p>I remember Ellis Briggs was our ambassador at the time. He was a marvelous writer
                    and very gifted with phrases. And there was one particular incident where
                    Czechoslovakia was inflicted with a potato bug, and they had this big propaganda
                    campaign, alleging that the U.S. was responsible. Briggs wrote a note taking
                    strong issue with the allegations, but concluding with that he could not believe
                    that even so voracious a pest as, and then gave the Latin name for the potato
                    beetle, could nibble at the fabric of Czech-American friendship.</p>

                        looking at the beast rather closely at that time in the 1950s of the economy
                        of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Well, the area was very poor, underdeveloped and barely recovered from the
                    war. The Soviet style economy was highly inefficient. There was great privation
                    on the part of people. Resources preponderantly were going into the military,
                    and I can recall discussion of the annual budgets, and trying to analyze them.
                    DRS, Division of Research of the Soviet Area in INR, the Bureau of Intelligence
                    and Research, used to spend a lot of time analyzing the budget and trying to
                    figure how much was actually going into the military. The so-called satellite
                    countries at the time were especially in dire straits, and they of course, were
                    being bled in terms of trade, and they were ruthlessly exploited by the
                    Soviets.</p>
                <p>Our relations with the so-called satellites deteriorated steadily. In 1951, the
                    Trade Act took away MFN, most-favored-nation treatment. There was a provision in
                    law which required the President to remove most-favored nation treatment from
                    the USSR and countries controlled or dominated by the country or organization
                    dominating the world communist movement. In a number of cases we had treaties
                    with those countries, providing for MFN treatment and so we had to serve notice
                    to abrogate the agreements. Our economic relations dwindled rapidly. One major
                    issue at the time were the nationalization claims which resulted from the
                    expropriation of property by the communists in all of the countries and in some
                    cases there were war claims with former enemy states, Hungary and Romania.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Meaning if there was German or Italian money in sort of in
                        escrow that would pay . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Well, no — there wasn't. Those countries were held accountable themselves.
                    Hungary and Romania were and Bulgaria were enemy states and so there were claims
                    against them for takings and damage to property of the United States and of
                    American citizens. Of course, there were not a whole lot of American citizens
                    there prewar, but there was some, and there was U.S. Government property. But
                    then there were the nationalization claims and those were rather substantial. I
                    became substantially involved in efforts to resolve these issues.</p>
                <p>I also spent a fair amount of time in those early years working on Soviet
                    Lend-Lease negotiations. In fact, that was really my first assignment after my
                    first week there. I was asked to draft a diplomatic note demanding the return of
                    three ice breakers and 27 frigates that we had provided the Russians under
                    Lend-Lease. It was extremely good training in diplomatic correspondence and
                    negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel? Was it sort of, well, we've got to do
                        this but we'll never get these back? Was that then the feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>KATZ: No, well, in fact, we did get them back. We got the ships back, and the ice
                    breakers were particularly useful. When they were sent to the Russians in
                    1944-45, they were state-of-the-art craft. They were named after the four winds
                    - East Wind, South Wind, etc. We ultimately got the three ice breakers back, and
                    were used by the Coast Guard for many years thereafter. And while some people
                    questioned why we wanted the frigates back, some of them were actually used in
                    the Korean War. So I thought our efforts were worthwhile.</p>
                <p>The financial negotiations went on for decades. We finally got a financial
                    settlement of something like $300 million, but I had left Soviet Affairs by then
                    and was not involved. Buanyway, as I noted, my earlier involvement in the
                    negotiations was valuable training in drafting diplomatic notes, preparing
                    position papers and in participating in the negotiations. After a few years, I
                    was conducting some of the negotiations myself. I remember my counterpart on the
                    other side of the table was Dobrynin, who was then Minister in the Soviet
                    Embassy in Washington. In fact, years later after he became the Ambassador here,
                    and Foreign Minister, when we encountered one another, we would joke and
                    reminisce about those old days of Lend-Lease negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find; did you learn there was a Soviet style
                        of negotiation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Oh yes. Of course there were a lot of jokes about it. We used to refer to
                    them reading and rereading from their dog-eared files. They would read the same
                    speeches over and over again. As a matter of fact, after a very short time,
                    about a year of this, I could anticipate exactly what they would say. I sat next
                    to our negotiator, Walt Stoessel was the second negotiator I worked for, and I
                    would listen to the Russian — I did not speak Russian but I could get enough of
                    it and knew the context of the speech that was coming — and I would write out
                    some talking points for the response before they were finished on the other
                    side. Walt would use that for his response. In truth there was more speech
                    making than true negotiations.</p>
                <p>That was one of the problems. They owed the money and there was a clear
                    obligation on their part, but that didn't cut a whole lot of ice. When the
                    settlement finally came, it was part of a larger package of economic
                    agreements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about this early period in the Fifties; how
                        did you feel about the economic reporting from the Soviet Union,
                        particularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>KATZ: Well, in the early '50s I would say it was reasonably good, but it was
                    beginning to get closed off pretty quickly. It was good in the sense that there
                    was a fairly good idea of what was happening to their industrial production. It
                    was exceptionally good on agricultural production because there was a model that
                    was created by a man named Michaels, I believe, who had been at the Department
                    of Agriculture, but then also CIA, and sort of back and forth. But it was a
                    model that was based on weather — sun and rainfall essentially — and acres
                    planted, less harvesting losses. And in fact, I think our crop estimates were
                    probably better than what the Soviets themselves were able to estimate. But of
                    course increasingly as the Iron Curtain descended, it became more and more
                    difficult, so the reporting became more indirect, searching for little clues in
                    newspapers. Of course travel then became restricted and reporting became
                    increasingly difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it easier to get information from the satellite
                        countries, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Same problems. Official information was sparse and not very accurate. Some
                    of it was designed to withhold information, some of it reflected just the
                    inadequacies of their own statistical services. So it wasn't really very good.
                    In retrospect, we knew that there was an enormous capacity to burden the
                    civilian population at the expense of the military and they were able to build
                    considerable military power, but in the end, what we missed was the permeability
                    of the iron curtain and the inevitability that the economy would crumble. Now
                    that took several decades, but I think one of the lessons is that what was
                    missed. We knew that it was a crumbling economy but we just didn't know how bad
                    it was, and what the level of toleration of the population was. The time of the
                    Hungarian Revolution, for example, 1956, that was something of a revelation,
                    because we had begun to think that as there was generational change there
                    wouldn't be people that had any knowledge of or recollection of , or
                    appreciation of democracy and freedom. But in the Hungarian Revolution it was
                    the young people that led the fight. It wasn't the old folks. And that is what
                    ultimately happened in the Soviet Union itself.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Well, and it turns out that the iron curtain was much less impermeable than
                    we believed. After the collapse of the Soviet Union you found rock bands in
                    Central Asia. Where did they come from? How did they know about this?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel the CIA supported you; was there much
                        cooperation at that time, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes, there was quite a lot of collaboration, and they had a very strong
                    organization on the Soviet economy. I thought at the time they were doing a
                    fairly good job. Now this was mostly through the '50s.</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to stick to the '50s; we can then sort of hit it
                        in decades.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: I think they portrayed a pretty good picture of what was happening,
                    essentially the capability of the economy to support the armament of the USSR
                    and to some extent the countries of Eastern Europe as well. And despite the iron
                    curtain, I think we knew pretty well what was going on. There was another major
                    activity at that point, and that was what might be called denial, and that was
                    the export control program. And a lot of what the CIA was doing was really
                    providing intelligence to determine where the holes were in the economy and what
                    the Soviets were trying to get their hands on. Now, in retrospect, well I
                    shouldn't say altogether in retrospect - even by the late '50s it was clear to a
                    number of us that the export control program was really excessively restrictive
                    and self-defeating. We were attempting to control things that really didn't make
                    all that much difference. I remember arguments, for example, over petrochemical
                    plants. It was clear that what the Soviets were doing was purchasing technology
                    which was current but would be very quickly obsolete by the time it took to
                    install it. They just were unable to maintain state of the art technology in a
                    whole lot of areas, and the export control program was probably a nuisance, but
                    not a whole lot more than that. Q: During this period, Yugoslavia took a
                    different turn, and we got involved with that. How did that play?</p>
                <p>KATZ: I began working on Yugoslavia in 1951. Of course, Tito broke away from
                    Moscow in 1948-49, but by 1950 there was a major crop failure followed by crop
                    failures in subsequent years, and we became more and more involved in an aid
                    program there.</p>
                <p>Because of the significance of Tito's break away from Soviet domination it was
                    important that the Yugoslavian economy be sustained. Yugoslavia was not,
                    however, in the Marshall Plan and we had limited authorized resources available.
                    That led to a Tripartite Aid Program, with the British and French which was
                    maintained for several years. Our contributions consisted primarily of food aid,
                    along with some Export-Import Bank loans. By mid-1951, we had the beginnings of
                    an aid mission in Belgrade and the aid program became more traditional in U.S.
                    terms, with project assistance, commodity support, technical assistance and
                    military assistance as well. Late in the decade, after the Hungarian Revolution,
                    and the events in Poland in 1956-57, I then took over responsibility for the
                    Yugoslav and Polish aid programs. I was heavily involved in managing those
                    programs. Also I conducted a nationalization claims negotiations with Poland,
                    and pursued a legislative effort to restore most-favored nation treatment to
                    Poland, which became associated with the claims agreement.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the '50s, with Poland, here you are sitting in the
                        State Department but, you take Chicago. Chicago has got more Poles in it
                        than Warsaw. The Polish influence politically is considerable. Was that a
                        factor in changing things around, from your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>KATZ: There's a very interesting contrast between the Polish and Yugoslav
                    emigrations. The Yugoslav aid program was always controversial. Not so much
                    immediately because Tito's defection was a major event, a stunning event and
                    extremely important, and what people hoped would be the beginning of the end of
                    the Communist bloc. Ultimately it was, but it took a long time. The Yugoslav
                    emigre community, however, was very fractured. That would not seem very
                    surprising now, but there was still bitter enmity between the Serbs and Croats
                    going back to World War II. It was primarily the Croatian community that was
                    extremely hostile to any aid to the Communist Tito.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KATZ: On the other hand, there was no great division of opinion among the Polish
                    community in the U.S. After 1956, Gomulka came in and introduced some changes in
                    Poland, there was a great deal of support for aid to Poland. In fact, Poland
                    began to open up, and there was a lot of travel back and forth. But there had
                    always been a substantial level of financial remittances to Poland, and I
                    suppose to Yugoslavia as well. In fact, to all of the Eastern European
                    countries. Indeed, there were a number of people living there, in all of the
                    countries, but especially Poland, who were retirees from the United States, and
                    getting U.S. government checks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know, I was Consul in Belgrade from 1962-67, and my main
                        job was going out and making sure that people were getting their social
                        security, railroad pensions, veterans' checks - a big source of income at
                        that time. What was your impression of how aid was working? You're looking
                        at this as an economic person rather than just sort of an AID person where
                        they get concentrated on projects. How did you feel? Did you have to be
                        careful about Poland, that we were giving aid, but after all it was part of
                        the Soviet military force at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Well, I don't think there was much concern about diversion. There were
                    concerns, of course, as to whether it was being used effectively. In terms of
                    getting to people, I think it was. I think people benefitted from it. But was it
                    economically sound, that is, were they engaged in projects that made sense for
                    the country? And, of course, there was always the concern whether the money
                    would be repaid. I think most of the loans are being repaid, although there have
                    been several reshedulings, or stretch outs of payments. Yugoslavia, in
                    particular, took on a lot of debt and I was involved in one of the early debt
                    rescheduling efforts in 1959. I went to Europe with Douglas Dillon to persuade
                    European countries to reschedule debt with Yugoslavia.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>In the case of Poland, much of what we did was PL 480, mainly sales of grain for
                    local currency. And that generated a great deal of local currency. The
                    arrangement was that we were paid in Polish Zloty and then we had to figure out
                    what to do with that. Some of it was programmed back into aid projects. One
                    project I was involved in was the building of a children's hospital. A Polish
                    emigre here took that on as a life's work, and got a lot of support from
                    Congress. Congressman Zablocki, who was Chairman of the Foreign Affairs
                    Committee, Senator Hubert Humphrey, and others. Ultimately the hospital was
                    built, largely with local currency funds, plus private dollar contributions from
                    the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Yugoslavia, what was your impression of how our aid
                        functioned there? Was it pretty well invested?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: There was a lot of concern that, first of all, the agricultural commodities
                    provided had the effect enabling the Yugoslavs to pursue bad agricultural
                    policy, that is, maintaining collective farms, not providing adequate prices to
                    farmers so as to provide domestic incentives to grow their own food. And in
                    fact, I think there was probably some justification for that because as food aid
                    began to be tapered down, they did become more self-sufficient. The other aid we
                    provided was balance of payments support primarily in the form of commodities,
                    plus project loans via the Export-Import Bank. There was a little bit of
                    Marshall Plan money, but the greatest part of our aid, other than agriculture,
                    was military aid, and we provided quite a lot of military equipment. In fact,
                    some of the proceeds of our agricultural sales, the local currency component of
                    our agricultural sales, went into military projects. Some were dual-use, like
                    building the Adriatic Highway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And quite a bit of railroad equipment, if I recall.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: That probably came out of the early Ex-Im loans. I think all of that did
                    ultimately help to erode the communist system. Of course, the Yugoslavs adopted
                    their peculiar brand of socialism, with some success stories, and many more
                    failures. But, I think it helped to erode the communist ideology, not only in
                    Yugoslavia, but elsewhere. Whether the aid was effective in economic terms, is I
                    think arguable. But recall that the basic purpose was to support Tito, or as a
                    British colleague put it. “to keep the bloody bastard afloat”.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Oh, it was always very creaky and always in serious straits.</p>

                <p>KATZ: Similarly, they were struggling, with badly functioning economies. In 1956,
                    just before, well almost at the same time as the outbreak of the Hungarian
                    Revolution . . .</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which I think is in October 1956.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes, on October 8, 1956 I went to Romania to lead a delegation to discuss
                    for the first time following World War II a whole series of bilateral issues.
                    The Romanians were just beginning to try to emerge from under the domination of
                    the Soviets. It was a day or two after my arrival in Bucharest that the
                    revolution broke out in Hungary. Of course, at the same time things were
                    erupting in Poland as well. It was a rather exciting time to be there.</p>
                <p>I was there for three weeks discussing economic, financial and consular problems.
                    All of the borders were closed and we were quite cut off from the outside world,
                    except for BBC, which we listened to avidly. After our talks had concluded, we
                    even had trouble getting out of there because of the closed borders. Ultimately,
                    they put on a special flight so that we and other travelers could get out
                    through Czechoslovakia. But it was clear that there was a great deal of ferment
                    in the area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Romanians, did you sense on the part of the people you
                        were negotiating or in contact with that they were wondering what was going
                        to happen in their country?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Oh yes, they were clearly very preoccupied. But at the time Romania was a
                    pitifully poor country. Walking down the streets was depressing. There were no
                    goods in the shops. The people just looked sad, spiritless. But there were
                    people in the government who were beginning to look for an opening. These talks
                    were really initiated by them and they were clearly looking for some kind of
                    relationship with the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any dealings with Czechoslovakia?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>KATZ: Yes, primarily financial negotiations. And in fact, we stopped there
                    briefly on the way back, well really to transit. But there had been negotiations
                    going on there. There was a major incentive on the part of the Czechs to reach
                    agreement with us. We had ended up being custodians of, together with the
                    British and French, of a large stock of gold, which had been looted by the
                    Nazis, that could not be released without our agreement. Notwithstanding that,
                    the Czechs were not very ready to come to an agreement, which turned out to be
                    to their ultimate advantage, because the price of gold went from $35.00 to
                    hundreds of dollars subsequently. In time, we did conclude an agreement, and
                    then it got held up here because one of the claimants, the Aris glove family,
                    got to Senator Long of Louisiana, who was Chairman of the Finance Committee. And
                    he held up the agreement. So it was some years after I had left Eastern European
                    Affairs that the agreement was finally concluded and the gold returned.Probably
                    wasn't until the 1980s that was finally done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then they did come out ahead. Did you find in our dealings
                        with Eastern Europe how did we work with say, the French and the British.
                        They were our major allies there. Did you find there was disagreement on the
                        economic interpretation or in negotiating...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Well, we worked very closely with them. In the first days, not in the
                    earliest days of Tito's break, but by 1950 the aid program, as I said, was a
                    tripartite aid program, with contributions from the British and the French. Our
                    share was much larger than theirs, but they did play a role. The French dropped
                    out pretty quickly, and the British contribution was dwindling primarily because
                    of their own financial problems. And so ultimately it became a U.S. program. But
                    there were other areas of cooperation. For example, there was the COCOM
                    operation, which dealt with export controls. There was close cooperation, but at
                    the same time a lot of disagreement. The U.S. always tended to want to do more
                    than our allies; either we were more restrictive or more generous, for example
                    with regard to aid programs. We tended toward some excess, with the others being
                    more reserved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On another subject, but I want to stay with the '50s
                        still. You were in the Department. Did you feel the heavy hand of
                        McCarthyism or any reflection of that on others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Not personally, but I do recall that in the early '50s there was an
                    atmosphere that was quite uncomfortable, particularly in '51 and '52. I remember
                    one person who resigned from the Bureau under pressure and that was kind of an
                    unsettling experience. And then at the end of the Truman administration, when
                    Dean Acheson, Secretary Acheson, gave a farewell speech on the back steps of the
                    old State Department building, that was kind of a moving experience. He turned
                    it into a tribute to all of the employees of the Department. And then several
                    days later, the new Secretary, John Foster Dulles, appeared on the same spot,
                    addressing the same group of people, saying that from now on we are going to
                    demand positive loyalty. And so that was an unhappy time.</p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't tell you how many times that positive loyalty
                        thing and that contrast between those two things have come up with people
                        who served in Washington at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: I remember it vividly. Apart from that, I had no personal involvement. It
                    was environmental, not something that affected me directly. And there was at the
                    time a reduction in force, which came in 1953, which was also somewhat
                    unsettling. It did not personally affect me, but affected other people, and I
                    began to wonder whether I wanted to stay. In fact, I had initially come into the
                    State Department not thinking about it as a career. I thought it was something I
                    would want to do for several years and gain some experience, and then go on to
                    do something else. After 25 years I finally decided that I probably had
                    inadvertently committed myself to a career. But I never really felt that I was
                    part of the system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I must say, we're talking about the '50s, your coming in
                        then, that you certainly were leading delegations, doing this sort of thing
                        or even being number two in the delegation; you were finding yourself with
                        much more authority than you would have if you had been a foreign service
                        officer.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes, absolutely. And I think in part it was because I was an economic
                    officer in a political bureau. There were many opportunities; all through my
                    career I just happened to be where the action was. I thought often of the
                    Chinese curse “may you live in interesting times”. Within two weeks after I
                    joined the Department, I was on a delegation which at the time was the one of
                    the few things that was going on with the Soviet Union, which was the Lend-Lease
                    negotiations. I found myself in financial negotiations, which provided a lot of
                    good experience; a lot of frustration but good experience in aid programs, first
                    in Yugoslavia, then with Poland, with provided opportunities for economic
                    analysis, and again with negotiations. A lot of experience with legislation and
                    dealing with the Congress, which again involved fascinating experiences but also
                    were good learning experiences. So I was very fortunate. It was one of the
                    reasons I found it difficult to tear myself away. I greatly enjoyed what I was
                    doing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Talking about Congress, were there any either incidents or

                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes, especially Wilbur Mills. He was Chairman of the House Committee on
                    Ways and Means. He was an absolutely fascinating figure, and I spent a lot of
                    time with him. He kind of adopted me. I also spent a lot of time with Senator
                    Long and was one of the few people in the State Department who could get along
                    with him. He used to say to me “Julius, you are a statesman, but you are wrong.”
                    Senator Long was not known as an internationalist. Most of this took place in
                    the '60s and '70s.</p>

                        the State Department who either served as mentors or bete noires, or just
                        characters, that you can think of?</hi>

                    boss, George Truesdell , who was the Officer in Charge of Economic Affairs in
                    the Office of Eastern European Affairs. What I gained from him - I think there
                    were a lot of character building lessons that I learned from him. He was a very
                    straitlaced person, and a lot of that stuck with me. People like Harold Vedeler,
                    who was in the office for a long time, and ultimately became Office Director and
                    who taught me a lot.</p>

                    People like Freddy Reinhardt, who was a Director was someone I admired. Of
                    course I had, not close relationships, but brushes with people like Chip Bohlen,
                    and Tommy Thompson, legendary figures in Soviet Affairs. George Kennan also, but
                    that comes in the next decade, during your tenure in Yugoslavia.</p>

                        people” and try to explain sort of the cultural reason why you are getting
                        this? Were you finding frustration? Sometimes this happens.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: I don't recall anything quite like that. Of course, I was a little feisty
                    and there were some steadying hands. I recall the first draft I did of a
                    document, which was a diplomatic note, and a fellow in the office named Clarence
                    Nichols, who said, “Well, this is a pretty good job, but what I would do is take
                    this paragraph and move it here and this paragraph and move it here, and take
                    out these words...” and in the end, what I had written was barely recognizable,
                    but he said, “Well, this is really a very good job.” So I learned a lot about
                    drafting in those days. But I don't recall anything quite like what you
                    suggest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else during the '50s that you can think
                        about that I may have missed? How about Treasury? As far as you were
                        concerned, was Treasury much of a player at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>KATZ: Not so much in the '50s. They did play some role with respect to the
                    Yugoslav aid program, but the important interagency relationships were with the
                    Departments of Agriculture on PL 480, with Commerce on export controls, and with
                    the Defense Department, particularly on the getting the Lend Lease ships back
                    from the Soviets. Of course there was the aid organization, known as the
                    Economic Cooperation Agency, the ECA which until 1962 was independent of the
                    State Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Commerce? Was Commerce a problem or not? I came
                        in the Foreign Service in '55, and Commerce was considered to be a rather
                        stodgy, not terribly competent outfit.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Commerce has had a very much up and down history, but our primary
                    involvement in those days was on export controls, and there they had people who
                    were certainly technically competent. The government was really quite different
                    in those days. It was smaller, obviously, but the White House didn't play that
                    much of a role in the way it does now. The White House was a smaller
                    organization, the NSC was not as large; you didn't have the economic
                    coordination to the same extent as today or in after the 1970's.</p>
                <p>There was the Psychology Strategy Board (or something like that) in the
                    Eisenhower Administration, which was in the Executive Office. It was, however,
                    what the name implied, a kind of propaganda operation. And while it did touch on
                    some of my work, it was eminently forgettable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll move to the '60s. In the first place, did you feel
                        any change when the Kennedy administration came in, about the thrust of
                        things? Did you still have the same sort of responsibilities then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes, I took over the Polish and Yugoslav aid programs in '59, and then the
                    Kennedy Administration took office in 1961. That was a rather exciting time,
                    because there was a kind of new air, a new vitality, and new young president.
                    The '50s of course had been a period of consolidation in many ways. Kennedy was
                    just a very exciting figure, and had made some speeches about Eastern Europe,
                    and what was going to happen in respect to our policy toward the region. In
                    fact, he gave a speech in Buffalo to a Polish community (it was said that there
                    were more Poles in Buffalo than there were in Warsaw).</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>There's one little interesting anecdote, I would recall. At the end of the
                    Eisenhower administration, we had committed ourselves to grant an Export-Import
                    Bank loan to Poland, and it required a Presidential Determination under the law,
                    because Poland was a communist country. I tried to move this piece of paper to
                    the President, and it kept getting delayed because of the claims settlement and
                    other issues. It came down to the last few weeks, and I was just having trouble
                    getting clearances on this document. It finally came down to the last week, and
                    it looked pretty hopeless. The Administration was going out of office, but I was
                    just determined to get this Determination done, and clear the deck, because it
                    really was a commitment of the Eisenhower administration and I thought that to
                    have to start this all over again with the new Administration it would be weeks
                    and months of further delay. I kept persisting, and then finally I got my last
                    clearance from the Defense Department, as it turned out, on January 19th. And so
                    I had to get it to the Bureau of the Budget and get them to finally chop on it,
                    get it to the Secretary of State, and then forward it to the White House. And
                    everybody kept saying “you're crazy, no one is going to do this on the last day
                    of the Administration.”</p>
                <p>It turns out, you may remember, that we had a monumental snow storm that day, and
                    at about sometime around midday I grabbed someone in the office and I said,”We
                    just got this paper back from the Defense Department. Come with me.” I got
                    Charlie Eulis, who worked for me, and I said, “Look, I”m going to get my car out
                    of the garage, and I”m going to drive by the Old Executive Office Building. You
                    run in and get the chop on this paper and I'll wait for you.” Well, I got about
                    half a block from the State Department, and traffic was just blocked every which
                    way. He said “I'll start out on foot, and you catch up with me.” There was no
                    way I could get there, and so consequently I managed to get the car out of the
                    snow drift and back into the basement of the State Department building. Several
                    hours later old Charlie Eulis turns up with icicles on his face, but with the
                    document. And I sent it up to the Secretary's office, not knowing what he was
                    going to do with it, but thinking, “Well, I've done all I can.”</p>
                <p>At about six o'clock that evening I got a call from the Secretary's office,
                    Secretary Herter, asking me to come up there. “And what is this all about?” He
                    said, “Are you serious?” I said, “Yes sir. It was a commitment we had made and
                    was linked to these other agreements we had concluded, and I thought we had an
                    obligation to see it through.” And he said “Well, the President will have a
                    final signing period at ll o”clock tomorrow morning on the 20th, and I'll send
                    it over there. But I'm going to pen a note on it to condition the determination
                    on review by the incoming Administration.” I said “Thank you sir. I think that
                    is entirely reasonable.” At ll:30 the next morning I got a telephone call saying
                    “Congratulations, the President signed the Determination.”</p>
                <p>That may well have been the last official document that President Eisenhower
                    signed. And what happened subsequently is that before it could really be
                    reviewed or approved by President Kennedy, the Bay of Pigs invasion occurred,
                    the Poles denounced the Americans, and the loan never went through. It was all
                    in vain, but anyway, I gave it my best shot.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes, well, it became more active, because the interest in Eastern Europe,
                    but the Bay of Pigs invasion was kind of an upsetting event and slowed things
                    down.</p>

                </p>
                <p>KATZ: And then the other thing that began to happen was of course George Kennan
                    went to Yugoslavia as Ambassador, and that was a rather exciting experience for
                    me. First of all getting to work with George Kennan, but the reason I began to
                    work with him very closely was that in 1962 the Congress passed the Trade
                    Expansion Act, which gave rise to the Kennedy Round of trade negotiations. But
                    there was a provision in there requiring the withdrawal of most favored
                    treatment from Poland and Yugoslavia as soon as practicable. That was in part
                    because Wilbur Mills, for some reason that I never really learned, thought that
                    we had restored most favored nation treatment to Poland in 1959 in violation of
                    the law.</p>
                <p>The law quite clearly said that it required denial of most favored nation
                    treatment from countries controlled or dominated by the country or organization
                    controlling the world communist movement. We made a determination that Poland
                    was not controlled. Wilbur Mills, for some reason, got it into his head that was
                    something we shouldn't have done, although we had consulted with him, and
                    informed him that we were going to do that. Then began a period of some duration
                    where we were under a mandate to withdraw as soon as was practicable, but we did
                    not find it practical, and George Kennan became very much involved in this and
                    came back home frequently to lobby against this. At that time I didn't know
                    Wilbur Mills at all. I had met him, but certainly did not know him well. Kennan,
                    of course, was terribly upset by this, he treated it as a personal affront.</p>
                <p>Ultimately we got the provision of law reversed. We never did withdraw the MFN
                    treatment. But at the same time, Tito resumed some kind of relationship with the
                    Russians, and that led to a major review of our Yugoslav policy. Kennan was
                    sometimes on one side and sometimes on another with respect to what Tito was up
                    to. Tito, I believe, went to Moscow in 1963, I believe, and Kennan was greatly
                    offended that Tito did not confide in him on the content of his discussions in
                    Moscow. I became very much involved in this policy review and there was a brief
                    period — I can't remember exactly how long it lasted — when I was serving as
                    Yugoslav Desk Officer, as well as doing the economic job. And as I said, I had a
                    lot of contact with Kennan in that period.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Kennan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Well, I thought he was a fascinating person. He was incredibly articulate.
                    But I thought he was also very emotional, and he could impress not only others
                    with his writing, but himself. He would sometimes get an idea and build on it,
                    and it would become larger than life. I thought his analysis was sometimes
                    clouded by emotion and sometimes it was personal, for example his tendency to
                    regard disagreements as personal affronts. Overall, I think he was a person of
                    great insights and certainly a great historical perspective.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was again, off to one side, I was one what everyone
                        called a country team, but as chief of the consular section at the time, and
                        the way I was getting from my friends who were sort of in the political and
                        economic sections was really what you were saying, that this was some raw
                        meat that had to be tossed to the conservatives in Congress and it wasn't
                        going anywhere because a notice would be given and nothing would happen. I
                        didn't know the technicalities, but basically this was almost a non issue
                        but in order to get the greater good, and that Kennan was talking about, it
                        seemed as though he was advocating that Kennedy should get on a train, and a
                        la Wilson go and speak around the country on this issue, and it was taken
                        very personally by Kennan. One of the things that struck me, and struck
                        others, was that Kennan didn't really understand the American political
                        process. It always made me feel that he was probably a great historian, and
                        maybe not a very good ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: I think there's a lot to that. This issue with Wilbur Mills was a very
                    peculiar one, because I don't think there was whole lot of support for his
                    position. It was something that Mills himself didn't understand. There must have
                    been some stimulus, but I don't know what that was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Mills did come from Ohio, didn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: No. He came from Arkansas.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh that right; so he wouldn't have been up against the
                        immigrant pressures.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>KATZ: No, but that could have happened. But it wasn't just Yugoslavia, it was
                    Yugoslavia and Poland. It was a strange thing. And when Kennan came back,
                    clearly it wasn't going to change unless Wilbur Mills was persuaded. It was not
                    a matter of getting great support. Kennedy, of course, signed the Trade
                    Expansion Act because it was so overwhelmingly important and this was a
                    relatively small provision, and the notion was, well, this would get changed. We
                    would have to get this amended, and ultimately we did. I don't really remember
                    how that came about, but ultimately we did get an amendment, and it just went
                    through, and it wasn't any problem.</p>
                <p>Another example, of Kennan's thinking process was the incident I mentioned of
                    Tito's trip to Moscow in 1963, I think it was. I remember a series of messages
                    from Kennan saying first, that we really had nothing to worry about. Tito
                    certainly would not betray us by some new agreement with the Russians. And then
                    Tito returned and Kennan wrote “Well, I haven't heard from Tito, but I'm still
                    pretty confident that nothing happened.” Then the next day a message came in
                    saying.”Well I still haven't heard from Tito, and I wonder what he's up to, I
                    wonder what he did there.” And then after another message or two he said, “Well,
                    obviously Tito was up to no good. He must have stabbed us in the back.” And all
                    of these conflicting arguments were written with passion and persuasion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did anything happen with Poland during this Kennedy
                        period, because Kennedy was even closer to Poland in a way, he was much more
                        attuned, you might say, to them, being a Democrat, but also his politics,
                        and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Well, not a whole lot happened in '61. The President, of course took office
                    in '61. Much of the focus was on this Yugoslav problem. I don't recall anything
                    particularly startling with Poland, except there were some rough spots,
                    particularly coming out of the Bay of Pigs and harsh, condemnatory rhetoric from
                    Poland. There were a number of points in Kennedy's Buffalo speech, which
                    promised actions. although I have to confess I don't remember the particulars.
                    But I do recall a conversation sometime in '62, probably around October of '62,
                    it was kind of leading up to the congressional elections, and I got a call from
                    Mike Feldman, who was then Counselor to President Kennedy at the White House,
                    recalling the speech. It had in it something like a 7 point program. Kennedy was
                    fond of in his speeches of having six points, seven points, nine points. Feldman
                    said, “I'd like to review what's happened, and what have we accomplished with
                    respect to this Eastern European speech.” And I recall making a rather sour
                    response. I said, “Well, in fact, we've done almost nothing.” “Why is that?” he
                    said. I then went down point by point, indicating where we had been frustrated
                    by lack of Administration follow through. I do not think he was very happy with
                    me. What had happened was that there were other preoccupations and other
                    complications and so that the relationship with Eastern Europe didn't develop
                    quite as had been forecast in the speech. And as I say, our relations with
                    Poland had also soured a bit.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, it was the Berlin Wall period too. And it was
                        the whole Berlin situation, where we were; I mean Khrushchev was really
                        testing out; I mean he'd found Kennedy to be; he assumed Kennedy to be very
                        weak and was pushing him and so this turned things into much more of a
                        military “us and them” as opposed to a time of opening up and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: And there was no great rush of support from Eastern European countries to
                    the U.S. at that point, so there was certainly a cooling of relationships. There
                    was nothing really going on with Hungary or Poland, that I can recall in that
                    period of time. In fact, I then began to think that it was time to do something
                    else, that I had really been in Eastern European Affairs much longer than I had
                    intended. I'd been there 13 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a long time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: So what I had arranged to do was to go to the Senior Seminar, as a way of
                    disengaging for a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the State Department equivalent to War College. I
                        had a year of it; a very good year.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Well, I found that very appealing, the year off, but also the experience,
                    particularly since the Senior Seminar spent a lot of time on the domestic
                    economy and domestic political and social events, which I had become pretty
                    ignorant of. I knew a lot more about Eastern Europe than I did about the middle
                    of the United States. So I was scheduled to go into the Senior Seminar in 1963,
                    and some weeks before my departure, I got a call from George Springsteen, who
                    was a Special Assistant to Under Secretary George Ball saying “Mr. Ball would
                    like you to go to the Economic Bureau and become Deputy Director of the Office
                    of International Trade.” And I said, “Well, I really am looking forward to this
                    experience of the Senior Seminar.” He said, “Well, we can't really afford that;
                    we have to have you move over.”</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>I later learned that one of the reasons this came about was that the request had
                    really come from the Economic Bureau, and particularly from Phil Trezise, who
                    was the Deputy Assistant Secretary at the time. I had an experience with him in
                    Secretary Rusk's office. There was an export license application to permit the
                    export of technology on locomotives that were being sold by a British company to
                    Czechoslovakia. And the Commerce Department, or the interagency group ruled that
                    we couldn't let locomotives go the Czechoslovakia. Since we controlled the
                    technology, we could prevent the sale. And so the issue finally got escalated up
                    to the Secretary's office and we met with Secretary Rusk. He was clearly not
                    very enthusiastic about making this decision. And he grumbled, “Well, I don't
                    see why we should do anything for the Czechs.” And I said, “Well, Mr. Secretary,
                    I don't think we're doing it for the Czechs, I think first of all, there is a
                    sale by the U.S., a benefit to the U.S., and then of course it's the British who
                    are actually going to sell the equipment.” “Well, I don't see why we should do
                    anything for the British either.”</p>
                <p>Phil told me later that he thought that, “When you stood up to the Secretary that
                    way, I thought we had to get you into the Bureau.” I didn't know that was the
                    reason at the time, but, anyway, with Under Secretary Ball making this request,
                    I thought I couldn't turn it down, so I took a month off, and reported to the
                    Economic Bureau, and became Deputy Director of the Office of International
                    Trade.</p>
                <p>You had asked earlier who were my mentors and Phil Trezise was certainly one of
                    them. He taught me a lot about the policy process, particularly the interagency
                    process, how to manage it. Phil also helped shape my philosophy toward free
                    trade and minimal government regulation, long before it became politically
                    correct.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the head of the Economic Bureau at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: The Assistant Secretary was Griffith Johnson, Phil Trezise was the Senior
                    Deputy. Michael Blumenthal was another Deputy, although he was about to leave
                    there to become the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, or Deputy Special Trade
                    Representative, as it was known at the time. Christian Herter had become the
                    Special Trade Representative or STR, and Blumenthal became one of his deputies,
                    and went to Geneva. Blumenthal was to go to become the CEO of the Bendix
                    Corporation, Treasury Secretary in the Carter Administration and CEO of the
                    Unisys company.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>The reason they asked me to come over to the E Bureau was that the Kennedy Round
                    was about to start at that time. It was a big multilateral trade negotiation. I
                    had some prior contact with Mike Blumenthal on the Polish issue. And of course,
                    over the years through the '50s and early '60s, I'd had contact with the
                    Economic Bureau on specific trade issues. There were export control issues,
                    anti-dumping cases, and some of the financial claims issues on which I had
                    worked with the Trade Office and the Office of Monetary Affairs. There were
                    other trade issues such as the most favored nation treatment issue, which
                    involved a lot of contact with the E Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel about relative power of the European
                        Bureau and Economic Bureau? The European Bureau being the most significant
                        bureau, I suppose, in the geographic sense, particularly at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Well, EUR was always a very strong bureau. The Economic Bureau, was equally
                    strong in personnel. In the nature of things, economics in the State Department
                    always took second place to the geographic bureaus. My own relations with the E
                    Bureau were cooperative and we were mutually supporting. After I came into the
                    Economic Bureau there were issues on trade where they put us at cross-purposes
                    with EUR, particularly on things involving the European Common Market, and
                    especially as we got into the Kennedy Round negotiations, there were a number of
                    conflicts. As the years wore on, I found that I had a lot more contact with
                    other Cabinet Officers than I did with the Secretary of State, and of course
                    that was a source of power, which I could play back in the Department. But EUR
                    always remained a very strong bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll stop at this point, and then I'd like to ask what
                        your specific responsibilities were at the Office of International Trade,
                        and also to explain the background about the Kennedy Round Negotiations. You
                        had mentioned that there were problems with the European Community
                        negotiations. We'll talk about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>* * * * Today is June 2, 1995. You wanted to talk about the background of the
                    Kennedy Round.</p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes. At the time, one of the major economic issues was economic integration
                    in Europe and the advent of the European Common Market among the six original
                    countries in Europe. This raised serous questions about the impact on other
                    countries in Western Europe, particularly Britain, but also the Scandinavians,
                    Austria and Switzerland that had organized themselves into the EFTA, the
                    European Free Trade Agreement.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>One of the main differences between the two groups had to do with agriculture.
                    Agriculture was the issue that was sometimes spoken of as the cement that held
                    the Common Market together, and the EFTA countries were not prepared to include
                    agriculture in their free trade arrangement. There were other issues as well.
                    The difference between a common market and a free trade area is that in a common
                    market there are no barriers among the members and a harmonized common tariff
                    against the rest of the world. In the case of free trade area, each member
                    maintains their own tariff against the rest of the world, while tariff are
                    eliminated on trade within the area.</p>
                <p>A common market requires a greater surrender of sovereignty, since the interests
                    of individual members must be subordinated to the interests of the group. In the
                    case of the Europeans, the EFTA countries were unwilling to submit themselves to
                    the commercial, and especially the agricultural policies of the Common Market.
                    The problem with all of this was that the EFTA countries would face serious
                    discrimination in the Common Market. In the United States, as well there was
                    concern that the Common Market would result in discrimination against U.S.
                    goods.</p>
                <p>So one of the things that was going on was an attempt by the Brits to negotiate
                    their own entry into the Common Market, which was to fail in the first time
                    around. Another approach initiated by the U.S. was to arrange for a big
                    negotiation which would bring down the tariffs substantially by all countries,
                    not only those in Europe, but the other members of GATT as well. So, the Kennedy
                    administration went to the Congress with a fairly bold proposal to obtain
                    authority to reduce tariffs by 50 percent. And that was the beginning of the
                    Kennedy Round.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the division of Europe into the EFTA and the
                        Common Market. Which were the countries in each?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: The Common Market, of course, was France, Germany, the three Benelux
                    countries, and Italy. Those were the six. The EFTA countries were the seven; at
                    the time we spoke of the sixes and the sevens, that Europe at sixes and sevens.
                    The EFTA was made up of Britain, Norway, Denmark, Sweden, Austria, Finland and
                    Switzerland. Spain and Portugal were outside both groups, since they still had
                    fascist governments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the State Department and your office have any
                        influence as this Kennedy Round proposal came up? Where did this come
                        from?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>KATZ: Oh, it really came from the State Department. Now that actually preceded my
                    move over to the Office of Trade, but it was largely led by George Ball, who was
                    then Under Secretary for Economic Affairs. He later became The Under Secretary,
                    the position that subsequently became Deputy Secretary. The Office of Trade,
                    which incidentally was at the time the largest office in the State Department
                    and was strong in quality as well as in numbers. The Office and the Deputies in
                    the Bureau, Phil Trezise and Mike Blumenthal were importantly involved in the
                    legislation and the beginnings of the Kennedy Round negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you moved over to this Bureau, what did you and the
                        people you were working with see as the greatest stumbling blocks? Was it
                        going to be domestic or was it going to be particular countries, or
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: When I first came over, I was a bit of a novice, even though I moved in as
                    Deputy Director. I had come from a very different milieu. Eastern Europe, with
                    mostly bilateral relations was very different. And although I'd had some
                    involvement in trade policy issues, such as the MFN issues and anti-dumping
                    problems, a lot of what I had worked on were financial negotiations and aid
                    programs. So, as I say, I was the new boy on the block, but not with a whole lot
                    of experience in trade policy lore. I knew something about the laws, but the
                    operations and philosophy was somewhat new to me.</p>
                <p>What I became involved in initially was not so much the Kennedy Round as GATT
                    issues, that is, the other part of trade policy, not the big negotiation, but
                    normal GATT business. And I attended meetings of the Contracting Parties, which
                    was an annual meeting at which a whole lot of ordinary business of the GATT was
                    taken up. I also became involved in the negotiation of a new chapter of the
                    GATT, Chapter Four, which was intended to deal with the burgeoning demands of
                    developing countries to tilt the playing field in their favor. And that was a
                    big and very contentious issue.</p>
                <p>I also became involved after a while with the issue of non-tariff barriers in the
                    Kennedy Round negotiations, and that was the first time to any significant
                    degree, that there was focus on other than tariff barriers. The stuff of
                    previous negotiations was reducing tariffs. But the question of how do you deal
                    reciprocally with issues which are not quantifiable. The tariff negotiations
                    could always be reduced to a dollar volume, and you could at least argue that
                    you were reducing hundred of millions or billions of dollars worth of your trade
                    versus similar amounts by your trading partners. But in non-tariff barriers, you
                    were dealing with issues which were non-quantifiable for the most part. Also,
                    they were much more difficult because they were rooted in laws and sometimes
                    ancient practices with strongly entrenched private interests. So that was a
                    novel issue in trade policy, and in fact it was handled in a rather clumsy way,
                    through the negotiation.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>In the end when we completed the negotiations and arrived at an agreement, there
                    were some issues that were not able to get through the Congress. Traditionally
                    in these negotiations the Congress provided a prior grant of authority to the
                    President. The President was authorized to reduce tariffs by X percent, in this
                    case, 50 percent, with some guidelines having to do sometimes with sensitive
                    areas. But he was then able to enter into agreements to bring about that result
                    and to proclaim the results thereof - in other words, he had authority to
                    negotiate and then actually execute the agreement. In the case of non-tariff
                    barriers, there was no prior grant of authority. So we had to go back to the
                    Congress, and in two instances, the Congress said no. And here we were having
                    reached an agreement, and we had to go back and, in effect, renegotiate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: One was anti-dumping, which has been an extremely difficult issue to this
                    very day. In fact it has gotten worse and worse. And the other issue was a
                    quaint practice known as wine gallon assessment. We assessed duty and taxes on
                    whisky not by alcoholic content, but by volume, so that it was cheaper to bring
                    in alcohol in bulk at 200 proof, and then cut it with New Jersey swamp water.
                    The British, in particular, claimed discrimination. What was happening was
                    Scotch Whiskey was being brought over and being bottled in New Jersey instead of
                    in Scotland with water that was supposed to be processed through the heather and
                    the peat, and all that.</p>
                <p>We agreed to change it, and went back to the Congress and there was a Congressman
                    Watt from Kentucky, who said he had only three interests in life: horses, women,
                    and whiskey. And he said no. He was a senior member of the Ways and Means
                    Committee, so that got scuttled.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that taken care of at some later date?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: It was taken care of in a subsequent negotiation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After Mr. Watt passed to his reward? Sounds pretty good to
                        me. Were we coming up against the Japanese and that whole thing that we are
                        still wrestling with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: No, the big problem in the negotiations, the really contentious issues were
                    with Europe, then as now. Well, there were two big issues. The biggest issue was
                    agriculture. The European Community was just beginning their common agricultural
                    policy, the CAP, and as I say, some argued, particularly the French, that
                    agriculture was the cement that held the community together. But they were
                    beginning to turn very protectionist, and using more and more subsidies.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>One of the most intractable issues was that of the variable levy. The way the
                    variable levy worked was to establish a domestic reference price and then the
                    import duty would equate the difference between the world price and their
                    internal price. In effect, it resulted in infinite protection. And then to make
                    matters worse they took the proceeds from their import taxes and used those to
                    subsidize exports. The variable levy was an infernal machine, as far as we were
                    concerned. That was a very big issue.</p>
                <p>The other issue which delayed the start of the negotiations for almost three
                    years was the negotiating plan. We proposed, that contrary to previous
                    negotiations, we didn't think it was efficient to negotiate item by item. Rather
                    we proposed to use what we called linear cuts, that is 50 percent cuts in
                    tariffs across the board, some with exceptions. The Europeans, on the other hand
                    advocated something they called ecretement, which involved larger cuts for
                    higher duties. They argued out that the profile of their tariff was rather flat
                    whereas our's had peaks and valleys. So they wanted to knock off those peaks.
                    And that issue detained us, as I said, for almost three years.</p>
                <p>Interestingly, that was again an issue in the Uruguay Round negotiations as was
                    the question of linear cuts versus item by item, except that the roles became
                    reversed and the U.S. was insisting on item by item negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was our tariff profile different?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Oh, it was that way for historical reasons. Of course, we started out in
                    1930 with the Smoot-Hawley Tariffs, so we had an extremely high tariff, and then
                    we began to cut it through reciprocal trade negotiations, but the tough items
                    always stayed high. So, for example, things like textiles and shoes, and
                    so-called sensitive import items just stayed at very high levels.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A sensitive import item is...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: One that is politically sensitive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Rather than militarily, or something else.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>KATZ: Well, there are also security items. I mean, we always argued, for example,
                    that oil was a security item, particularly after 1959 when we introduced the oil
                    import program. But it really came down to political sensitivity. For a long
                    time we wouldn't cut the duty on brooms made of broom corn, because allegedly
                    they were produced by blind people. It turns out there were a couple hundred
                    blind people producing these; maybe 2,500 workers in the whole country and we
                    wouldn't cut the duty on brooms made of broom corn, even after we no longer
                    produced broom corn and had to import it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In this time, during the Kennedy Round, did the various
                        delegations see tariffs as a money raising thing, as opposed to a
                        protectionist type of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Some countries had that problem, but generally tariffs were not considered
                    a good way of raising a lot of money. It's not generally source of government
                    revenue, although interestingly, that has now become a problem for the U.S.
                    because of our budget law, the so-called pay as you go requirement. Now when we
                    reduce duties and lose revenue, we have to make it up some other way. Reducing
                    tariffs actually increases revenue, because of the growth stimulus. But under
                    the law the revenue effect is measured statically, rather than dynamically.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For this Kennedy Round when you were involved in it was
                        from when to when about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Well, the Trade Expansion Act was 1962, the negotiations started in '63,
                    which is about the time that I came into it. And they went until 1968. There was
                    and is an invariable rule of international trade negotiations, and that is they
                    expand to fill the time made available by the U.S. Congress. We had a five year
                    negotiating authority, which ended in June 1968. So that was the absolute
                    deadline for the negotiations. Without the U.S. there wasn't going to be a
                    negotiation, we were the driving force.</p>
                <p>There is one other issue that I should mention in this connection, which also
                    delayed the negotiations in time. And that is we had a furious battle with the
                    Europeans over something that came to be called the Chicken War. And that came
                    about because of the common agricultural policy. We had a very large market for
                    frozen chicken in Europe, because we began after World War II producing chickens
                    in factories, as you know, with assembly line technique; feed them, slaughter
                    them, cut them up, and freeze them and export them. But by the '60s this
                    technology began to be exported along with the feed. We also had a very large
                    market for feed. And Europe, using their variable levy, taxed the imports, in
                    effect cut off the imports, but then began to export them with export subsidies.
                    We ultimately brought a case against the Europeans in the GATT, under dispute
                    settlement. I guess we threatened to bring the case, but ultimately what
                    happened was the Executive Secretary, as he was then known, Wyndham White,
                    brought the parties together and had a panel examine the issue and render a
                    judgement. Q: This was the Executive Secretary of the GATT?</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>KATZ: Yes. He was a legendary character. He was a Third Secretary in the British
                    Foreign Service on leave to the GATT. He never advanced beyond that grade since
                    he never went back to the British Foreign Service, but as I say, he became a
                    legendary character. He was in the GATT from 1946 to 1970 or so. But anyway, he
                    persuaded the parties to, in effect, arbitrate the issue, or at least arbitrate
                    the amount of damage. We argued that our tariff concession on chickens had been
                    impaired by the European practice. That was upheld, and then there was the
                    question of what was the amount of compensation that we were due. It was finally
                    determined to be $28 million, but instead of negotiating compensation, we raised
                    duties on European products, and that included, importantly, trucks, French
                    brandy, Dutch cornstarch, and some other items. The interesting item was trucks.
                    We raised the duty to 25 percent, and we did that because Volkswagen was
                    beginning to send their panel trucks into the U.S. in some quantity, and we
                    thought well, here is a way to really put some hurt on the Germans.</p>
                <p>What happened subsequently is that since they couldn't come in as trucks, they
                    came in as passenger vans, and the seats would be unbolted, shipped back to
                    Germany, and then the next batch of passenger vans would come in, and they would
                    end up being trucks. But that then gave rise to the idea of the van. Why not
                    leave the seats in there, it's not a bad idea, which is the origin of the
                    mini-van. An example of a distorting effect of trade policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I wonder if you could characterize from your experience,
                        as we are talking of this time in the mid '60s, of the negotiating and the
                        outlook of some of the various countries, including the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: As I say, we were largely driven by the notion that it was desirable to
                    bring down protection, bring down duties. The word free trade really hadn't
                    permeated the lexicon and in fact it was a somewhat politically incorrect term
                    with some people in the Congress and was avoided. But there were a lot of people
                    that believed that free trade was the ultimate ideal. What we had to do was
                    continually work at bringing down duties. Other countries said, well, that was
                    OK for their trading partners to bring down duties, but they had domestic
                    interests. The Canadians were somewhat ambivalent about this. The Canadians sort
                    of believed in free trade but were very concerned that they would leave
                    themselves open particularly to the U.S. and this would interfere with their
                    development objectives. Europe of course was concerned with building the Common
                    Market and everybody had the problem with domestic interests that wanted to
                    maintain protection.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>The other issue which was looming larger and larger was the issue of the
                    developing world. In the midst of this negotiation, 1965 to be exact, there came
                    the first UNCTAD conference. UNCTAD stood for the United Nations Conference on
                    Trade and Development. That produced a big battle within the U.S. government,
                    particularly within the State Department, on how to handle this. The
                    traditionalists argued that we couldn't or shouldn't breach basic principles
                    such as our most-favored nation policy. What the developing countries were
                    really seeking was discrimination in their favor, a kind of affirmative action
                    program. So the notion of trade preferences, that is, that you reduce tariffs
                    for the benefit of developing countries, was gaining more and more currency. The
                    Europeans had endorsed it, and a number of other countries had endorsed it. The
                    U.S. was the outlier.</p>
                <p>There were also questions of commodity prices, which loomed large. That was not a
                    new issue, but developing countries argued that the terms of trade were
                    constantly going against them, therefore, what we needed were more and more
                    international commodity agreements to raise prices. This ultimately led to a big
                    battle in the State Department, and led to a change, particularly when President
                    Johnson came in, to a change in leadership of the Economic Bureau. Griff Johnson
                    departed, and Tony Solomon came in as Assistant Secretary at that time. Griff
                    Johnson had actually gone to the UNCTAD meeting, but in the midst of it someone
                    else replaced him as head of delegation, and I can't now remember who that
                    was.</p>
                <p>There's one other major issue that I should talk about, and that is an issue with
                    Canada. The Canadians had this somewhat contradictory policy of being basically
                    supportive of free trade, but were concerned about whether this would permit
                    them to gain sufficient investment to build their own industries. And this came
                    to a head in the case of automobiles. Their efforts to encourage investment were
                    not working very well. The situation was that Canadian consumers, living astride
                    the U.S. border, wanted the same kind of cars as U.S. consumers. And so their
                    purchases were increasing, notwithstanding a rather substantial price
                    difference, which was a result of Canadian tariff policy. The Canadians then
                    introduced a so-called import for export scheme. They had developed what was
                    then considered to be a large trade deficit in automobiles, about $600 to $700
                    million and they proposed to correct this through this import for export scheme.
                    Basically, a vehicle manufacturer could import duty free a dollar's worth of
                    goods for every dollar worth of exports out of Canada. And what this was
                    designed to do was to skew the trade more in Canada's favor.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>This came at a point where there were also some things happening in the U.S.
                    industry. Right about this time Studebaker decided to go out of the automobile
                    business, but they did it by announcing they were moving their production to
                    Canada. In fact, what they were doing was phasing it out. They were going to
                    continue in Canada for a while, but they closed their plant in South Bend. And
                    this caused a big ruckus. A parts manufacturer of mufflers then brought a
                    subsidy complaint against Canada because of this duty remission scheme. And that
                    produced absolute hysteria in Canada at the thought that we would countervail
                    against imports from Canada. Douglas Dillon, who was Treasury Secretary, was
                    just about to issue a countervailing duty order, when Phil Trezise came up with
                    a brilliant idea.</p>
                <p>Phil noted that what we had was a single industry sitting as astride the border,
                    with the Canadian plants in Windsor Canada is actually south of Detroit. The
                    industry produced the same kind of vehicles, on both sides of the border, except
                    that the production in Canada was inefficient as compared to the U.S., because
                    the Canadian production runs were so small. For example, in the case of Ford,
                    they produced 90 different models in Canada to meet consumer demand there. They
                    would literally have to stop the assembly line to change from model to model.
                    Wouldn't it be better, Phil suggested if there were an integrated industry
                    across the border?</p>
                <p>That led to the U.S.-Canada Auto Agreement. Basically, it was negotiated by four
                    people. It was Phil Trezise and myself from the State Department, and two people
                    from the Department of Commerce, Bob McNeill and Ted Smith. We negotiated this
                    agreement over the course of about seven months, and it was a fairly dramatic
                    event in U.S.-Canadian economic relations. There had been several attempts over
                    the years to have free trade, going back to the 19th century. There was a
                    so-called reciprocal trade agreement, which was abrogated at the time of the
                    Civil War. There was a free-trade agreement that was negotiated in the late 19th
                    century, but it was defeated in Canada after the Speaker of the House, Champ
                    Clark, said that “with the approval of this treaty the Stars and Stripes will
                    soon be flying over the Parliament Building in Ottawa.” That didn't sit very
                    well in Canada. There was a secret effort after World War II which came to
                    naught, and never got to the stage of negotiations. So this was a pretty big
                    event, especially in Canada, and the agreement was signed on the banks of the
                    Perdinales (Texas) by President Johnson and Lester Pearson and the two
                    Secretaries of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can we talk a bit about this. One of the themes in these
                        interviews I've been doing is about negotiating with the Canadians. Most
                        foreign service officers who've done this, this and negotiating with the
                        Soviets are about on a par. Could you talk a bit about your experiences with
                        these negotiations?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>KATZ: I think it is worth commenting on. The thing about negotiating with the
                    Canadians is that, at least in those days, is that you have two parties that are
                    speaking the same language, I mean literally and figuratively. There are some
                    minor cultural differences, but for the most part the negotiations are between
                    people who think pretty much alike. Negotiations tend to be very direct and very
                    blunt. In this particular case, (the Auto negotiations) the Canadians had a team
                    consisting of four deputy ministers, including one who was very flamboyant,
                    Simon Reisman, and a dominant personality. Simon was a very smart, but volatile
                    person, so that frequently the negotiations were characterized by a large amount
                    of shouting, table thumping, profanity across the table.</p>
                <p>The session that really broke the back of the negotiations occurred in
                    Montebello, which was a resort half way between Montreal and Ottawa in November
                    of 1964. We were holed up there for three days and two nights. There was one
                    point in one almost all-night session, when there was a fair amount of
                    disagreement, not only across the table but within each of the delegations as
                    well. Tension was running high. Simon was misbehaving and then one of this
                    colleagues tried to bring him down off the ceiling. Simon turned on his
                    colleague and said, “who is running this f—ing negotiation?” That produced some
                    shock and then great laughter, which broke the tension.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the people on our delegation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: At that point we had others than the main gang of four. We had some lawyers
                    there, and I can remember Phil Trezise also of blowing up. He was angry at both
                    the Canadians and his American colleagues. I walked him back into a little ante
                    room to calm him down. So, negotiations with the Canadians can be pretty wild
                    swinging affairs. They are not quite as structured, or as diplomatic, as they
                    are with other countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds much more closer to union management
                        negotiations and automobile industry...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: That would be a fair comparison. In other negotiations I've been in people
                    get excited, but there is much more civility because they are foreigners. But
                    with the Canadians, there are many fewer inhibitions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Canadians pull the “Big You and Little Us”?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>KATZ: Frequently. There is the inferiority complex factor in our relations with
                    Canada. There's an old story about the Canadians that they are a nation that
                    suffers from two inferiority complexes: one with respect to the mother country
                    and the other to the neighbor to the south. (I sometimes said to my good
                    Canadian friends that the reason they had an inferiority complex is that they
                    really were inferior.) So there is that, and much of their argument was that
                    without some protection, everything will go south. That was something was had to
                    constantly deal with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As this with Phil Trezise and all this idea of doing this
                        industry wide negotiation; trans-border negotiation; was sort of the example
                        of the coal and steel community, which was really the guts of the European
                        Common Market.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: There is some parallel here. The Coal and Steel Community in Europe was
                    seen as a forerunner of European economic integration. The Auto Pact had a
                    somewhat similar impact, but it was not undertaken with the larger goal in mind.
                    The Auto Pact was intended at the outset to deal with a specific problem.</p>
                <p>It just didn't make sense to have economic barriers at the border in the auto
                    industry. But of course there was the Canadian sensitivity about absorption —
                    being the 51st State. So one had to be sensitive about this. The idea of free
                    trade, complete free trade as we have now, would not have washed at that point
                    in time. But still, here was a sectoral free trade agreement. Of course, the
                    biggest item of trade between the two countries was in the automobile sector.
                    Much more so now, it's about a third of our trade now - I don't remember what it
                    was then, but it was very important.</p>
                <p>The success of the Auto agreement did give rise to questions whether there might
                    be other sectors which might be appropriate for free trade. Simon Reisman, who
                    at the time was the Deputy Minister of Industry, was a key Canadian figure in
                    the negotiation because he had done an earlier study on the automobile industry
                    in Canada, trying to address its inefficiencies. The remission plan, this import
                    for export scheme, was a kind of integration scheme. What it did was to permit
                    the companies, the four major companies, to integrate their operations across
                    the border, although it was vulnerable to attack as a subsidy under our
                    countervailing law. Simon was sympathetic to the notion of integration through
                    free trade and had some notions that this idea could perhaps be extended to the
                    tire industry, and chemicals and other things. But a lot of that was very
                    private, and not an element of the negotiations. Q: Well, one almost has to look
                    at this type of thing incrementally, isn't that so? To get people used to these
                    things.</p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes, but that can cut two ways. There were times subsequently when the
                    people began to see Canada as more of a threat, particularly as the trade
                    balance shifted. And then for a while it was going up and down but after it
                    began to shift, when John Connolly came along, I think he had a somewhat
                    different view. In fact, well, we'll get to that later. But there was another
                    point of view.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With Canada, were there problems over cultural that got
                        into your orbit?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes, there was an issue and some of these issues continue today. There was
                    an issue then about advertising in Canadian publications. They didn't like the
                    idea of split editions of Time Magazine and the Readers' Digest. What they did
                    was to sell Canadian advertising in the Canadian runs of those publications.
                    They had been there for a long time, so they were somewhat grand fathered, but
                    the Canadians didn't like the idea of American publications running a Canadian
                    edition with Canadian advertising because this competed with MacLean's and other
                    Canadian publications. Canadians had a serious preoccupation with maintaining
                    their own cultural industries, although they have not been able to persuade
                    Americans that cultural industries were essentially different from other
                    industries.</p>
                <p>Clearly, the Canadian economy was a somewhat difficult thing to manage, because
                    Canada, although a vast country to the north, in terms of population. was a
                    country of about 100 miles deep and 3,000 miles wide. And the natural economic
                    forces flowed north and south, and not east and west. And to make them go east
                    and west, there were various subventions and policies to force economic
                    relations to go east and west. Their railroad system was designed to unify the
                    country at tremendous cost in subsidies, which they are now giving up; it's just
                    too expensive. So they are ending the subsidies, and they are privatizing what
                    is left of the railroads. But for more than a century they have maintained
                    transportation and other subsidies. That has given rise to many problems with
                    the U.S. This notion of maintaining an independent Canada is an everyday
                    preoccupation with many Canadians. Of course no country is fully independent
                    today, though no country will admit that.</p>
                <p>There are a lot of bad jokes about Canadian culture, which I won't go into now,
                    but we have believed that Canada's cultural policies amount to plain old
                    fashioned protectionism. In addition to the problem of periodicals. we have had
                    problems in broadcasting, and with acquisitions of Canadian book publishers by
                    U.S. companies, which were disallowed.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>There was also a banking problem, where CitiBank was denied the right to acquire
                    a Canadian bank, whereas a Dutch bank was permitted to do so. I used to say that
                    at any given time in our relations there was somewhere between half a dozen and
                    a dozen issues with Canada. None tremendously large in money terms, after the
                    auto issue, but very noisy disputes, particularly in Canada. Canadians, if not
                    dominated by, live in fear of domination by the U.S. They are in a sense
                    dominated by all of the noise that comes across the border, that generally flows
                    in one direction. In the U.S. on most days when you pick up the Washington Post
                    or New York Times, I daresay you won't see any stories about Canada. Pick up The
                    Globe and Mail, and there will be half a dozen stories about what's happening in
                    the United States. And that is a cause for sensitivity as well. The Canadians
                    feel they are taken for granted. It's occurred to me the other day that the U.S.
                    Canadian border has the longest one-way mirror in the world. It faces North.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time, I'm not sure if you were involved in
                        these types of negotiation: was Diefenbaker the Prime Minister then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: No, he had already departed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This did mean a change, then, because he was very much a
                        nationalist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: He was very nationalistic. And Lester Pearson was much more international.
                    But the other thing that began to affect the relationship, particularly after
                    '64, but it was not something I was directly involved in, but it was Vietnam.
                    Lyndon Johnson's resentment over Lester Pearson's less than enthusiastic support
                    for our policy was a sore point with LBJ. In fact, one of the reasons I guess,
                    that the Auto Agreement was signed on the banks of the Perdinales, was so that
                    Johnson could ream out Lester Pearson, which he did. In fact, some of this is
                    written about in the Doris Goodman book about Lyndon Johnson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, the other more contentious adversary/ally,
                        whatever you want to call it, was France, wasn't it. How did you see
                        American-French relations. What were your experiences with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Well, I didn't see a whole lot of it in this period, particularly in the
                    '60s. More of it in the '70s, and especially in the '90s. France, of course, was
                    one of the main problems in the Kennedy Round negotiations. I don't really
                    recall any other particular interest, but the problem of chickens, the problem
                    of agriculture generally and the ecretement issue were largely driven by the
                    French. So there was a lot of contention there, but not as great in the economic
                    area as it became later.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you as a negotiator have problems, knowing what
                        American practices were, to go out and protest almost the mirror practice on
                        the part of another country. I mean, we all have our areas of protectionism
                        and all this, and one know this. But you have to go out and make
                        protests.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Well, that's not really a problem, because that's what the negotiation is
                    about. You are trading widgets for gadgets, and you're trying to persuade the
                    other side to deal with the most difficult things for him and he's trying to
                    persuade you to do the same thing. Something that I never really liked to do,
                    but a lot of American negotiators always fell back on the Congress. They always
                    used the Congress as the bad cop. “Well, we'd love to help you fella, but you
                    know, we just couldn't persuade the Congress.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Take that weapon away and the whole State Department
                        collapses.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: As I say, I didn't like to use that as the argument, but I would say that
                    we just can't do it. This is the limit of our ability.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With other countries, were they not as having to look over
                        the shoulder as much as at their parliament?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: That's right. Our constitutional system made it somewhat difficult for us.
                    Other countries could enter into an agreement, and because of the parliamentary
                    system, that was it. But on the other hand, they still had their political
                    problems. So in that sense, I'm not sure the differences are all that great.
                    They had to deal with their industry groups or their sectoral interests, and we
                    did too. In fact in later negotiations our system changed so that there was much
                    greater participation by the private sector, not directly, but through an
                    elaborate advisory committee structure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did some of the countries, particularly Canada, France,
                        Britain, and all, know how to play Congress at the same time they were
                        negotiating with you. Did you have the feeling they were making their
                        contacts and working on Congress at the same time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>KATZ: I wouldn't say that was the case with respect to negotiations, particularly
                    not at the time of the Kennedy Round. Later on in terms of specific issues, they
                    became much more adept at dealing with the U.S. political system. And they do
                    now. In the old days, it was not considered appropriate for a foreign diplomat
                    to even deal with the Congress, or indeed, even go to another agency before
                    coming to the State Department. The situation now is very different. In fact,
                    most embassies in Washington of any importance have congressional officers. They
                    have people with specific responsibilities for the Congress, and of course they
                    have direct relationships with other agencies. The same is true of our agencies,
                    For example, the Secretary of Agriculture, if he is any good, knows all of his
                    important counterparts around the world. So with the Secretary of Commerce or
                    the USTR in terms of trade ministers, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, we're talking about the Kennedy Round, obviously
                        the Department of Commerce and I assume the Treasury played a role. I was
                        wondering, how you found their caliber and their outlook, and how we meshed
                        with them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Well, this is an important area. With the Trade Expansion Act of 1962,
                    there was an important organizational change in the government. The question of
                    who managed trade policy had been an issue in the government, and had shifted
                    from the State Department to the Commerce Department, and the argument was being
                    made that it ought to be shifted back to the State Department. Basically, the
                    Commerce Department was considered to be very industry oriented — narrowly
                    industry-oriented. And that wasn't satisfactory. And of course the State
                    Department was suspect for other reasons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Giving away the store?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>KATZ: Yes, giving away the store. And so in the 1962 act, the Chairman of the
                    Ways and Means Committee, Wilber Mills, came up with the idea of creating a
                    Special Trade Representative. The reason he gave, (I don't think he said this
                    publicly) was, “We have to do this because we don't trust the State Department,
                    and the Commerce Department is incompetent.” Well, both statements were
                    exaggerations. But I think it reflected this feeling that you couldn't trust
                    either departments. So the Office of the Special Trade Representative was
                    established within the White House. Governor Herter, who had just been Secretary
                    of State, was the first STR. It was initially, a very small organization of
                    about perhaps 20 or 30 people. Some of the personnel came from the State
                    Department, and some from the Commerce Department, and some from other agencies
                    as well. That is the model that has existed for 30 years now with some further
                    evolution, with the STR becoming the USTR, the United States Trade
                    Representative instead of the Special Trade Representative, with Cabinet status.
                    It has grown to about 160-odd people, with maybe another 50 detailees from other
                    agencies. But in any event, in those days that was the structure, and Governor
                    Herter was beginning to become ill, and wasn't as deeply engaged as William
                    Roth, who was the Deputy who basically ran STR. Joe Greenwald, who was the
                    Director and I as the Deputy Director of the Office of Trade, spent a lot of
                    time at STR. The delegations, the negotiating delegations, were basically made
                    up of a lot of State Department people and a lot of people from our office, as
                    well as others. There was an incoming class of Foreign Service officers, and a
                    group of 10 or 15 were detailed to a negotiating team in Geneva. In those days
                    the most of the negotiators were resident in Geneva. Two of the junior Foreign
                    Service officers that I remember in particular, are Winston Lord, and Ernest
                    Preeg, who were members of the delegation. Both went on to distinguished
                    careers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When this came about, this Special Trade Representative,
                        what was sort of the reaction from your point of view and your observation
                        of the State Department to this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: This happened before I actually got there; some months before I got there.
                    But the first question when I was asked to take this position was what was going
                    to happen to the Office of Trade with this new institution. The answer was we
                    would continue to play a major role, and indeed we did. But there was initial
                    anxiety. In fact, the other thing that happened was that one of the State
                    Department lawyers, who I had worked with very closely on some other matters,
                    John Rehm, particularly on aid matters and aid legislation, went over to become
                    General Counsel. He wrote the Executive Order and, being a good lawyer working
                    for his client, put a lot more functions in the STR than he thought he would
                    ever get away with. And much to his amazement, it all stuck. George Ball just
                    accepted it all. And that caused a lot of discontent in the Office of Trade. But
                    the truth of the matter is that the State Department and the Foreign Service
                    officers really dominated the STR.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a problem of where the Foreign Service, looked
                        at trade as a method to get other things done? In other words, you don't
                        want to mess too much because we've got North American defense problems,
                        NORAD and Canada, or with France, we want them to be good to us in Africa,
                        or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: I wouldn't say that was generally true. But you know the institution. The
                    Economic Bureau was pretty much focused on economic interests, not unmindful of
                    larger foreign policy interests. But we were in constant battle with geographic
                    bureaus, particularly the European Bureau. And in a sense, we were sort of
                    between a rock and a hard place, because we dealt with the domestic interests
                    and the other agencies, and then on the other side we had the geographic bureau
                    pulling us in the other direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the geographic bureaus after, as opposed to the
                        ....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Well, what they were concerned about were good relations with their
                    countries, you know, a certain amount of clientitis. Incidentally, this was not
                    a problem in our negotiations with Canada, for example. We had a fairly good
                    relationship with the Canadian desk. It was a bit of a problem in the Uruguay
                    Round, particularly as we argued about agricultural policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With all these negotiations, did the Soviet Union, were
                        they a player at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: No. They were non players. As for the other communist countries, Poland had
                    been a signatory of the GATT, but withdrew in 1949-50, as well as from all
                    international economic organizations. The Czechs did not withdraw from the GATT,
                    but we had severed our relationship with Czechoslovakia in the GATT in 1951 when
                    we had to withdraw most favored nation treatment. And of course, Castro came
                    along in the 1959-60 and we invoked a security exception and basically severed
                    our GATT relationship with Cuba. So the communist countries were just not
                    players in the '60s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now how much was this what we called the developing,
                        non-developing, even North-South relationships; the less well-off countries
                        to the well-off countries? Johnson made a big announcement, but how much was
                        this hyperbole, and how much were we really trying to do something to change
                        the flow?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>KATZ: As I say, there was a division within the State Department and the
                    government on this. Here again is the difference between the geographic bureaus
                    and the Economic Bureau. The Latin American Bureau, for example, was much more
                    sympathetic to the South. The African Bureau had just been born, and they were
                    not terribly effective. NEA, was basically out of it; that wasn't much of an
                    issue for them. And the Asian Bureau was not terribly active, but basically
                    sympathetic. So it was largely with the Latin American Bureau that we had this
                    problem. And of course a lot of the intellectual content of the developing
                    country agenda was really coming from Latin America and from an economist named
                    Raoul Prebisch, who had been the Executive Director of the Economic Commission
                    for Latin America. He was an Argentine who was persona non grata there and lived
                    in Chile. But he became sort of the intellectual father for a lot of these
                    ideas, like preferences, the terms of trade argument, and commodity
                    agreements.</p>
                <p>When the Kennedy Administration came they put forward the Alliance for Progress,
                    which was intended to promote economic development in Latin America and the
                    Caribbean. That is how we got into the International Coffee Agreement and
                    attempts at some other commodity agreements. But that didn't really so much
                    affect what the big boys were doing in the GATT. The GATT was pretty much free
                    of the LDC debate, but increasingly in the '60s, and especially in '63, '64, and
                    '65, this issue of developing countries became intense, culminating in the
                    UNCTAD meeting in 1965. A lot of the debate focused on the issue of tariff
                    preferences. Despite the support for preferences, there was a lot of resistance
                    to breaching the MFN principle. I was opposed to preferences. Notwithstanding
                    the fact that we ultimately adopted the generalized preference scheme, I never
                    much cared for the idea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say generalized preferences, what did this
                        mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: This is something that happened in the late '60s. This was something
                    negotiated by Joe Greenwald. He went to the UNCTAD meeting and began focusing
                    more and more on these north-south issues. But ultimately there was an agreement
                    reached in the OECD, and then brought into the GATT to create a so-called system
                    of generalized preferences, as opposed to special preferences, country by
                    country. And there were general rules of the road by which developed countries
                    would extend to developing countries tariff preferences. They had to be zero
                    duty, and not just duty reductions. They had to be available to all countries
                    that qualified as developing countries. They were not to be regarded as
                    permanent. They were to be debt digressive, that is, they were to be eliminated
                    over time. They were not to be an obstacle to reduction in MFN duties and
                    digressive in that sense that the margin of preference would decline as MFN
                    rates declined. We ultimately legislated that in 1968.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We talked about Canada at some length, but how about
                        Mexico? Did Mexico play much of a role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>KATZ: No, Mexico was not a member of GATT until 1986. There was great opposition
                    among the highly protected Mexican private sector to the idea of the GATT.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is there anything else we should discuss about this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes. In 1967, there was a reorganization in the Bureau. This was after Tony
                    Solomon had come in as Assistant Secretary. He'd come in '66, I guess, and by
                    1967 he had decided on a reorganization, which was to increase the number of
                    Deputy Assistant Secretaries from three to five and to reorganize some of the
                    offices within the Bureau. Joe Greenwald became a Deputy Assistant Secretary for
                    Trade, and I became the Director of the Office of International Trade. But then
                    in 1967, one of the Deputies, Ed Freed, moved over to the White House. And so, I
                    was asked to take over his job, which was Deputy for International Resources and
                    Food Policy. This position had responsibility for three main areas. One was
                    energy, the Office of Fuels and Energy; another was the Office of Agricultural
                    Policy; and the third was the Office of Metals and Minerals.</p>
                <p>Tony Solomon called me in and said “I want you to move over and take this job.”
                    And I said, “Gee, I don”t know anything about commodities.” The whole thing
                    seemed kind of grubby to me. And he said, “Look, let me tell you something. It's
                    like all other problems we deal with. They essentially involve politics and
                    economics. Once you get past the jargon, they are like every other problem we
                    deal with. But there is one difference. Everything else we do in the bureau
                    really involves following somebody else lead, or checking on somebody else. If
                    it's financial, it's really the Treasury that is out in front. And if it's
                    trade, now it's STR. And there are only two things that we do in the State
                    Department that we really control, one is aviation policy, because we do all the
                    aviation negotiations. And the other is commodity policy. Everybody thinks that
                    commodity policy is too technical, too detailed, too dirty for important people
                    to be involved in. But the issues are interesting and they are important.” I
                    said, “Well, O.K., what the hell.” I always went and did what I was told. So I
                    moved in there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Excuse me, but what was Tony Solomon's background?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>KATZ: He was an interesting man. He started out in the brokerage business. He
                    started out working for Bache after he got out of college. And then World War II
                    came. He ended up in Iran, and he was a financial advisor to the Shah. He then
                    came back after the war, and went to Harvard and got two masters degrees. And
                    then went into a business in Mexico, which he sold to General Foods for a lot of
                    money. People loosely said a million dollars, but a lot of money. After that he
                    became interested in public policy and he came in with the Kennedy
                    Administration as a Deputy Assistant Secretary in ARA, Latin American Affairs.
                    As I said he then came over to the Economic Bureau. In the Carter Administration
                    he was named Under Secretary for Monetary Affairs, a very important post. In
                    1980, he became President of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, another very
                    important job. So he had quite a distinguished career.</p>
                <p>In any case, I moved into the commodity area, and one of the first problems I
                    faced was coffee. We were a member of the International Coffee Agreement that
                    had been negotiated in 1962, for a five year term. In 1967 its extension had to
                    be renegotiated. That negotiation was basically handled by the Office Director,
                    George Jacobs, who was the Acting Deputy Assistant Secretary. So I became
                    temporarily the Acting Director of the Office of Commodities. while that
                    negotiation was going on and when he moved out, and I became the Deputy
                    Assistant Secretary. Coffee was a major part of my responsibilities initially,
                    and then I got into other commodity issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the issues in coffee?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: The International Coffee agreement was a kind of cartel that regulated the
                    world market for coffee. What distinguished it from illegal cartels was that the
                    membership was made up of both importing and exporting nations. This provided a
                    balance, which assured against abuse by producers. The objective of the
                    agreement was to stabilize prices at levels acceptable to both producers and
                    consumers, and this was done through the setting of annual export quotas, which
                    thus effectively regulated the supply on the world market. The importing
                    countries kept the exporters honest by agreeing not to import coffee unless it
                    was properly certified by the exporting country. So the annual battle was
                    deciding what was to be the size of the quota with the importing countries
                    wanting larger quotas and the exporting countries wanting smaller quotas, but
                    all wanting to cheat vis a vis their exporting colleagues. It took a lot more
                    time than it was probably worth in the end. It was central to the Alliance for
                    Progress, and our relations with Latin America, because so many of them were
                    coffee producers and coffee represented a high proportion of their total
                    exports.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get information about who was doing what? It
                        sounds almost like an espionage operation.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>KATZ: Well, some of it was, although we were not involved in that part of it. But
                    basically, it turned out to be an exceptionally useful education in multilateral
                    negotiations. There was a Secretariat in London, which collected information on
                    imports and exports and price data. Although the price data was actually
                    collected by a contractor in New York, for the benefit of the International
                    Coffee Organization. So we would have all the information available, and after
                    some analysis on the state of the market, and where it was going, and where it
                    was likely to go, we would express our views on the size of the quota for the
                    year ahead.</p>
                <p>I should note that we had the benefit of the U.S. Department of Agriculture,
                    which at the time was the foremost collector of production information in the
                    world. In fact, everybody in the world relied on USDA for production data.
                    Individual countries had their own production figures and exports, but they were
                    not considered as reliable as those of the USDA. We also had industry advisors
                    who were parties of interest, so we had to be somewhat careful and take what
                    they told us with a grain of salt, because they created pressure on us to keep
                    the quota large to keep prices down. The other side of it were the exporting
                    countries, who wanted prices high, and therefore argued for lower quotas.</p>
                <p>There were an interesting array of forces, because among the exporters there were
                    the Latin Americans and there were the Africans. Basically divided on types of
                    coffee. And in Latin America there were the Brazilians, the Colombians, and then
                    the Central Americans. So there were all these different forces coming together,
                    and everybody wanted big quotas for themselves, but small global quotas, prices
                    high but not so high they that they couldn't compete against other countries. It
                    was a complex negotiation that took place on an annual basis, and then from time
                    to time there were crises because the price would plummet for some reason and
                    then we'd be called back to London to try to do something on an emergency
                    basis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an equivalent of a Senator from Folger's, which
                        is one of the big coffee producers?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Not really, but from time to time there were people in the Congress that
                    would get involved in this, and particularly in the '70s; I don't know if you
                    want to save that for chronological purposes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to talk right now from the '68-'74 period.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>KATZ: Let me just stay on coffee and finish that. In the early '70s there was,
                    for a number of reasons, an explosion of commodity prices. Partly driven by the
                    energy crisis, and by inflation in the world, and also production cycles,
                    particularly in the case of coffee and coffee prices began to rise. And so the
                    issues became more contentious. The dollar was also falling. The U.S. had gone
                    off of gold in 1971, which was probably another inflationary factor, and the
                    coffee producers were saying we had to increase the price of coffee in order to
                    compensate them for the loss and value of the dollar.</p>
                <p>Coffee was being priced in dollars. So as the value of the dollar fell, in
                    relation not only to gold, but to other currencies, they were saying they were
                    in a bad position and therefore we had to raise the price of coffee. One of the
                    differences in the coffee agreement as opposed to other agreements it that we
                    did not try to push prices beyond the cyclical level. There are two ways of
                    dealing with prices and that is to try to control the broad cyclical changes, as
                    opposed to the smaller year-to-year changes. And what we tried to do was to
                    stabilize prices within these larger cyclical trends. Basically we looked at the
                    prices on an annual basis and we thought, well, if they were a little too low,
                    we'd try to push them up a little, and if they were a little too high, we would
                    try a little more supply. But we weren't going to try to bring about a massive
                    change. We didn't think it was possible or desirable.</p>
                <p>About this time also there began to be some congressional interest in rising
                    coffee prices. One congressman in particular, Freddy Richman, who made a lot of
                    money in the casket business in St. Louis, somehow ended up in a constituency in
                    Brooklyn. It was a low income area, although he himself lived on Park Avenue.
                    I'm not quite sure how he managed that. He got on my case, so I had a number of
                    contentious sessions with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his interest?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Well, he was representing a consumer interest, or so he claimed. He was
                    Chairman of a Subcommittee of the Agriculture Committee on Consumer Affairs, and
                    that was his platform. But he was a pretty outrageous guy and he later got into
                    trouble. You know, time wounds all heels, and he later was apprehended by the
                    Capitol Police for soliciting Capitol Pages. And then was finally censured for
                    dealing in marijuana or maybe other substances, so as I say, I thought it all
                    came out pretty well at the end from my viewpoint.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>In 1975 there was a disastrous frost in Brazil. It was a 100-year frost in Brazil
                    and wiped out a tremendous amount of coffee production. And prices zoomed. They
                    had generally been under one dollar. When I started, they were in the 30-40
                    cents per pound. They got to $5.00 per pound in 1975, and there was a
                    congressional investigation. Abe Rosenthal, who was Chairman of the Foreign
                    Affairs Subcommittee held a hearing, and Richmond was present. That was one of
                    the worst hearings that I ever attended. Generally, I did very well in
                    Congressional hearings. But this was a very contentious hearing. In addition I
                    had with me, Joan Braden, who was the consumer representative in the State
                    Department with me. And she was more than a bit of a problem, because she
                    decided she didn't like the coffee agreement either. And I said, “Look, this is
                    a Treaty, to which the United States was a party and underlying that was a
                    policy approved by the President, and you can't go up there and testify against
                    the Administration's policy.” And she said, “Well, I'm the consumer
                    representative.” I said, “Well, then you go up and testify, because I'm not
                    going to go up with you tagging along.” We had a little confrontation before the
                    Under Secretary, Chuck Robinson who was reluctant to take a stand.</p>
                <p>Finally, we agreed that I would be the State Department representative and Braden
                    would accompany me, but adhere to policy. She sat there and squirmed, but said
                    almost nothing.Year's later, I found an autobiography of hers on the clearance
                    rack of Crown Books. As I leafed through it, sure enough there was a reference
                    to me that was not unflattering, but in one passage she said that I regarded her
                    as a “pain in the ass.” I thought to myself that I never actually expressed the
                    thought, but I surely agreed with the sentiment.</p>
                <p>The most contentious moment in the Hearing was when Rosenthal turned to some
                    testimony that I had given on a previous occasion. He said, reading from a text,
                    “You said that prices should not go up.”</p>
                <p>One of my aides sitting behind me quickly found the passage which read, “Barring
                    some new production disasters, prices should not go up from these levels.” I
                    attempted to read the full passage, but Rosenthal would not let me do so, saying
                    “Answer the question, yes or no, didn't you say prices would not go up?” I said,
                    “If you will permit to read the full sentence of what I had said ...” Again he
                    said, “Answer the question, yes or no.” And when I tried one more time , he
                    said, “Mr. Katz, you are right on the edge.” At that I shut the book, slammed it
                    on the desk, and sat there and glowered at him. After a minute or so, he said,
                    “O.K., now you can read it.” and I opened the book and read the full
                    passage.”</p>
                <p>After the Hearing had ended, one of the Republican members came up to me and
                    said, “Mr. Katz I admired your forbearance.” I thanked him, but said, “Gee, I
                    didn't think I was all that calm.” That was the worst Congressional experience I
                    ever had. For the most part, my other experiences were quite favorable and I had
                    excellent relationships with members and Congressional staff.</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>There is another issue in this period, that was extremely important, and that is
                    energy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then let's talk about energy. Because this was all of a
                        sudden that it became THE issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes, starting from 1967 I began to become increasingly involved in energy
                    policy. There was an issue with Canada over their oil exports to us, and in 1969
                    the Nixon Administration undertook a major study of our oil import program. That
                    program was instituted by the Eisenhower Administration in 1959 and by 1969 had
                    become riddled with problems and inconsistencies.</p>
                <p>Another major issue that became active in 1969 was textile policy. Perhaps we can
                    leave that for the next time, even though we will be skipping ahead
                    chronologically.</p>
                <p>I suggest that we tackle the energy story first by talking about the Oil Import
                    Program review. Next we can deal with the Canada issue. The we can with the
                    larger energy issue which became the Energy Crisis of the 1970's.</p>
                <p>Early in the Nixon Administration it was decided that the ten year old Oil Import
                    Program should be subjected to a thorough going review. As I said, by 1969, the
                    program had become riddled with anomalies. The program was intended to promote
                    national security by limiting imported oil, except those received overland. The
                    idea was that by limiting the import of “cheap” crude oil, we assured the
                    viability of our domestic drilling and producing industry. The effect of course
                    was to drain our domestic reserves, but the national security justification was
                    a thinly veiled cover for old fashioned protectionism.</p>
                <p>At any event. overland imports of crude oil from Canada were exempt from control,
                    but oil from Venezuela, coming through the Caribbean were deemed “insecure”, and
                    thus subject to quota.</p>
                <p>Mexico provided an interesting example of the distorting effects of bad policy.
                    Since the volumes of oil from Mexico were too small to justify the building of a
                    pipeline, they came by tanker and were thus also restricted. However, someone
                    discovered a loophole. Heavy crude oil from Mexico was brought by tanker to
                    Brownsville, Texas, off-loaded “in-bond” onto tanker trucks, which had to be
                    heated, because the oil was heavy and would gel. The trucks would then go round
                    a traffic circle, and proceed back to the ship, where the oil would be reloaded
                    onto the ship. The ship would then proceed to refineries at Wilmington,
                    Delaware. Because the oil entered the U.S. customs territory from an in-bond
                    facility, they were deemed to have entered overland, and were thus exempt from
                    control. This came to be known as the “Brownsville Loop”.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>Another anomaly was the situation with Canada. As I noted, overland imports from
                    Canada were exempt. They could hardly be regarded as insecure. This resulted in
                    complaints of discrimination from Venezuela, which argued, with some validity
                    that imports through the Caribbean could not really be regarded as insecure. To
                    make matters more complicated, production in Canada were beginning to expand as
                    were exports into the U.S. Since Canadian oil received the benefit of the
                    premium U.S. price, this provided a great stimulus to the Canadian industry.
                    Also northern tier U.S. states which did not have good pipeline access to crude
                    oil from the Gulf Coast were increasing their demand for Canadian crude.</p>
                <p>Thus beginning in 1967 and continuing through 1969, we pressured the Canadian
                    Government to take action to reduce their crude oil exports to us. The Canadians
                    were not prepared to control exports formally, but did jaw-bone their industry,
                    not too successfully. This became a sore point in our relations over this
                    period.</p>
                <p>The other significant anomaly was the growth of the small refiner industry. The
                    way the Program worked was through the issuance of oil import permits, or
                    tickets, to refiners. Since imported oil was a dollar or more cheaper per barrel
                    than domestic oil, the tickets were worth the amount of the difference in price
                    and were traded as securities. Tickets were initially allocated on an historical
                    basis, but over time, and through political pressure, they began to be allocated
                    to new refiners, whose true purpose was to capture the economic rent from the
                    quota system. There were in fact documented cases of refiners who earned more
                    revenue through the sale of tickets than from refinery throughput.</p>
                <p>The overriding factor leading to the review of the oil Program was that our
                    domestic production had peaked and we were clearly going to need increasing
                    levels of imports. The review of the Program was undertaken by an interagency
                    task force headed by George Shultz who at the time was Secretary of Labor. He
                    had come to this position from the University of Chicago where he was a
                    Professor of Labor Economics. The Executive Director of the task force was Phil
                    Areeda, a distinguished Harvard Law Professor.</p>
                <p>The major conclusion of the review was that the existing program did not
                    adequately protect national security and that imports should be liberalized, but
                    not fully decontrolled. there was a considerable debate within the task force
                    whether there really was a threat of supply disruptions from insecure sources.
                    We in the State Department argued that the Middle East was likely to be an
                    increasing supplier and that it was inherently an unstable, if not insecure,
                    source of supply. The conclusion of the task force was that the answer to the
                    problem of insecurity was diversity and that efforts should be made to increase
                    supply from Western Hemisphere sources.</p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>This brings us back to Canada, with whom we initiated an intensive negotiation on
                    energy security in 1970. I should note at this point that the main players in
                    this effort, in addition to myself as Deputy Assistant Secretary, were Phil
                    Trezise, who was then the Assistant Secretary for Economic Affairs and the
                    Director of the Office of Fuels and Energy, Jim Akins, who was an interesting
                    personality.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a bit about Akins because his name comes
                        up, and I've seen him in operation just a little bit. It sounds like there's
                        a tremendous ego which sort of gets in the way of things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: That is a fair way of putting it. Extremely smart, very knowledgeable. He
                    was educated as a nuclear physicist, I believe. He had an engineering
                    background. But then he taught English at the American University in Beirut and
                    really became an Arabist. And then he got into petroleum.</p>
                <p>But, back to Canada. As I said, the situation with Canada was somewhat anomalous.
                    On the one hand, we wanted Canadian oil. It was secure, at least for the time.
                    It did meet the need of Midwest refineries that didn't have access to oil from
                    the Gulf of Mexico. But what was happening was that Canadian oil was beginning
                    to penetrate beyond the small refineries along the border and was coming into
                    the middle of the country. And this presented two problems: one, there was
                    competition with independent refiners in the U.S. who had ties to independent
                    petroleum producers. And there was problem with Venezuela, I mentioned
                    before.</p>
                <p>What was happening was that Venezuelan oil which then couldn't come into the U.S.
                    was going into eastern Canada, while we were importing from western Canada. So
                    you had this strange kind of triangular trade. Also, because of Canadian
                    geography and topography, their pipelines didn't go west to east. They couldn't
                    easily supply their own requirements in eastern Canada. In a free trade
                    environment, this might have happened anyway. But because of the distortions of
                    the Oil import Program and its associated political problems, the growing volume
                    of imports from Canada became an irritant.</p>
                <p>Sometime in 1970, however, another thing began to bother us. The demand-supply
                    situation was beginning to change and relations between the oil producing states
                    of the Middle East and the major oil companies were becoming somewhat more
                    contentious. We began to become concerned about a potential problem with Canada.
                    If there were to be a supply interruption in the Middle East, as had been
                    threatened by Arab producers, it would result in a rearranging of supply lines.
                    Canada was importing some oil from the Middle East at the time, as well as from
                    Venezuela. Venezuelan oil might be diverted from Canada to Europe and to the
                    United States. We were concerned that Canada might then divert their mid-west
                    shipments to eastern Canada.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>The Canadians did not agree with, arguing that they could not divert oil to the
                    east because of the lack of pipelines. There was, in fact, a small diameter,
                    east to west pipeline, but clearly inadequate. We in turn argued that but they
                    would be under tremendous political pressure to supply eastern Canada. We said,
                    “You couldn't just let them go cold in the east; you would deliver it in pails
                    if you had to.”</p>
                <p>We thus proposed discussions on how to protect our mutual security interests, and
                    thus began a series of meetings with the Canadians about oil supply in
                    particular and energy in general. At some point, some Canadian, I don't remember
                    now who it was, talked about a continental energy policy, which later became
                    anathema to Canadians. Politically, in Canada, continentalism was a bad thing
                    because it suggested Canada would become the 51st state. It used to be that they
                    did not want to be the 49th state. I used to say to the Canadians that they
                    waited too long. They could have been the 49th and now they were going to be the
                    51st. But in any case, we had this series of conversations at fairly high
                    levels. Phil Trezise, who was the Assistant Secretary, and I, and Peter
                    Flanagan, who was a counselor to President Nixon.</p>
                <p>KATZ: In these discussions with Canada we talked about various things like
                    pipeline connections, we talked about gas supply, we talked about coal trade in
                    which we had a vigorous trade with Canada going North. Generally we imported oil
                    and gas from Canada in increasing amounts. We were also beginning to import some
                    electricity and we exported coal to Canada. We tried to put this into a context,
                    but Canadians were very resistant that smacked of a continental policy. And they
                    were mostly foot dragging. Until about 1973. In the beginning of 1973, the
                    Canadians had begun a national security study of their own, and concluded that
                    yes, there were certain circumstances in which they could be vulnerable. So it
                    was not until then that they recognized there was a security problem, and they
                    developed a contingency plan to reverse the small east-west pipeline and be able
                    to have it flow west-east, and to expand the capacity. The problem with building
                    pipelines across Canada is the geology, not being able to very easily dig
                    pipelines. But that was then overtaken by the larger event, which was the Arab
                    oil embargo later in 1973.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we leave Canada, I wonder if you could talk a bit
                        about dealing with the Canadians. There's one theme that runs through
                        interviews. People who have had to deal with the Canadians on things, it's
                        like dealing with your next door neighbor. Everything is very intimate. We
                        both know everything, and yet it can be very acrimonious and very difficult.
                        How did you find it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>KATZ: The next door neighbor is a good analogy. Not only because they are our
                    next door neighbor, but the degree of familiarity is much greater than it is
                    with most other countries in the world. And the other thing is that they speak
                    the same language. Not only the same language, but increasingly in the same
                    vernacular. In my early encounters there were still some people in Canada that
                    had sort of funny accents. After a while they were indistinguishable from
                    Americans. Negotiations at certain points were not only acrimonious but very
                    blunt and spiced with locker room expressions. The other problem with Canada was
                    that Canada suffered from a small country mentality. They tend to be somewhat
                    defensive. That, I think, has changed over time, but there was one other problem
                    that I particularly became aware of in later years, and that is because of this
                    kind of intimacy with people knowing one another very well, there began to be
                    lingering resentments, especially on the part of American officials, you know —
                    “By God, you pulled this little brother act on me last time and you're not going
                    to get away with it again.” There were a series of incidents like that.</p>
                <p>There were in the 1960's and early 1970's a number of outstanding senior Canadian
                    civil servants, Deputy Ministers, known as the Mandarins. People like Ed Ritchie
                    of External, Jake Warren of Trade and Commerce, Jim Grandy of the Privy Council,
                    and Simon Reisman of Treasury. They were people of broad experience, and
                    typically had served in several cabinet departments. They were also people of
                    vision and political courage. While we did not always agree, we (particularly
                    Phil Trezise and I) did get on well together with much mutual respect.</p>
                <p>Reisman became a legendary figure, in part because he was such a strong
                    personality. He was called out of retirement to lead the Canadian side in the
                    U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, which added to the legend. He was known to
                    tangle with colleagues and politicians, as well as with Americans.</p>
                <p>Why don't we get back to the energy story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q. O.K.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Late in 1970 and 1971, Jim Akins, as Director of the Office of Fuels and
                    Energy began calling attention to what he saw as a developing crisis in energy.
                    He noted that fact that relations with producing countries were becoming more
                    difficult. There were contentious negotiations by the oil companies with Libya
                    in particular, and the Shah continually wanted more money, and the Saudis wanted
                    more money, and so on. There was a kind of leap frogging process. One country
                    would raise the price a little bit, another country would then want to catch up
                    and move ahead and so forth. There were also changes in the demand for energy.
                    Demand was burgeoning. Production and exploration for various reasons hadn't
                    kept up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When we are talking about energy, we are really talking
                        about petroleum.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>KATZ: We are talking primarily about oil. It becomes larger in scope,
                    encompassing gas but the issue was really being driven by oil. Other changes
                    were taking places, such as new environmental regulations which changed the kind
                    of oil we needed. We needed lighter oils, less heavy and low in sulfur, which
                    put a premium on some countries like Libya. And throughout this period there
                    were difficult negotiations between the companies and the producing countries
                    over prices. And then of course then came the 1973 war, and the embargo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are talking about the Egyptian-Syrian attack on
                        Israel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes, the war came late in 1973, the Arab-Israeli War. The Arab boycott
                    followed and then prices exploded. At one moment, In October prices were doubled
                    by the Iranians and the Arab states, and then by December prices were doubled
                    again.</p>
                <p>Jim Akins, blossomed in this period. You characterized him well. He was really
                    quite arrogant and intemperate. He was seeking and getting more and more
                    publicity, and while that didn't bother me at all, some of his public utterances
                    did. He was a very bright fellow, and I think he was prescient in many ways. But
                    he would make some outrageous statements, and at one point I remember calling
                    him in. He had just given a speech, the content of which I found very
                    objectionable. The speech, of course, had not been cleared by me or anyone else.
                    He was making predictions, and my concern was that they could be self-fulfilling
                    predictions. And I said, “Jim, you and I have got to come to an understanding.
                    Either you are going to work for me or I”m going to work for you. Now I'll do it
                    either way, but we can't go on this way, where you just go off on your own, and
                    make statements that I think are terrible.” He said, “Jules, you're absolutely
                    right. If I were you, I couldn't stand me.”</p>
                <p>So, we'd have these occasional flairups, but basically we got on all right as
                    long as I could control him, but I couldn't very often. At one point, there was
                    a blowup, when he said the price of oil was going to $10.00 a barrel. I said,
                    “How can you say that?” And he said, “Well, look at the demand-supply curve.” He
                    had a curve, and he showed demand going up in a straight line projection. And I
                    said, “Jim, demand is not infinite. At some price, demands turns down.” He said,
                    “You don't understand the oil business. You're looking at this as an economist.”
                    And I said, “Well, I think economics matters.” “Well, but you don”t understand
                    the oil business. Demand is infinite.” And I said, “Well look, that”s just
                    ridiculous.” Now, as it turned out, the prices did go to $10.00 a barrel. And at
                    some point later, he said, “I told you so.” And I said, “Yes, but you were
                    wrong. Because you said they were going to get there some years later. You got
                    the $10.00, but your timing was way off.”</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>At any event, after the Arab world boycott, I became even more involved in energy
                    policy than before. Bill Casey became the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs,
                    and he became more and more interested in oil policy. This was even before the
                    Arab-Israeli War. And in fact, we worked together on a speech that he was going
                    to give at the OECD, laying out an energy policy for the OECD, which
                    unfortunately went over as a lead balloon, mostly because his delivery was so
                    bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say, William Casey almost became notorious
                        as the head of the CIA during the Reagan Administration, but that he mumbled
                        an awful lot.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: He always mumbled, but he was an incredible person in many ways. He was a
                    man of great intellect, a voracious reader, who would read anything he could get
                    his hands on. His desk was literally piled 18 inches high, with papers and
                    books. I don't know how many books he read in a week, but he just read
                    everything he could get his hands on. But kind of a floppy man, floppy clothing,
                    papers coming out of his pockets. After he left the State Department, I
                    encountered him on the New York shuttle, and he had a leather portfolio. He was
                    getting seated as I came by, and I said, “Oh, Hi Bill, what are you doing? He
                    said, I”ve got to get back to New York. I just got into my trust account,” and
                    his portfolio had papers coming out of it, and there were bonds and other
                    securities coming out of it. I was afraid that if he walked out onto the tarmac
                    they would all blow away. I was a great admirer of his, and I was very sorry
                    about his end. He was always fascinated about intelligence. He had, of course,
                    been in OSS during the war.</p>
                <p>In any event, this policy that we tried to establish in the OECD didn't go over
                    very well. But then came the Arab-Israeli War, and the price of oil exploded.
                    Henry Kissinger by then was Secretary of State. He became very absorbed in the
                    issue because it was obviously tearing the NATO alliance apart and had important
                    ramifications in terms of Middle Eastern policy. So from that point on, I had
                    become increasingly involved in it, in 1972 and 1973, but then especially
                    thereafter, I was closelinvolved in it. I should also note that what we had
                    tried to sell in the OECD speech formed the basis of the program pursued by the
                    International Energy Agency that was created in 1974.</p>

                        and talk about energy and how after the war you became more and more

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess we'd better come to the oil crisis. For somebody
                        to be reading this some years later, could you talk about what happened,
                        before you talk about how it hit us.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Just to put this in a little bit of context, of course, oil is a commodity.
                    And a commodity in the sense that there are boom and bust cycles. Most
                    commodities have cycles because there are booms in investment, overproduction, a
                    collapse of prices, a collapse in investment, consumption goes up, the capacity
                    doesn't keep up and then you have another spiking up of prices, and then the
                    cycle begins all over again. After the Suez crisis in 1956, particularly by
                    1960, there was a collapse in oil prices. Prices fell to pretty close to $1.00 a
                    barrel. It was about that period that we instituted our own oil import program,
                    partly for that reason. Our own producers couldn't compete, so we protected
                    them. And then about the same time, in 1960, OPEC was formed. OPEC was created
                    among a number of oil producing countries, with Venezuela in the lead. And also
                    in the years that followed, there was increasing government takeovers of oil
                    production, by way of nationalization. Governments in producing countries became
                    more involved in pricing and producing decisions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your position again was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: My position at the time was Deputy Assistant Secretary for International
                    Resources and Food Policy and energy was one of several offices that reported to
                    me. The Office of Fuels and Energy, which was headed by Akins, a Food Policy
                    division, and a Metals and Minerals division. In addition to energy, I spent a
                    lot of time in agricultural policy as well, particularly coffee. But
                    increasingly energy was beginning to preoccupy my time.</p>
                <p>Beginning from about 1971-72, and then certainly into '73, there was a general
                    inflation, which was also further stimulating this pressure on oil prices. And
                    in early '73, there were negotiations between the oil producers and the oil
                    companies. Both the Libyans on the one hand, and then the Gulf producers and the
                    Iranians. For a number of years, the Shah had been putting pressure on the
                    companies both to increase production and increase prices to finance his
                    insatiable need for revenue. And what began to happen was kind of a
                    leap-frogging. In the Libyan negotiations, going back to 1970-71 there were
                    several times when there was an impasse, and interestingly in the light of
                    history, what they were arguing about were pennies and then dimes. The Libyans
                    wanted an increase in price and the companies offered something like $.09, and
                    the Libyans said they wanted $.30, and companies finally got up to $.16 and I
                    think they broke off negotiations at about $.21. The Libyans finally got an
                    increase but this led to a process of leap frogging, with the Saudis insisting
                    on a greater increase., and then the Iranians, and then another round of the
                    same.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the U.S. government's role in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: The U.S. government's formal role was that of an very interested bystander,
                    occasionally making diplomatic representations because we were concerned about
                    the economic and political stability of the area, and of course, the stability
                    of oil supply. So we weren't so much taking positions saying no, you shouldn't
                    ask for more than $.21 or $.31; we were urging moderation on the part of
                    governments, and negotiation on the part of the companies.</p>
                <p>There was a time when Jack Irwin, who was the Deputy Secretary, went over to the
                    Middle East on a mission at a particularly crucial moment and that was
                    interpreted as a lot more U.S. government involvement. But as I say, we were
                    trying to play a middle role, this was between the companies and the
                    governments. Middle is perhaps not accurate — we weren't precisely in the
                    middle, we were off-center, urging price restraint, but we were not a party at
                    the negotiating table.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about other governments?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: The British and the French were clearly involved. ARAMCO did involve the
                    British, but not the French. And the Italians, of course, were in there as
                    mavericks and felt left out, and so they were making their own deals where they
                    could, the effect of which was to bid up the price.</p>
                <p>As you know, there were many characterizations of the energy crisis as a
                    conspiracy, either an OPEC conspiracy, or a U.S. government conspiracy with
                    OPEC. But what was really driving all of this were market forces. The oil demand
                    was burgeoning and ultimately peaked. For various reasons, capacity hadn't grown
                    as fast as demand, because of the long depressed prices from about 1960 to 1970.
                    And increasing involvement of governments, which made it more and more difficult
                    to invest in new capacity. But by the spring of 1973, it was clear that this was
                    becoming more and more of a problem. Even concern about ultimate supply.</p>
                <p>It was at this point of time that Bill Casey and I went to the OECD ministerial
                    meeting to outline a collective energy policy for OECD countries, which involved
                    some form of oil sharing in a crisis, a conservation program, and stimulation of
                    alternative sources of energy. I worked very hard on this. These were not just
                    my ideas, they were a collection of ideas that we had been talking about for
                    some time. In fact, there had been various efforts in the U.S. government along
                    these lines too, to establish new energy programs, which didn't get very
                    far.</p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>Up to that point energy policy had been pretty much in the Department of the
                    Interior, and the Office of Emergency Preparedness, headed by retired General
                    Abraham Lincoln — distantly related, as I recall. Shortly thereafter, the
                    Federal Energy Agency was created, which became the Department of Energy in the
                    Carter Administration. Jim Akins, of course, again had a lot to do with
                    stimulating action in the government.</p>
                <p>To a digress for a moment, he wrote a report which was quite a good description
                    of the problem and the vulnerability we faced, and it was sent around to various
                    Cabinet officers, and one afternoon I got a call from Admiral Rickover, still
                    head of the nuclear program. In a very peremptory way, he said, “I understand
                    that the State Department has produced a report on energy, and I want to have a
                    copy of it.” And there was something about his tone of voice that ticked me
                    off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was renowned for ticking people off.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: I was still pretty feisty in those days. I said, “Well, it's a classified
                    report, and you can get it from the Secretary of Defense.” And he said, “Are you
                    telling me that I can't have this report?” And I said, “As I said, you can get
                    it through appropriate channels.” I don't remember the other specific comments,
                    but the conversation got pretty loud, and my last comment was “Listen Admiral,
                    I'm not one of your tinhorn sailors.” This was loud enough that one of my
                    assistants two offices down came into my office and said, “My God, what was that
                    all about?” And I said, “That was Admiral Rickover.” That got to be a big joke
                    in the office thereafter.</p>
                <p>Anyway, to get back to the story, the point is that there had been a lot of work
                    that we had been doing, and I give Jim a lot of credit for this. I don't know
                    where he was at that time, and why he wasn't at the OECD meeting. But we
                    produced this speech, Casey gave the speech, and it went over like a lead
                    balloon, but it stood us in good stead for what was to unfold in the remainder
                    of the year, or in the following year. Because by early October, there was
                    another round of company negotiations with the oil producers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: October of ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: 1973.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which was just in time for the last of the series of
                        Arab-Israeli wars, too, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>KATZ: That's right. But just preceding that, there was another negotiation
                    between the oil producers and the OPEC countries in Vienna, and a very
                    acrimonious negotiation. It was broken off, and for the first time, the OPEC
                    states then imposed a price increase, and they roughly doubled the price of oil.
                    Just almost days after that, within the week, came the Arab-Israeli War.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So I think sometimes it's forgotten that OPEC made the
                        move before war started, and the war was not particularly building up, I
                        mean it came as a great surprise.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Absolutely. But the two events quickly coincided. And then soon after that,
                    the Arab states declared a boycott against the United States and other countries
                    who were supporting Israel. And then almost immediately or soon after that, the
                    Shah then doubled the price again, so there had been a quadrupling of the price
                    within a matter of months. This then set into motion some furious diplomatic
                    activity, and what was happening at the time was what we feared most, and that
                    was that there was a scramble for oil, particularly among the European
                    countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Japan too?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: And Japan. And incidentally, one of the worst actors was an American
                    company, that went out and bid well above the OPEC price in an auction in
                    Nigeria. At the time it was a shocking price for oil, well over $10.00 a barrel,
                    I think it was $16.00 a barrel. The firm was Coastal States, which was a small
                    oil company on the Gulf coast, I think out of Texas. Then the Shah called for an
                    auction, and people were bidding which at the time seemed like astronomical
                    prices, almost up to $10.00 a barrel. So Jim Akins' prediction of $10.00 a
                    barrel came true, but as I said to him, it came a lot earlier than he had
                    predicted, but obviously for a very different reason.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can I capture the mood of the State Department in your
                        particular view of these moves of the Shah, of OPEC. Were these people all
                        of a sudden villains? How did we feel about them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: I wouldn't say they were villains. Obviously, they were acting in ways that
                    were inimical to our interests, but they were pursuing their interests. Our
                    views were obviously colored by our own concerns. We thought also that they were
                    really not acting in their own long-term interests. By pushing up prices as fast
                    as they were, they were running various risks, which incidentally came to pass.
                    That is what finally did the Shah in. When all that money began to be
                    distributed around, the economy and politics of the country were destabilized.
                    We had not exactly predicted the Shah's ultimate fate. We just felt that it
                    would all be destabilizing to the country and to the region.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nixon, if anything, was renowned for having sort of an
                        enemies list, which got very personal. Did this translate? Vindictiveness
                        was one of the hallmarks of not just Nixon, but some of his supporters, who
                        were basically political types, Haldeman, Ehrlichman, domestically, but did
                        you get any feel for this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: I had no direct contact with Nixon. I had a lot of contact with Peter
                    Flanagan, and I got on very well with him, although there were a couple of times
                    when I had shouting matches with him. There was one time in particular when I
                    said, “You are probably going to throw me out or get me fired or something, but
                    I don't give a damn, you're absolutely wrong.” He said, “Look, when you have
                    something to say, you say it. That's what I like about you.” He was a pretty
                    feisty Irishman, but we got on very well together. Beyond that I do not recall
                    anything in terms of vindictiveness toward the oil producers. We were just too
                    wrapped up in the problems of the hour. Things were just moving very rapidly.
                    Also the oil producers had us over a barrel, no pun intended, and I don't know
                    what we could have done, if we had wanted to take punitive action.</p>
                <p>Now, it was about this time, this was when Nixon disappeared, well, he left in
                    1974. But in September of 1973, Kissinger came to the State Department. And so,
                    things changed in the State Department. Kissinger very quickly became involved
                    in the Arab oil embargo. First of all, he became very involved in the Middle
                    East crisis, and went to the Middle East. I recall when he came back, a
                    fascinating description of his trip, with two particular things that I remember:
                    his praise for Sadat — Sadat was the person that impressed him most on his trip.
                    He said he was the only person over there that he encountered that had some
                    sense of strategy, of having some sense of where he wanted to go and how he
                    would get there. All the others all had this view that somehow the Messiah would
                    come in from the dessert and save them all, but didn't have a clue. And the
                    other thing that I remember were his meetings in Saudi Arabia. He was just full
                    of excitement about this. And I suspect his Jewish background may have had
                    something to do with it. I mean, he never alluded to that, but here he was, in
                    Saudi Arabia. But he was apparently treated with great respect. But one of the
                    comments he made; he'd had these conversations with the King, and then he went
                    back to his room and he said all through the night people kept knocking on his
                    door, different princes or personalities kept calling on him. One comment was,
                    “You must understand the King, he”s old and he's stiff-necked.” But there were
                    different messages being given, and he said everybody had a slightly different
                    view. He said it was just like the NSC.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Arab-Israeli October war was over rather quickly, but
                        the oil crisis remained. Kissinger has a certain reputation of not being
                        particularly comfortable on economic things. How did you find him on this,
                        because this was something you couldn't ignore.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>KATZ: That's absolutely right, and Kissinger of course, had a lesson in economics
                    going back to 1971, and we didn't cover that, and we need to do that. That is,
                    the Nixon New Economic Program. Let's finish energy. Kissinger's approach to
                    economics was same as to everything else, and that is, that there had to be some
                    strategic purpose in all of this and it had to fit in with our strategic
                    objectives. And what he saw was that this crisis was tearing apart the alliance
                    because various European countries were scrambling for oil, were trying to cut
                    their own deals where they could.</p>
                <p>The oil companies, incidentally, were behaving very well, because it was in their
                    commercial interests to do so. They were kind of balancing supply, to kind of
                    keep all of their customers satisfied to the extent that they could. There was
                    one incident in the U.K. where the companies were called in to meet with the
                    government, and the message was something to the effect that Her Majesty's
                    government would not appreciate if the extraordinary arrangements they undertook
                    to supply oil to the United Kingdom were upset by the independent activities of
                    the companies. To their credit, British Petroleum told them to go bugger off.
                    They said, “unless we are ordered to do so, we will continue to supply our
                    customers in the way that we see fit.” So what we tried to achieve in the OECD
                    actually was being done by the companies. In fact, going back to the “67 war,
                    there was a special anti-trust waiver in U.S. law, which permitted the companies
                    to do this, to engage in these collusive arrangements basically to supply all
                    their customers. There was a procedure in law where the Attorney General could
                    waive the anti-trust laws for a specific period of time, and that waiver was
                    given during the 1973-74 embargo.</p>
                <p>In December 1973, Kissinger decided to take a trip to Europe. I went over with
                    Bill Donaldson, who had come in as Under Secretary for Security Affairs, but was
                    given the oil portfolio. That was one reason Casey left, although there were
                    other reasons. He called me into his office and he told me that he was leaving,
                    that he was going to the Ex-Im Bank and he said he had tried to resign before,
                    and Kissinger kept putting him off, and finally he said he was leaving.
                    Kissinger said, “Why are you leaving? I need you.” And he said, “Well, you don”t
                    need me, but you know, when Bill Rogers was here this was like a sedate law
                    firm. Now it's like a goddamn college seminar.” At any event, Donaldson came in
                    at that point, and I went off to Europe with him, and then Kissinger was in
                    Europe at about the same time and it ended up in a trip to London, where
                    Kissinger was going to make a speech to the Pilgrim Society. But what we found
                    was a real state of hysteria among the countries.</p>
                <p>In this speech, Kissinger laid out a plan, and this was a kind of typical
                    Kissinger approach. Calls came down from his office wanting some ideas. “We need
                    some kind of an action program.” In a moment of exasperation I said, “O.K.,
                    let's call it an energy action program.” And that's what went into the speech,
                    an “EAP”. It didn't have a whole lot of details, but called attention to this
                    problem of the alliance tearing itself apart. Somehow we had to have a
                    collective energy policy. In that speech, he called for a meeting of foreign
                    ministers, finance ministers, and energy ministers in Washington in early
                    February.</p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>He then returned from Europe and said, “Now what are we going to do in the Energy
                    Action Program?” So we began working, and I remember working all through New
                    Year's Eve, on a telegram, laying out some proposals. Ultimately, the Washington
                    Energy Conference in February 1974 developed a plan. It was also notable for the
                    action of the French, and the French Foreign Minister Jobert, who was a
                    Gaullist. He later, after Pompidou died, ran for President. One of his
                    statements in the campaign was “Countrymen, let it not be said that France is
                    being nice again.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the French?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: In a word, impossible. They did everything they could to frustrate this
                    conference and the coming together of a common approach. And in fact, what they
                    ultimately did was to ensure its success, because Jobert was so brutal in his
                    tactics and statements that he thoroughly alienated all of his European
                    colleagues. I recall one morning when the European Community ministers were
                    caucusing over the draft communique. The larger meeting was being delayed until
                    they concluded. We had stayed up all night writing a communique and a report and
                    the French were objecting, so the Community ministers went in to caucus and they
                    were in there quite a long time, and I was kind of hovering on the outside. This
                    was in the large conference room on the first floor in the State Department. And
                    then Henri Simonet, who was a member of the European Commission, came out of the
                    meeting, kind of red-faced. And I said “How is it going?” He said, “It's all
                    over. It”s finished. I just made a statement. And I said, if it's between the
                    Community and the Americans, I'm for the Americans and to hell with the
                    Community.” This was a Commissioner, a vice president of the Commission. What
                    happened in the end was is that the French isolated themselves, and everyone
                    went along with us in the face of the French objection. And what this ultimately
                    led to was the creation of the International Energy Agency in Paris, which the
                    French did not join, and to this day, are not members of. They cooperate with,
                    but are not members of the IEA.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our analysis or gut feeling about why the French
                        were doing this? Was it just the French being French? Or did they have a
                        rationale for not doing this, or national interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Their rationale was that this would irritate the Arabs; it would be seen as
                    a coalition against the Arabs, and it's not unlike what the French are doing
                    with Saddam Hussein. The French want to end the embargo with Saddam Hussein.</p>

                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>KATZ: Yes. It's what has become to be classic French behavior. The issue was
                    whether the industrialized countries, which was really what this represented,
                    basically the OECD countries, would be better off acting in solidarity, or would
                    everyone go their own way? And the French basically argued for countries going
                    their own way. The other countries were also concerned about something that
                    looked like an alliance against the Arabs, but the French were so blatant and so
                    brutal in their approach, that it really helped the U.S. position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that more or less, was the creation of this agency and
                        sort of everyone getting their ducks in line, help sort of stabilize the
                        situation, would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes. What came out of the conference was an Energy Action Group, and that
                    led to about six months of negotiations. I was traveling to Brussels every three
                    weeks to create the International Energy Agency. They developed an oil sharing
                    program, which never really functioned, because the 1973-74 crisis was even
                    beginning to diminish. Of course, there was the Iranian crisis later in the
                    decade, in the late 1970s, when it did come into force. That was not an embargo
                    situation, but a tightening of oil supply, another ramping up of oil prices. I”m
                    not absolutely sure, but I think the sharing mechanism was put into effect at
                    that point. But there were other forms of cooperation, on nuclear energy, on
                    conservation programs, and analysis, which helped the market. By the end of the
                    '70s, particularly after the Iranian crisis, of course oil prices began to fall,
                    from about 1981 on they've been really low, and in real terms they are quite a
                    bit lower than they were before.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While we are still on this, before we move back again,
                        dealing with economics, did the sudden wealth of Iran and the
                        Nixon-Kissinger almost delight in selling the Shah every new weapon system
                        you could get, did concern about that come to your office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Well, the concern of course, was with the amassing of wealth by the oil
                    states, and the concern about what that would do to monetary liquidity in the
                    world. You know, they were winning all of the chips in the game, and could the
                    game continue? This came to be known as the recycling problem. How could the oil
                    revenues be recycled? I recall making a remark at the time, “Well, don't worry,
                    they”ll find a way to waste all that money.” In any event, there were various
                    mechanisms put into effect to assure that the money would be recycled. But
                    basically they spent it all. It was the subject of a lot of conversation and
                    hand-wringing for several years, but it turned out not to be a problem. What
                    happened was that the Shah went on a spending spree, well, they all did, to the
                    point where ports in Nigeria were so crowded you couldn't land goods, and
                    similar problems in Iran. In Saudi Arabia, wealth was pretty well distributed. A
                    lot of folks became very rich, princes and nephews and cousins, and so forth.
                    Interestingly, subsequently some of those countries, including Saudi Arabia have
                    had budgetary and balance of payments problems. They did a lot of things like
                    growing wheat in the dessert, which I don't think has turned out to be terribly
                    successful.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In all this talk about the oil crisis, no mention is made
                        of the Soviet Union. Could you talk about how we saw them at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: The Soviet Union was not really very much of a factor, in the crisis or of
                    its management, although they were major exporters at the time. In the second
                    half of the 1970s there was concern about what the Soviets were doing to their
                    oil fields. The CIA came up with a report showing that the Soviets were
                    stripping their fields through bad management practices, and the implications
                    were that this would put further pressure on world oil supply. The particular
                    concern was that some countries, particularly in Western Europe, relying on
                    imports from the Soviet Union, would find themselves cut off after a while.</p>
                <p>There was also a similar report with respect to Saudi Arabia. The Foreign
                    Relations Committee, Chairman Frank Church, got onto this. I just happened to be
                    sitting in a briefing session the day before yesterday, with his chief staffer
                    Jerry Levinson, who was agitating on this and is now agitating on other issues.
                    But I think to some extent that the estimates about the Soviet fields proved to
                    be true, but probably also exaggerated, because there still are vast oil
                    reserves in the former Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>Concern about the Soviet fields also became an issue, late in 1978 and 1979, when
                    there was a decision by President Carter to cut off the supply of oil field
                    equipment to the Soviet Union because of the imprisonment of Anatoly Sharansky.
                    Jim Schlesinger was very much instrumental in that because he thought we ought
                    to do everything we could to impede the production of oil in the Soviet Union.
                    He and I had some arguments about that. Schlesinger was the first Secretary of
                    Energy.</p>
                <p>The Department of Energy was created in the Carter Administration. Jim
                    Schlesinger, of course, had been Director of the Office of Management and Budget
                    in the Nixon administration, and Secretary of Defense in the Ford
                    administration, and Secretary of Energy in the Carter administration. He had
                    also had been Chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission. He and I developed a
                    good, close relationship, particularly when he became Secretary of Energy. In
                    fact, when I retired from the State Department, he presented me with the
                    Department of Energy's Distinguished Service Medal. But he and I just disagreed
                    on this point about Soviet oil. My view was that our interests were in energy
                    supply. I didn't see why it was in our interest to have the Soviet Union in a
                    deficit position, putting a further drain on world supplies, but he saw it more
                    in a cold war sense, a way of putting pressure on them, and in fact, it was
                    probably one of the things that did help to contribute to the collapse of the
                    Soviet Union. So in the end, he may have been right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, you were dealing with energy up until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>KATZ: Well, up until I left, in 1979. I think just about the last week before I
                    finally retired, I went off to a ministerial meeting to the IEA in Paris, where
                    we were presenting some more proposals. So I pretty much stayed with it all
                    through that period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find a change with the Carter administration, as
                        far as the role of the State Department and your work dealing with
                        energy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Well, there were some differences, but not a major difference. The Energy
                    Department was created; there were policy issues that came up in connection
                    therewith, including energy legislation. There began to be a realization that
                    our domestic allocation program was more of a hindrance and a burden on energy
                    supply and oil supply than it was a help. But a lot of the issues that were
                    ostensibly domestic policy issues had international ramifications, so that I was
                    frequently involved in meetings at the White House.</p>
                <p>There was a meeting that took place at Camp David, an all day meeting with
                    President Carter. I happened to be the ranking available economic official in
                    the State Department at that moment. Dick Cooper, the Under Secretary for
                    Economic Affairs was off somewhere as was Secretary Vance and Christopher was
                    running the Department, I guess, so I went to this meeting. All the other people
                    were Cabinet officers: Blumenthal, Secretary of the Treasury; Schlesinger,
                    Secretary of Energy; Juanita Kreps, Secretary of Commerce, along with some White
                    House people, Hamilton Jordan, and Jody Powell. There must have been about a
                    dozen people around the table. One of the major issues was getting rid of the
                    allocation program and it was a rather interesting day, with Carter a hands on
                    participant.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would imagine the allocation program would be basically
                        a domestic political problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes, it was primarily a domestic problem, but it was hard to separate the
                    domestic from the international aspects of the energy problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Carter meld into the energy business?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>KATZ: Well, as I said, he was very hands on; very engaged in the conversation. I
                    just felt very comfortable in participating. I didn't feel at all inhibited. In
                    fact, when we broke for lunch, there were two large round tables, and I kind of
                    waited for my proper place and let the others go before me, and I found myself
                    at the end of the buffet line. The round tables were filled, and there was
                    Carter sitting with Juanita Kreps at a table for four, and he motioned for me to
                    join them. So here I was having lunch with the President of the United States.
                    He was so down to earth that I felt very comfortable. He was certainly very
                    knowledgeable, and wasn't so much putting forth his own views as soliciting the
                    views of other and trying to arrive at a consensus.</p>
                <p>There was one other experience I had with President Carter and that was with
                    natural gas supply negotiations with Mexico in 1979. This is out of
                    chronological sequence, but why don't we get it out of the way now. In the late
                    1970's we had the second energy crisis and were trying to obtain what energy
                    supplies we could, especially from reliable sources.</p>
                <p>In 1978, Mexico had indicated some interest in selling natural gas to us,
                    although this was a somewhat delicate political issue in Mexico. Jim
                    Schlesinger, the Secretary of Energy initiated negotiations with the Mexicans
                    which broke down over the question of price. The break off led to some
                    bitterness over some statements made by Schlesinger.</p>
                <p>Carter visited Mexico in early 1979 and the visit got off to a very bad start. At
                    the outset, Carter in a speech made a reference to his experience with
                    Montezuma's revenge during his honeymoon in Mexico. Secondly, President Lopez
                    Portillo delivered a rather bitter speech, detailing the affronts to Mexican
                    dignity suffered at the hands of Americans. When the formal meetings began the
                    next morning the atmosphere was distinctly chilly. Carter broke the ice by
                    asking whether the Mexican's wanted to look back or to go forward.</p>
                <p>Finally, it was decided that negotiations would be resumed and I was given
                    responsibility for the negotiations. Again, the main issue was price. While I
                    approached the task in a much less dogmatic way than had Schlesinger, there were
                    still limits to how far I could go. Our position, for one thing, was constrained
                    by the competition of natural gas with fuel oil. If the gas was priced too high,
                    it would not sell. Secondly, we were concerned about the effect of agreeing to
                    too high a price for fear that Canada would use that as a reason to raise its
                    price on sales to the U.S. And Canada supplied far more gas to the U.S. than
                    would Mexico.</p>
                <p>I traveled to Mexico seven times that year in an effort to find an agreement and
                    every time I got close the Mexicans would back away. They seemed to be quite
                    schizophrenic on whether they wanted a deal. This reflected the sensitivity of
                    the issue in Mexico.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>At one point in the negotiations I was called to meet with President Carter to
                    brief him on the state of the negotiations. He was clearly very interested and
                    wanted a deal. His questions interestingly reflected some concern on whether I
                    was being influenced by Schlesinger. I was not, but still there was a limit to
                    how far I thought the price could go. Finally, we came to a crunch, with the
                    negotiations about to break up, when Warren Christopher, the Under Secretary of
                    state stepped in and agreed to a price I considered over the line. I told him
                    so, saying that he could conclude the agreement but no gas would flow to the
                    U.S. market. That was in fact what happened. The deal was concluded, but before
                    the pipeline expansion could be completed, the price began to fall and very
                    little gas was imported from Mexico.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Turning from that, let's go right back to, you mentioned
                        Kissinger's learning about economics or something when he was with the
                        NSC?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes. He was the National Security advisor, but was a non-player on
                    international economic matters. In fact he was away from Washington during one
                    of the most important events of the Nixon Administration. What had happened was
                    that in 1971, we had what was considered then a serious balance of payments
                    problem. We were losing gold. We still had a lot of gold, but there was
                    increasing concern about this. I was not so much involved in this issue. I was
                    basically involved in resources and trade. Most of this took place in the
                    Treasury circle, with our Office of Monetary Affairs somewhat involved.</p>
                <p>In the middle of August, Under Secretary Nat Samuels was away on vacation. He was
                    somewhere up on a mountain in New Hampshire. And the Assistant Secretary, Phil
                    Trezise, was off on Mackinaw Island in Michigan, where there are no vehicles or
                    telephones. And I was Acting Assistant Secretary. I encountered somebody on the
                    street on Friday around lunchtime, and began talking about things going on, and
                    I said, “I sort of have a sense that there's something happening, but I can't
                    quite put my finger on it.” I don't remember now what exactly what led me to
                    that. And there was some discussion with my friend about some financial
                    developments in the markets in the world. Then we went off on our separate
                    ways.</p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>On Saturday night I went out to dinner with my wife, but before going out to
                    dinner we went out to Dulles Airport to meet a friend who was transiting, on his
                    way to Europe. We never actually got there because there was an air show, and
                    the traffic was so backed up we finally had to turn around. We went on to an
                    early dinner, and got home about 9 pm, and the phone was ringing. It was the
                    Operation Center in the State Department. They said, “My God, where in the world
                    have you been? We've been trying to reach you.” They had been paging me at
                    Dulles because someone in the office knew I was going out there, but I'd never
                    gotten there. And I said, “What”s going on?” They said, “The Secretary wants to
                    reach you. Are you going to be there?” And I said, “Yes, I'll be here the rest
                    of the evening.” And I never heard anything more. The next morning I had another
                    call from the Op Center, saying, “Are you going to be there? The Secretary wants
                    to talk to you.” “Yes, I'll be here.” I never did hear from the Secretary, but
                    finally about noon I got a call to be at the White House at 3 o'clock.</p>
                <p>I went to the White House, to the Cabinet Room, and there was John Connolly, who
                    was Secretary of the Treasury at that point, and Peter Peterson, who was
                    Counselor for Economic Affairs, and they were presenting a briefing. It was
                    August 15, 1971. And this came to be called President Nixon's New Economic
                    Program. And there were a number of dramatic steps that were taken. The U.S.
                    went off of gold; we closed the gold window; effectively devalued the dollar;
                    put a ten percent surcharge on imports; and put on wage and price controls. And
                    incidentally, this was because we had a balance of payments deficit of something
                    like $1 billion, and price inflation of 4%, but the program was somewhat
                    draconian. At the meeting also, were Jack Irwin, who was Deputy Secretary, and
                    Alex Johnson, who was Under Secretary for Political Affairs. All of this program
                    had been developed at Camp David from about Friday, Saturday, and Sunday
                    morning. There was no one at this meeting from the State Department, which was
                    to be the subject of later recriminations.</p>
                <p>I was then asked to stay behind afterwards because there were a whole lot of
                    things we had to do in terms of informing the rest of the world. After the
                    meeting broke up we went into Kissinger's office; Al Haig was there. Kissinger,
                    I think, was on vacation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: August is always an interesting month in Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes, and in the world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I always said that World War II started the first of
                        September, because you couldn't get it together before that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: And World War I started in August too, didn't it?</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: In any event, we then went into Kissinger's office and there were a series
                    of things to be done. The first thing was to bring all the foreign ambassador's
                    in and brief them on this. There were telephone calls to be made in the world
                    and various telegrams sent. And they said, “We're going to get all the
                    ambassadors into the State Department at 8 o'clock, and at 9 o'clock President
                    Nixon is going to deliver an address to the nation. I said, “You can't do that.”
                    “Why not”, I was asked. “Well,” I said, “You can't lock the diplomatic corps in
                    the conference room.” They said, “Well, we don't want them to get out and have
                    the word get out before the President comes on the air.” I said, “Well, if
                    you're going to do that, then do it afterward. It's too late to say you've
                    consulted or informed them beforehand. Brief them at 9:30.” Irwin and Johnson
                    agreed with me, and so that was agreed to. And there were some other
                    arrangements made.</p>
                <p>Then I was told to go over to the Treasury, to review all the telegrams that had
                    been prepared, announcing this programs in telegrams to our embassies abroad. So
                    I went over there, to John Petty's office, who was the Assistant Secretary for
                    International Affairs, and as I read through the telegrams, there was a message
                    to Ottawa providing notice to the Canadian government of our denunciation of the
                    Automotive Agreement with Canada. We were providing our six month's notice, or
                    maybe it was a one-year notice, with an intention to renegotiate. I asked where
                    did this come from? This wasn't mentioned in the briefing.” Petty said, “Oh,
                    that had been agreed to.” I said, “You can't do that. Maybe you can do this with
                    the Russians, you denounce the agreement, tear it up and say you'll start again.
                    But you should not do that with a friendly government and a close trading
                    partner.”</p>
                <p>What had happened was our surplus on automotive trade with Canada had gone from
                    something like $800 million positive to a deficit of something like $100
                    million. So this was part of this balance of payments approach. It was all
                    ridiculous, but anyway, Petty said, “Well, I'm sorry, it's decided that that's
                    it.” I said, “Well we will see about that.” So I got on the telephone and tried
                    to call Jack Irwin. The phones in his office were switched over to the Op
                    Center, and I couldn't get through to him, and I got kind of panicked. But
                    finally after a while I did reach him, and described the situation. He said,
                    “What can you do about it?” I said, “Give me the word, and I'll get it changed.”
                    He said, “Well, O.K., do your best.” And that was all the authorization I
                    needed.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>I went looking for Paul Volcker, who was the Under Secretary for Monetary Affairs
                    in the Treasury Department and had been central in putting this program
                    together. I was told he was having dinner in a conference room. So I went flying
                    down the hall to see him. It was now something like 6:30 pm. I raised problem
                    with him and he said, “Well, I don't understand, what is the problem?” I said,
                    “Well, you can't do this with a friendly government. Not only with a friendly
                    government, but you are going to cause tremendous disruption to the automotive
                    industry, which sits astride the border.” And he said, “Well, O.K., what would
                    you do?” I replied, “Well, if you want to negotiate, propose negotiations, or
                    renegotiations, but don't tear up the agreement.”</p>
                <p>Volcker agreed and said, “Well, O.K., then take it out of the package.” But his
                    press guy standing there says “But it's already in the press release.” He showed
                    it to me, and it was on one page. So I said, “Well, we'll just tear off the
                    page.” So we go flying down to the basement where this is all being assembled,
                    and it turns out that it's not on one page, it's printed back to back, so they
                    have to unstaple it. In those days they didn't have xerox machines, they had
                    mimeograph machines. So we had to tear off all these pages, rerun the page, and
                    this press guy was very irritated. And then someone comes running down, saying,
                    “Ziegler (Nixon's Press Secretary) is calling, and wants to know where the press
                    releases are.” I said, “Tell him to wait, damn it!”</p>
                <p>So I got it removed, and then went back to the State Department. I got called
                    into Secretary Roger's office, and he was there wearing dark glasses. He
                    apparently had an eye infection, but he was on the phone making telephone calls
                    to the Japanese Prime Minister and people in Europe, giving them notice.
                    Actually, the call to Japan came through while the President was on the air, so
                    there wasn't very much advance notice in all of this. And then the speech was
                    over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was, I think, the second Nixon shock, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: This was the second; the first one was the opening to China which had come
                    earlier that year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this one hit Japan very hard.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: That is right. And then there was a third shock in this package, which we
                    didn't know about at the time. Anyway, Rogers said “The President just called me
                    and he's very pleased the way all of this had worked out, but he wanted to know,
                    what was this thing about the Auto Agreement?” Somehow this had gotten back to
                    him. So I explained it to Rogers, and he sort of grunted, didn't say very much
                    about it.</p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>This was later described in a book in Canada, which I've never seen or gotten a
                    hold of, but anyway, I thought I had saved something at the time, some part of
                    our relationship with Canada. Right after that, the Canadians came roaring down
                    to Washington, because they were subject to this 10% import surcharge. This was
                    the first time Canada had been subjected to a general balance of payments
                    measure by the U.S. But had the Auto Agreement been denounced at that point,
                    that would have had catastrophic effect on our the relations with Canada.</p>
                <p>The other part of this package, which had not been disclosed at the briefing and
                    we didn't know about, was the textile action. We had been trying for some time,
                    since President Nixon had come into office, to discharge his commitment that
                    wool and manmade fibers would be brought within the textile and apparel
                    restraint arrangement. There was great resistance to this in Japan. Starting in
                    1969, in fact on Inauguration Day I was in Florida attending a convention. I got
                    a call down there saying that we'd been called to a meeting at the White House
                    on textiles. The meeting was to announce that the President had made a
                    commitment and we were going to get an agreement on the other fibers.</p>
                <p>Maurice Stans, the Secretary of Commerce, was put in charge of this, and he went
                    off to on a trip to Europe, and then I joined him on the second half of the trip
                    to the Far East. I had the Office of Textiles within my area of responsibility.
                    At the time, I was still Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Resources
                    and Food Policy, and the Office of Textiles was one of the offices that reported
                    to me. Joe Greenwald was the Deputy Assistant Secretary for International Trade.
                    Joe went on the first half of the trip, and I went on the second half of the
                    trip and joined Stans. And then I went on the Far Eastern trip with Stans, to
                    Tokyo, Seoul, Taipei, and Hong Kong. Those were the four major producers at the
                    time: Japan, Korea, Taiwan, and Hong Kong were the major sources of imports. All
                    of this was unsuccessful, and Japan was the focal point of the attack. The
                    feeling was that if we could get Japan, the others would come along.</p>
                <p>So, as part of this Camp David affair, a decision was made to impose an agreement
                    on Japan. I'm sorry, let me go back - After this first Stans effort, which came
                    to naught, there were further efforts made. And the White House kept insisting
                    that Japan would agree to do this. We in the State Department felt that Japan
                    would not do this, even though Prime Minister Sato had made a commitment, the
                    Prime Minister in Japan didn't have the power to do this. It was a consensus
                    decision. What we didn't know was that there were back channel communications
                    through CIA. The CIA station chief was passing messages between Sato and Nixon,
                    with Sato soliciting further pressure from the U.S..</p>
                <pb facs="0070" n="Page0070"/>
                <p>In any event, it all came to naught and Sato then came to Washington, and there
                    was great irritation by Nixon. Nixon said he wouldn't talk to him about it. Sato
                    was feeling very contrite, saying, “Well, I need more pressure.” So at the Camp
                    David meeting, it was agreed that the Trading With The Enemy Act would be
                    invoked against Japan, which was a rather extreme action, particularly the use
                    of that law. It was an authority to take various economic actions. The Trading
                    with the Enemy Act went back to 1918, and in 1933, President Roosevelt invoked
                    it because of the banking emergency, resulting from the collapse of the banks.
                    This happened to be the available authority, and FDR invoked it. And that
                    emergency stayed in effect until about 1977, when the law was changed and it
                    became the Economic Powers Act, with different controls on it. In any event,
                    that was the authority that was being used. When Rogers found out about this, he
                    was pretty upset. There was a rather tense meeting in this office with Peter
                    Peterson and David Kennedy, who had been Secretary of the Treasury and was
                    designated as a special negotiator for textiles. Rather remarkable, when you
                    think about it, I mean, how this subject could have occupied not only the
                    President of the United States, but you had a Special Representative of the
                    President for textiles.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think to see it in its context, Nixon won partly
                        by the Republican southern strategy, and the southern strategy was heavily
                        into supporting American textiles. We're talking about the '68 election. And
                        so, when Nixon came in this was sort of a major promise. So I think in that
                        context it makes sense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: It actually goes back to the Nixon-Kennedy campaign of 1960, when Nixon
                    thought he lost the campaign because of Kennedy's textiles promise. So in the
                    '68 campaign, he was determined not to be snookered twice, and so he made the
                    commitment, and they were determined to carry it out. To continue, Rogers was
                    pretty upset about this; he thought this was a pretty extreme thing to do, and
                    there were some tense moments in the conversation, at which point I and some
                    other people were asked to leave the room. But at one point Peterson said “Well,
                    the decision has been made.” (to threaten the Japanese with the Trading with the
                    Enemy Act). Rogers said, “Well, O.K., but the strategy better work, because
                    you're never going to do it again. You're not going to do it a second time, so
                    it better work this time.” Well, it did work, and it resulted ultimately in an
                    agreement with Japan and the other four countries. And it ultimately became the
                    multi-fiber agreement, which exists to this day, and is now scheduled to
                    disappear sometime early in the next century as a result of the Uruguay Round
                    negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the Tokyo Round. This is when.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>KATZ: The Tokyo Round took place from 1975 through 1979, a five-year period. But
                    the story begins in the early '70s. The Kennedy Round had been completed in
                    1968, and of course, all of these GATT rounds, series of negotiations, were
                    never designed to be the end of the affair. They were progressive
                    liberalizations and expansions in the rules structure of the international
                    trading system. So at the end of the Kennedy Round, in 1968, there was a lot of
                    unfinished business. Moreover, there was a problem that developed, because in
                    the Kennedy Round for the first time we tried to deal with non-tariff measures.
                    Prior to that the negotiations had dealt almost exclusively with tariffs. But
                    there were some non-tariff measures that we tried to deal with, but the
                    legislation didn't authorize the President to the President to negotiate on such
                    matters. These were negotiated ad referendum, subject to congressional
                    approval.</p>
                <p>There was an agreement involving the Anti-Dumping Act, and how that was being
                    administered. There also an was an agreement on something called the wine gallon
                    assessment. Under U.S. law, there was a difference in customs valuation and
                    excise tax valuation on wine as opposed to hard liquor. Just to simplify it,
                    hard liquor was assessed, not on the alcoholic content, but on the volume, so in
                    effect, there was a tax on the water in the whiskey. It was called the “water in
                    the whiskey problem.” The effect of this was that it was cheaper to bottle
                    scotch whiskey in New Jersey than in Scotland. And despite the appeal of water
                    filtered through the heather as opposed to purified New Jersey swamp water,
                    price made a difference. The British were hot on that. There was also an issue
                    involving certification of boilers. You could only sell boilers in the United
                    States under various building codes, that had an ASE, American Society of
                    Engineers, certification. And they just happened not to certify foreign boilers,
                    which meant that you couldn't sell foreign boilers in the United States.</p>
                <p>We took these agreements back to the Congress, and as I explained earlier, the
                    whiskey problem was opposed by a Congressman Watt from Kentucky. He wasn't going
                    to give up on this, so that was turned down. And then Senator Russell Long of
                    Louisiana, Chairman of the Finance Committee, took strong exception to changes
                    in the Anti-Dumping procedures, so he blocked that. These two agreements that
                    had been negotiated ad referendum, were in effect rejected.</p>
                <p>When we began talking about a new negotiation, the question was how are we going
                    to negotiate on non-tariff measures which had become increasingly important? As
                    tariffs came down these other issues loomed much larger. Other countries were
                    saying how do we negotiate with Americans? You can't negotiate unless you have
                    authority, and you're not going to get prior authority for non-tariff
                    measures.</p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>It was coming out of this dilemma that the fast-track process was developed. I
                    always describe fast-track as a process which, first of all, is not fast. It is
                    a process by which the Congress gives the President an authority to negotiate
                    and to bring back an agreement, subject to the requirement that the objectives
                    are set out beforehand in broad terms stated in the legislation. The
                    Administration must consult very closely throughout the process of the
                    negotiation, so the Congress is aware of what is happening, and has an
                    opportunity to express its views. If that procedure is followed, then when the
                    agreement comes back to the Congress, the Congress will take it up under a fixed
                    timetable and will render a decision yes or no, and will not amend the
                    agreement. And that was developed in the 1974 Trade Act, and was used for the
                    new negotiations which became the Tokyo Round. This issue of fast-track has
                    become critical to the conduct of trade negotiations.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, I thought it would never work, that the Congress could never be
                    held to its own rules. For separate reasons, I recommended that the 1974 trade
                    bill be vetoed. Among other things it had in there, which we are still wrestling
                    with, was the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, which denied Most Favored Nation
                    treatment to the Soviet Union, and to other communist countries unless they
                    pursued immigration policy that was satisfactory to the United States. It had
                    other provisions in the Trade Act which I felt were very negative, but anyway my
                    advice was rejected, and perhaps rightly so, but I thought at the time it was a
                    bad trade bill.</p>
                <p>The Tokyo Round negotiations were then initiated. These rounds had different
                    names. Sometimes they referred to people, like the Dillon Round, after Under
                    Secretary Dillon; the Kennedy Round, so named after the assassination. Sometimes
                    they were geographic and the Tokyo Round was so named because that's where the
                    ministerial meeting was held that launched the negotiations. They started in
                    1975. Nothing very much happened for several years, and I really wasn't very
                    much involved at first because I was not primarily involved in trade policy at
                    the time, but rather in resources, commodities. But I had become the Senior
                    Deputy in 1974, I guess, so that I had oversight over everything that happened
                    in the Bureau. So I became again a little more involved in trade policy, but
                    still didn't really get involved in the negotiations. The Deputy Assistant for
                    Trade Policy was more closely involved. But then when the Carter Administration
                    came in, and Robert Strauss became the United States Trade Representative -
                    incidentally, in the '74 Act the STR became the USTR, the Special Trade
                    Representative became the United States Trade Representative and was given
                    Cabinet rank.</p>
                <p>Carter appointed Bob Strauss as USTR and Bob Strauss took over the negotiations
                    and he said, “First thing we're going to do is we're going to get these
                    negotiations started. For the last two years the only thing that's happened in
                    Geneva is that people have learned to ski, and drink European wines.” He asked
                    me to become his Deputy at that time and to go to Geneva, and conduct the
                    negotiations. I declined to do that, because I had a mild heart attack in 1974,
                    and I had actually retired in 1975, although I didn't get to leave.</p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>Joe Greenwald by then had become Assistant Secretary and asked me to stay on for
                    several months to help him get started. This kept dragging and dragging and in
                    the spring I said I'd been here almost 9 months, longer than I intended to be,
                    and it's time for me to go. He said, “I can't talk to you about it now. We'll
                    talk about it when I come back from the trip (he was about to take).” He came
                    back and said “O.K., now I'm prepared to talk to you about it. I'm leaving; I'm
                    resigning.” And I said, “Damn it, that's what I was afraid would happen, and
                    then I'd get stuck again. But I'm not going to change my mind, I'm going to
                    leave.” So I was scheduled to leave in July of 1976.</p>
                <p>I then had a call from Larry Eagleburger (assistant to Kissinger) asking whether
                    I would consider staying on as Assistant Secretary. I said, “No, I would not.
                    I'm determined to leave. I've put this off for almost a year now, and I'm
                    leaving.” So it I came down to Thursday night, and I was up on the 7th floor,
                    saying goodbye. I was in Phil Habib's office, saying farewell to him, and his
                    secretary came in and said, “Secretary Kissinger wants to see Mr. Katz.” So I
                    went in there, thinking this was going to be a farewell. He had Bill Rogers, who
                    was the Under Secretary for Economic Affairs in there, and he said to me, “Sit
                    down.” And then he tore into Bill Rogers over some incident, which involved
                    putting quotas on meat. And he said, “How could you do such a stupid thing when
                    the Prime Minister of Australia is about to visit?” I was out of it; I had
                    objected to the action but this was my next-to-last day, so I was just sitting
                    back, somewhat embarrassed by this tirade. And then finally, he said, “I can't
                    spend any more time on this.” And he points to Rogers and said, “You go,” and
                    points to me, “You stay.” Rogers leaves and Kissinger says, “What's this about
                    your leaving?” I said, “Yes, tomorrow is my last day.” He said, “You can't do
                    this now. We only have six months left in office and you can't leave now. Stay
                    until the end of the Administration, or longer if we come back.” I said, “Mr.
                    Secretary, this has been a very painful decision. All of my instincts tell me to
                    leave, and all my emotions keep me here. But I really have decided to go. Let me
                    think about it and talk to my wife overnight.” He said, “Jules, I know exactly
                    how you feel. I feel the same way.” I said I would let him know the next
                    morning.</p>
                <p>Of course, I'd had farewell parties, the Secretary of Agriculture had given a
                    lunch for me. It was really quite embarrassing. Anyway, I went home and talked
                    to my wife. She said, “I knew you wouldn't leave.” I said, “Thanks a lot.”
                    Anyway, so I stayed on. So when Strauss asked me to be his Deputy, I did not
                    feel that I wanted to take on a longer term commitment. I had agreed to stay on
                    for a while with the new team in the State Department and I was in good health,
                    but I did not want to get into the kind of a grind involved in leading a major
                    negotiation in Geneva. So I turned Strauss down.</p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>As it turned out, I stayed for another three years, because there was just one
                    issue after another, including the Tokyo Round, in which I became increasingly
                    involved, not as a direct participant or negotiator, but part of the policy
                    team. In 1978, there was a session in Geneva of the interagency committee at the
                    Under Secretary level, but mostly attended by Assistant Secretaries. That was an
                    effort to bring the negotiations to a conclusion, and there were some key
                    decisions made. The negotiations actually didn't get concluded for almost
                    another year, but that involved a lot of details, so that July 1978 meeting was
                    fairly important. Of course, Strauss was a character. He had a style that was
                    very different from that of a lot of people. He described himself as a “closer.”
                    He said, “All of my life I've been a closer.” And typically he would say, “Look,
                    I don't know anything about this issue, and I don't want to know anything about
                    it. But let me tell you what we've got to do. Here's how we have to bring this
                    deal together.” That was his art and his skill, and he was pretty effective in
                    doing that.</p>
                <p>Another incident that I recall at the time was an incident with Andy Young, who
                    was at the time the United Nations Representative. He happened to be in Geneva
                    at the same time, and there was a dinner one evening, given by our Ambassador
                    there. He was not the Deputy Trade Representative, who also had the rank of
                    ambassador, but he was Ambassador of the Geneva Mission, which did almost
                    everything except trade. It did refugees and United Nations activities, and Andy
                    was there for some purpose. This was my first real meeting with him, and I found
                    him a very engaging person, although slightly naive.</p>
                <p>One of the subjects that came up at the dinner was the discussion of something
                    called the Common Fund, which was an idea which was developed in UNCTAD to
                    finance buffer stocks for international commodity agreements, something that I
                    had been deeply involved with. And it was simply a nutty idea, a terrible idea.
                    Commodity agreements themselves are basically a bad idea, although I had been
                    involved with coffee, tin, and some wheat agreements, and tried to make them
                    work, but like all cartels, they had limited life and limited usefulness. And
                    buffer stocks would involve an expenditure of large amounts of money to support
                    prices in defiance of rules of gravity, which affect commodity markets. At the
                    G-7 Economic Summit, which had taken place in London a month or so earlier,
                    Carter had finally succumbed to the pleas of the other G-7 heads of government,
                    saying the United States, which had long opposed this would support it subject
                    to certain conditions, which assured that it wouldn't happen.</p>
                <p>Why were we opposed to the Common Fund, asked Young. We had a lot of arguments
                    about that even back under Kissinger, who liked the idea for political reasons.
                    Dick Cooper and I had talked about it. Dick was the Under Secretary, and he and
                    I pretty much agreed and opposed the idea, but finally Carter succumbed. But,
                    Andy Young raised the subject at the dinner asking, “Why do you all object to
                    the Common Fund?” I said, “Because it's a bad idea.” Fred Bergsten, who was
                    Assistant Secretary of Treasury, was also present at the dinner, and he and I
                    together pretty much blasted this idea. Well, among the other objections to it
                    was that it was distracting attention from more constructive ideas that UNCTAD
                    ought to be pursuing; they were just wasting a whole lot of time on this idea
                    which was never going to happen anyway.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>Andy then said, “Well, gee, well then why did we agree to do this?” And we all
                    sort of looked at each other and smiled and made it clear that the President got
                    suckered into to supporting it for political reasons. Andy said, “You've
                    convinced me it's a bad idea, and that we shouldn't be supporting it. I'm going
                    to talk to the Secretary General of UNCTAD.” And the Ambassador, who I believe
                    was named Vanden Heuvel, was apoplectic. He said, “You can't do that; this has
                    already been agreed to.” Andy replied, “No, if it's a bad idea, then I think we
                    ought to scrap it.” Fred and I were very amused by this, we thought this was
                    pretty funny. The next day I saw the Ambassador, and he said, “You know, Andy is
                    serious about this, he's asked for an appointment with the Secretary General.” I
                    said, “Don't worry about it, nothing's going to happen.”</p>
                <p>As it turned out, the appointment never took place, because the next day Anatoly
                    Sharansky, one of the leading Jewish dissidents in the Soviet Union was
                    rearrested and this produced a very strong reaction by the United States
                    Government and the President. Andy Young was asked about this and replied,
                    “Well, we have more political prisoners in the United States than there are in
                    the Soviet Union.” I heard about this at about 8 o'clock that night, when
                    Strauss had convened a meeting. We had all gathered in the U.S. Mission, and he
                    said, “Have you heard what that crazy bastard Andy Young did?” He described what
                    Any had said and said, “I just talked to Carter and I told him to fire his ass
                    out of there.” Well, that was the end of Andy Young, but as I say, it was
                    unfortunate, because I really liked him, I thought he was a very decent person,
                    but somewhat naive, and spoke what came to his mind.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, when we met at 8 o'clock, that was the beginning of an all-night
                    meeting, which is what it normally takes to break the back of a difficult
                    negotiation, and it was one of several, although it took some months after that
                    to actually write the agreement, and get it into force. So that took it into
                    1979, which was pretty much the time when I was leaving.</p>
                <p>Another incident occurred at that time. As part of the implementing legislation
                    for the Tokyo Round, there also developed a major reorganization of the foreign
                    economic functions within the government, and this involved the transfer of a
                    lot of economic functions from the State Department. First of all, the Foreign
                    Commercial Service was transferred to the Commerce Department, and a number of
                    other functions were transferred to an expanded USTR, including commodity
                    policy, and investment policy. In June I had announced that I was going to
                    resign and then again, for various reasons, it kept getting stalled, month by
                    month.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>I thought that the reorganization plan was a very bad idea, that it would really
                    gut the State Department role, which was important from a foreign policy point
                    of view, but also it would dissipate a very strong resource in the government.
                    At the time, the Economic Bureau was really at a peak in effectiveness. I had
                    five deputies who were just outstanding, all of whom went on to other important
                    posts. Steve Bosworth, was my Energy Deputy, and went on among other posts, to
                    be Ambassador to the Philippines at the time of the Marcos affair. Paul Boeker,
                    my Senior Deputy became Ambassador to several countries, including, Chile and
                    Jordan. Bill Barraclough, who unfortunately retired from the service early,
                    certainly would have been an Ambassador. Mike Glitman, became Ambassador to
                    Belgium. It was just an extremely strong Bureau.</p>
                <p>I fought this up through Vance, with support from Dick Cooper, but we were not
                    supported by either Vance or Christopher. Their reactions were like a wet
                    noodle. So the reorganization did take place. I was leaving, so this was not
                    personal on my part, I just thought it was a bad idea. In any event, what
                    happened was that the Economic Bureau of the Department went into a period of
                    decline in the 1980s. There were several commissions convened subsequently to
                    try to reinvigorate the economic role of the State Department, but it has never
                    really been the same.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we stop at this point. The next time we pick
                        this up we'll pick up after your retirement, your reentry into the foreign
                        affairs field, and I'd like to talk a little more about how you saw the
                        fighting over the demise almost of parts of the Economic Bureau. I think we
                        might talk a little more about that next time.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is August 9, 1995. Can you talk a bit about the
                        Economic Bureau. Some things happened to it. What period was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: This was 1979, and it coincided with the end of the Tokyo Round trade
                    negotiations. There is something about organization of government, in
                    particular, that fascinates people, and especially members of Congress. They
                    always think they can shape it in some way that will make it better or more
                    suitable to their interests. I'm not sure exactly what precipitated this, but
                    there had long been a tension about the role of the State Department,
                    particularly in respect to trade relations, going back to the '50 and '60s, and,
                    as I have mentioned earlier, the lead responsibility and policy coordination
                    role had alternated between Commerce and State. And then finally in 1962, in the
                    Trade Expansion Act, Wilbur Mills created the Office of the Special Trade
                    Representative. Incidentally, the person who claims to have come up with the
                    idea, Mike Rashish, who unfortunately just passed on several months ago, was
                    working then for Wilbur Mills.</p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>The STR system worked well, I thought. The STR was a very small organization in
                    the White House, which gave it a position somewhat above the agencies. But in
                    fact a large part of its role was met by detailees, primarily from the State
                    Department and Commerce. We in State provided a lot of the personnel and
                    remained very close and worked hand in glove with STR. And the role of STR was
                    rather limited, specifically to trade relations. In 1979, the idea developed, I
                    think probably somewhat stimulated by people in STR itself, that the role should
                    be expanded and for example, commodity policy, which had always been the
                    province of the State Department, should be transferred to STR, and STR should
                    be given a role with respect to investment policy, which had always been the
                    preserve of the State Department, particularly in the negotiation of Friendship,
                    Commerce and Navigation treaties, and then a little later, of bilateral
                    investment treaties, so-called BITs. And so this gave rise to a big study by
                    OMB, which I think was probably cooked from the beginning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Often these are, aren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes, frequently they are. There was a vigorous argument about this and I
                    tried to forestall it. Primarily because I thought we had a unique resource in
                    the State Department, and as I said a highly effective Bureau. I argued with OMB
                    and with Strauss, and then ultimately I went to Vance and Christopher, and got
                    very little support. Vance and Christopher, I might say, were the weakest
                    Secretaries and Deputy Secretaries in my experience. I will say I am not
                    surprised by Mr. Christopher's weak performance as Secretary of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The work you've done was pretty much in the negotiating
                        legal field. Both these men earned and still are earning — they are
                        considered prime negotiators, legal people, and all that. Is there something
                        inherent in that for leadership.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: No, not at all. In my hierarchy of effective senior government officials,
                    from outside the government, I rank lawyers second after investment bankers. So
                    there's nothing inherent in lawyers. I think it's partly personality, and I will
                    say that Vance probably had stronger personal feelings about policy than did
                    Christopher. But I think his priorities were elsewhere. I think he did not rank
                    economic policy very high. I may have covered earlier a disagreement I had with
                    Vance on export restrictions for a whole series of other policy reasons,
                    including human rights, and Vance just did not give adequate priority to our
                    economic interests. Intellectually he accepted that it was important. It just
                    didn't rank very high in his order of priority. And with Christopher, even less
                    so. I think Christopher is the kind of lawyer that does what the client
                    wants.</p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>At any event, all of this I think played a role in the decision to remove
                    responsibility from the State Department. The State Department was seen to be
                    unfriendly or unsympathetic to business interests. While I thought that was
                    pretty unfair, given my efforts and that of my Bureau, I will have to admit
                    there were more battles that I lost than I wanted to. I remember taking issue
                    with somebody on the Hill, who made some disparaging remark about the State
                    Department. And the response was, “Oh, we don't mean you, Jules. We mean the
                    rest of the institution.” Clearly, there are other policy interests, and we need
                    to work on these to achieve the most sensible outcome, the greatest gain. But in
                    the case of Vance, and in fact the final word in my argument with him, was when
                    he said, “Well, are you saying we should ignore these other interests?” “No, not
                    at all,” I, replied, “I think it”s the essence of public policy that you have
                    conflicting priorities. That you need to deal with them sensibly; that you
                    shouldn't always come out on the other side of our economic interests. You need
                    to look at each question independently, and come out with some common sense
                    view.”</p>
                <p>The die was cast, however, and Carter made the decision against us. And with Bob
                    Strauss was on the other side of, the battle was probably hopeless. Here was
                    little old me on one side facing Bob Strauss, the ultimate insider,
                    wheeler-dealer. And there were people in the Congress that were involved in this
                    as well. So it all got folded into the legislation, which carried out the Tokyo
                    Round agreements. And incidentally, it passed the Congress by something like 94
                    to 2 in the Senate, and 398 to 3 in the House. I mean, they were overwhelming
                    votes. This was a great tribute to Bob Strauss. Reorganization was just a small
                    part of that. In any event, the battle was lost.</p>
                <p>Now I had already made my decision six month's earlier to leave. In fact, I had
                    retired about four and one half year's earlier. But I was sad to have this
                    happen as I was leaving.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did it hit this team that you had, when they saw this
                        coming?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: It was a blow to the morale of the people. They were pretty down about it,
                    and I, in my farewell, tried to reassure them that in the end people were more
                    important than organization. And that what had put the State Department on top
                    was the excellence of its people, and we were always in there first with the
                    best ideas, and that would carry the institution forward. But that was not to
                    be. And then there were some other unfortunate things that happened later on. My
                    successor was Dean Hinton, who was an outstanding, very distinguished foreign
                    service officer, who, I think, held more ambassadorial posts than anyone that I
                    know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And very difficult ones. He was basically one of the top
                        trouble-shooters, he and Tom Pickering.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>KATZ: That's right. Dean did not want to take this job. He didn't want to come
                    back to Washington. His wife was dying of cancer; it was a severe imposition. I
                    said, “Why not just say no?” And he said, “I can't do that, I've never rejected
                    an assignment.” And that was Dean's philosophy. He was an Army brat, and you do
                    what you're told, and you go where you are told to go. What happened
                    subsequently was not Dean's fault, but I think that, together with the
                    reorganization contributed to the decline of the Bureau. When the Reagan
                    administration came in I thought there were excellent appointments: Bob Hormats
                    was made Assistant Secretary. He had been my deputy and Mike Rashish, who I
                    mentioned earlier in connection with the creation of STR, was made Under
                    Secretary. And that proved to be an unfortunate combination because there was a
                    clash between them, and there needs to be close cooperation and coordination
                    between those two positions and people. But it became competitive, and the
                    Bureau suffered further.</p>
                <p>Subsequently, as I said, there were several commissions that were created to try
                    to invigorate the Economic cone in the State Department, of which the Economic
                    Bureau was the core, but they all failed, and the Bureau and the economic cone
                    continued to run down. Typically these commissions would recommend that we
                    needed to do something about recruitment, that we needed more Ph.D. economists.
                    I always thought that was kind of silly, not because I was not a Pd.D.
                    economist, but we didn't need academics, we needed people with policy instincts
                    and good bureaucratic skills, good negotiating skills, not people who could do
                    economic modeling or econometric analysis.</p>
                <p>There were some things that were happening in the world and the economy which
                    impacted the situation. Because the rapidly growing integration of the world
                    economy, the conduct of our foreign economic policy was changing. The linkages
                    were not so much at the State Department or Foreign Office level, as between the
                    Treasuries and the Trade Ministries, and the Agriculture Ministries. As I said
                    earlier, in many cases I had more contact with other members of the U.S. Cabinet
                    than I did with the Secretary of State. So maybe it was time for a change. Maybe
                    the State Department role should have been diminished relative to what it had
                    been before, coming out of World War II and all the efforts to build
                    institutions. Maybe that was appropriate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left in 1979 and before returning to government, could
                        you give us an idea of what you were doing in between?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>KATZ: When I was contemplating leaving the State Department, I had decided that I
                    intended to work, that I wasn't going to lead a life of leisure. But perhaps for
                    misguided ethical reasons, I decided I would not seek a job while I was still
                    employed in the State Department. So when I left on December 15, 1979, I had no
                    idea what I was going to do. But I was quickly contacted by a number of people.
                    I knew what I didn't want to do. I didn't want to work as a consultant in
                    Washington — something I later did, and am doing currently — but I wanted to
                    work for a real company, a real organization. I was contacted by some
                    acquaintances from my commodity days, and I joined a commodity trading company,
                    which was called ACLI, an acronym coming from family names: AC and Leon Israel,
                    whose forefathers were peddlers and importers in Louisiana.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Like Barry Goldwater's grandfather was a peddler.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes, exactly. They traveled up country in Louisiana, but then became
                    importers and imported primarily coffee. And then two of their sons went to New
                    York, and the family split, and there were two different firms. And then 71
                    years later the sons of the sons put the firm together again. In any event, it
                    had become a rather sizeable commodity firm, doing primarily merchant trading,
                    that is, acquiring commodities at source, and then selling them to manufacturers
                    or processors, and that included so-called soft commodities like cocoa, coffee,
                    sugar, but also metals and some other agricultural commodities. And also a
                    subsidiary company, that served as brokers in commodity futures. I was invited
                    to join the company in New York, and I agreed to do so, with not a very clear
                    idea of what I was going to do, except what they were really looking for was
                    management; someone with management experience who knew a little bit about their
                    business. They had grown very rapidly and were weak on the management side.</p>
                <p>So I went up there, and I was kind of undergoing an introductory phase. I'd been
                    there for about 7 weeks, I guess, when the first crisis hit. The silver crisis.
                    Gold and silver prices had zoomed, and then suddenly collapsed in early 1980,
                    and this caused very considerable problems for this futures trading company.
                    They had some customers who defaulted, who were buying futures on margin and
                    couldn't meet their margin payments and ultimately defaulted, leaving the
                    company out something like $36 million, which was about a little less than half
                    the net worth of the company. And so I began spending a lot of time with the
                    subsidiary company and then ultimately became Chairman and for about a year the
                    CEO of this company. The company was later acquired by DLJ, Donaldson, Lufkin
                    and Jenrette. I stayed with them for another 4 years as Chairman of this
                    company. I left there in 1985. They had sold off the merchant trading divisions
                    of the company and decided to move our headquarters from White Plains, New York,
                    which was a tolerable existence for having to live in New York, down to lower
                    Manhattan. I decided that was a lifestyle to which I didn't aspire, and would
                    move back to Washington, which I did in early 1985. I then took off for four
                    months and did some assignments for DLJ which had me on a short-term consultancy
                    arrangement, which was part of the termination package.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>I was then invited to join some former colleagues in a little consulting group.
                    Henry Owen, David Biltchik and Dale Hathaway, all of whom had been colleagues at
                    one time or another, had a small organization. And I stayed with them for little
                    more than a year, and then had a request to join another consulting company,
                    which was involved in a project in which I was particularly interested, and that
                    was the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement.</p>
                <p>This company, called the Government Research Corporation, GRC, had at one time
                    been a subsidiary of The National Journal, or had the same parentage as The
                    National Journal, and then was split off. GRC asked me to come to work on this
                    project. They were doing the policy analysis for a business coalition supporting
                    the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement. That was of considerable interest to me,
                    so I joined them, and did that work. About the same time, actually it was just a
                    little earlier, in 1986, Clayton Yeutter was appointed as the USTR, succeeding
                    Bill Brock.</p>
                <p>I had known Yeutter in the Ford administration, when he was Deputy Special Trade
                    Representative. I also encountered him in my futures trading business, because
                    he had become President of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange. So we had sort of
                    stayed in touch. When he was appointed, he asked me to serve on his transition
                    team in 1986. This was pro bono, not as an employee. And I and two other friends
                    of his looked over the organization, interviewed some of the senior people, and
                    made recommendations to him on organization and people, as well as on some
                    policy issues and helped him with his confirmation testimony. After he took
                    office, he said he would like me to continue to help him on some things. So I
                    was appointed as a consultant to USTR. One of the things I did was to convene a
                    group of people to look at dispute settlement in the GATT, and did a report on
                    that, which formed the basis of U.S. proposals in the Uruguay Round
                    negotiations.</p>
                <p>In 1987, the Uruguay Round negotiations started. It was organized with 15
                    negotiating groups and Yeutter asked me whether I would serve as a chairman of
                    one of the negotiating groups. Most of the chairmen were government officials of
                    various participating countries. But there was at least one other person that I
                    know of, a former Brazilian ambassador, who also served as a chairman in a
                    personal capacity. Well, this interested me, so I readily agreed. So through
                    half of 1987 and 1988, I went to Geneva periodically to chair this group.</p>
                <p>In fact, I was one of two chairmen serving as co-chairman of two negotiating
                    groups. For political reasons, they split the group on Dispute Settlement and
                    Functioning of the GATT system. Lecarte of Uruguay and I were named co-chairmen
                    of the two groups. I actually chaired the initial sessions of both negotiating
                    groups. He was at the time Ambassador to Germany, and then had a brief illness.
                    But then he came back and pretty much stayed with Dispute Settlement, and I
                    stayed with the Functioning of the GATT system, which had the amusing acronym of
                    FOGS. I took a lot of ribbing for that.</p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>The FOGS was a rather interesting group, and it actually had one of the first
                    successes in the negotiations. We produced a system for surveillance of country
                    policies. And it was called the Trade Policy Review Mechanism, and countries'
                    policies are, in effect, audited periodically. The four major countries are
                    reviewed every two years. The next eight largest trading countries are reviewed
                    every four years and then the next sixteen every eight years, and then the rest
                    periodically. This was approved at a so-called mid-term review in the
                    negotiations, which was a ministerial meeting held in Montreal at the end of
                    1988. And it was one of the few solid results to come out of that meeting. I had
                    aggressively pushed the idea, despite resistance of Brazil and India, so I was
                    pretty pleased with that outcome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any problems about how the review would take
                        place?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Oh, yes. It was pretty controversial at the start. In fact, the overall
                    understanding with respect to the negotiations was that the year 1987 would be
                    spent in outlining issues and the presentation of proposals. I kind of swept all
                    of that aside as Chairman. And after the first two meetings, when I had some
                    sense of what people were talking about and what the issues were, and what the
                    interests were, I produced a chairman's paper, a so-called discussion paper.
                    There was opposition from India and Brazil, whose tactics were to slow things
                    down pretty much across the board. After a relatively short period of time, in
                    Geneva negotiating time, I had a paper that was pretty well developed, and
                    aiming toward the mid-term review.</p>
                <p>There were some other issues dealt with by the Fogs. One of the issues which
                    concerned the French for a long time, and still does, concerned what they called
                    international economic coherence. This involved the desirability of attempting
                    to coordinate international economic policy, a noble goal which has never been
                    achieved to any great extent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is this French Cartesian, or something?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: What it goes to is really exchange rates. The French for a long, long time,
                    a couple of decades now, have been very concerned about floating exchange rates,
                    although they were one of the first countries to devalue after the end of World
                    War II and to sort of break the unwritten code. But they have been particularly
                    concerned about the weakness of the dollar which puts them at a competitive
                    disadvantage, and also has presented great difficulties even within the European
                    Community, or now European Union, and making that system work. So they wanted to
                    put a lot of emphasis on coordination between the GATT and the IMF and the World
                    Bank, which is a neat idea, except that what it requires international economic
                    coherence. Of course, first of all you need domestic economic coherence, and we
                    among others, have not enjoyed that for some time. So it's just something that
                    hasn't worked.</p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>Another problem is that the GATT was not an institution in the same sense as the
                    World Bank and the IMF. In fact, the GATT was not truly an institution in a
                    legal sense. The GATT was literally an agreement. It was the General Agreement
                    on Tariffs and Trade, and it was served by a secretariat which was on loan from
                    the Interim Committee for the Havana Charter, going back to 1947. It had no
                    legal standing. It was just some jerry-built organization, with a relatively
                    tiny secretariat. There is no voting system in the GATT. Decisions are taken
                    largely by consensus. So to match the GATT with the other institutions, the IMF
                    and the World Bank, didn't quite work. The other thing is that it is a fact of
                    life that trade ministries in virtually all governments are inferior to finance
                    and treasury ministries.</p>
                <p>That's just the way it is. Normally the Foreign Minister and the Minister of
                    Finance, or the Minister for the Economy, or whatever he is called in a
                    particular country, takes precedence over the Minister of Commerce or the
                    Minister of Trade. And so, it was not, to borrow a phrase, a level playing field
                    internationally with respect to these financial institutions and the GATT. So
                    that was an issue that we had to kind of finesse.</p>
                <p>The other thing, I had tried also to create something which was in effect an
                    executive committee for the GATT. The GATT operated through a Council, which was
                    theoretically all of the members, all of the contracting parties were members of
                    the Council, although somewhere between 40 and 60 showed up at any one time.
                    That was a rather unwielding decision making body. The ministerial meetings were
                    held very rarely. But there was great resistance to that idea, primarily again,
                    from Brazil and India.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was motivating Brazil and India to resist and slow
                        down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Well, if I had to put a word on it, I'd say protectionism. I think two
                    things: first of all, domestic protectionism, but secondly, they wanted to
                    maintain the distinction between developed and developing countries. And they
                    knew that the result of this negotiation would be to put a lot of pressure on
                    particularly advanced developing countries to open their economies. They were
                    just laggards in this international sweeping movement to open markets and open
                    economies. At any event, this idea of an executive committee, or small policy
                    group as I called it — I tried to avoid giving it a title — was something that
                    really stuck in their craw. They equated it to the Security Council in the U.N.,
                    with the large powers having a veto, and they said no security council. I said
                    it was not a security council - it has no executive powers. It is an aid to the
                    director general. So that didn't wash, but the TPRM, Trade Policy Review
                    Mechanism, did survive, and that was a solid achievement.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On your work with this Government Research Corporation, I
                        note that you were working for the Canada-U.S. Free Trade Agreement. You're
                        sitting in a different place now. And Canada has always, as we've talked
                        about before, its own motivations and all that. Did you find sitting outside
                        the government working for something like this; how did you find dealing
                        with the Canadian-American relations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Well, it was frustrating. Working in the government is frequently
                    frustrating, but being on the outside is even more frustrating in a sense,
                    because you can't really control or influence events or outcomes. My role was
                    primarily to follow the negotiations and the issues, and to keep this business
                    coalition informed of what was going on, but not to interfere in the
                    negotiations. That is, the business group had decided early on that it wanted to
                    be supporters, and was interested, obviously, in the outcome of particular
                    issues, but did not want to be a negotiating party. And given my proclivities
                    for activism, I had to restrain myself. I would express opinions, but mostly
                    privately, and didn't really try to influence the content of the
                    negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way, was this protectionists versus free traders, or
                        nationalists versus internationalists? Were these the motivations in the
                        negotiations?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: No. Not at all. I think it was somewhat different. There was general
                    agreement, and fairly wide support for free trade with Canada. But there were
                    specific issues which derived from national approaches. For example, we
                    frequently charged that the Canadians had a propensity to subsidize their
                    industries. In truth, we both subsidized, but we did it differently. The
                    Canadians used the federal budget to a greater extent than we did, and we did a
                    lot more through states, things like tax forgiveness, or building infrastructure
                    in order to attract industry.</p>
                <p>There were differences on how to approach anti-dumping, that was a big issue in
                    the negotiation. A major issue with Canada is culture, the concern about
                    maintaining a separate identity. In fact, before the negotiations ever started.
                    Right on the eve of the negotiations, there was a dinner in Washington attended
                    by a lot of Canadian officials and former Canadian officials, people I had
                    known. Clayton Yeutter gave a speech and he was asked a question about how are
                    you going to handle the cultural issue. And his response was “I don't see this
                    as a problem at all. We have great respect for Canadian culture; my wife and I
                    honeymooned at Niagara Falls.” I was sitting at the table with Jake Warren, who
                    was a former Deputy Minister in several departments in the Canadian government,
                    and the former Ambassador to the United States. He threw up his hands and he
                    said, “My God, you Americans will just never understand us.” And sure enough,
                    the next day, there were screaming headlines in Canada, “Yeutter Understands
                    Canadian Culture: Niagara Falls.”</p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>There were other issues, such as the old auto agreement. The U.S. team I thought
                    somewhat foolishly started out saying the auto agreement had to go as part of
                    the free trade agreement. That produced a big flap. And I thought it was silly
                    because it was not an issue worth talking about. The provisions of the auto
                    agreement people were concerned about no longer had much economic effect,
                    particularly with an overall free trade agreement. The issue was form over
                    substance.</p>
                <p>There were also problems in negotiating style. The Canadian negotiator was Simon
                    Reisman, who as I related earlier was rather formidable, very dynamic. As he
                    aged he became more convinced of his positions, and on the other side, Peter
                    Murphy, U.S. negotiator, was a lot less senior in stature. He had been a Deputy
                    USTR Ambassador in Geneva, but that wasn't so much the problem. His style was
                    just very different. He had a dour personality and was very defensive in his
                    approach. One of his favorite expressions was that “We are not demandeur in this
                    negotiation.” In other words, all of the proposals had to come from the Canadian
                    side, which kind of drove the Canadians crazy. Simon passed a story around in
                    Canada, which is I think untrue, and that is that I was to have been the
                    negotiator, and if he and I had been on opposite sides it would have been a
                    different negotiation. Well, I don't think the story was true. I was not in the
                    government, I had no intention of returning to the government, I was very happy
                    to be on the outside.</p>
                <p>In any case, the outcome overall was an outstanding achievement. There were some
                    things I wish had come out differently, but that would be true of any
                    negotiation and I'm not sure that had I been doing it the outcome would have
                    been very different. But then when the negotiations were concluded, I produced
                    an analysis which was used by the coalition, and produced some other materials
                    that was used in the lobbying effort.</p>
                <p>The result of all of this work kind of got me back into the trade policy
                    arena.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Couldn't get away from the tar baby...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: So to speak. I was identified in town with the subject. Then in early 1989,
                    one afternoon, I received a call from Carla Hills, who I never actually knew. I
                    was in the Roosevelt Room with her on more than one occasion in the Ford
                    administration - she was Secretary of Housing. But I had no contact with her. I
                    had known her husband, who was White House Counsel for a time, and had one brief
                    meeting with him after we had both departed from the Government. He had called
                    me about an issue in 1980 or 1981. Anyway, she called, and said “Would you mind
                    coming around to talk to me about trade policy?” And so I went over to her
                    office. She was in a law firm at the time. I went to visit her, and we talked
                    for about a half an hour about various issues, the negotiations which were under
                    way in the Uruguay Round. And then she said, “Well, I won't beat around the
                    bush, will you be my Deputy?” And I said, “I don”t know, let me think about it.
                    It's not something I had planned on.”</p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>The offer came at a moment that left me somewhat vulnerable, because my company,
                    GRC, actually well the parent of my company had been acquired by a British
                    company, which also owned another company in Washington called Hill and
                    Knowlton. They decided to merge GRC and Hill and Knowlton, and I had pretty well
                    decided that I would not join that merged company. They had made a seemingly
                    extravagant offer to me to assume the position of worldwide practice director
                    for international trade for Hill and Knowlton, which had something like 28
                    international offices, and offices throughout the United States. It sounded
                    wonderful, but as I spoke with various people what I discovered was that there
                    was not a whole lot of substance to this; that all of the people that worked
                    there were really kind of independent entrepreneurs, there was no real
                    organization, everybody had his own accounts. I recommended someone else for the
                    job, and he did not hold me responsible, but he discovered after about a year
                    what I had discovered in a matter of about 10 days, and subsequently left.</p>
                <p>So I was sort of at loose ends at the time. After consulting with my wife I
                    decided to accept Carla Hills's offer. One of the other reasons I decided to do
                    it was that USTR had developed into a very fine organization. Very small, but
                    very professional. But there was no one at a senior level with experience that
                    could move into this position. Mike Smith, who has held this position, had
                    retired six or eight months earlier. There was no one there in a senior position
                    who could take this on, and I just thought there was a need. Anyway, I thought
                    it might be fun to do this for two years. The assumption was that the
                    negotiations would end at the end of 1990.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What negotiations are we talking about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: This is the Uruguay Round trade negotiations. Well, it actually turned out
                    to be more than I bargained for, because the negotiations filled the four years
                    of our term. We brought them almost to a conclusion, but we could never quite
                    conclude them. That was done a year after the Clinton administration came into
                    office, although most of the issues had already been decided. There was even a
                    text of an agreement. But the other thing that happened, of course, was the
                    NAFTA negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: NAFTA being ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: The North American Free Trade Agreement. I think we ought to divide it at
                    this point into the two major negotiations, and take them separately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we do that, I wonder if you could talk — Carla
                        Hills is one of the dynamic people in Washington. Could you discuss your
                        experience with her as how she ran things; her method of operation?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>KATZ: Well, as I said, I had not really known her earlier, except by reputation.
                    She was a very bright, able woman, who had a career as a lawyer, as well as a
                    government official. She had been a U.S. Attorney, and then Assistant Attorney
                    General in the Ford Administration, and the became Secretary of Housing and then
                    back into a law practice. Like a lot of lawyers, she's very hands on. Delegating
                    does not come easy. At USTR, it was necessary that she do so. She could not
                    handle all of the issues, so she had to delegate.</p>
                <p>There were two Deputies in Washington, one in Geneva. In addition to the Uruguay
                    Round negotiations, there were a host of other issues the USTR had to deal with.
                    Japan was a major preoccupation, as well as a host of other bilateral
                    negotiations with other countries. Intellectual property negotiations, with
                    Korea, Brazil, Argentina, Chile, Mexico. Trade barrier negotiations with Korea,
                    Brazil, India and others. Bilateral issues with the European Community — so
                    there were a great many things. The way we divided up was that I would have
                    responsibility for multilateral affairs, multilateral negotiations, Western
                    Hemisphere and Europe. My colleague Linn Williams had responsibility for
                    bilateral issues with Asia, which involved mostly Japan, but Korea to some
                    extent, and China, which was also a major issue. There were a number of major
                    issues with China. And there were some multilateral issues, primarily of a
                    sectoral character, such as international steel agreement, international
                    shipping agreement, for which Linn had primary responsibility. But the
                    relationship evolved. Without having been named as such, I served in fact as the
                    Senior Deputy, and my working relationship with Carla became very good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From what you saw, much of this was, of course,
                        negotiating. What was her style of negotiation. Was it different from
                        your's, would you say?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>KATZ: Yes. She tends to be very intense, with very thorough preparation. She will
                    study briefing books, underline just about every line. There was an experience
                    which was kind of illustrative, and somewhat amusing. From time to time there
                    would be a meeting of a number of trade ministers, somewhere between 15 and 20
                    ministers. And we met in Mexico, at Puerto Vallarta. We met there for three
                    days, and following that meeting, we had to meet with the Ways and Means
                    Committee at a retreat in North Carolina. The only fast way to get from there
                    was on a chartered jet. We had an Air Force executive jet take us from Puerto
                    Vallarta to Winston-Salem. And also appearing at this retreat, this Ways and
                    Means Committee retreat, was the European Commissioner for Trade, Franz
                    Andriessen. So we were crowded in this little jet. We boarded the aircraft at
                    about 6 or 7 o'clock at night, and Andriessen and his wife, sitting in the back,
                    and then Carla and myself, and two other USTR people in very cramped quarters.
                    We had a picnic supper and then immediately Carla whipped out the briefing book
                    for the meeting with the Ways and Means Committee and the other USTR people did
                    as well, going through the briefing book and answering her questions. And Mrs.
                    Andriessen, sitting in the back, just couldn't believe this. She said, “My God,
                    I don't understand you people. You've just come from a meeting, don't you ever
                    stop?” And the answer to that was no. Mrs. Andriessen's husband, Franz was, of
                    course, known for his lack of preparation.</p>
                <p>And Carla generally worked 6 and 7 days a week. I had developed a practice in my
                    last years at the State Department that as a general rule I would only work five
                    days. I would work 60 hours a week, but spread over 5 days, and would try to
                    leave myself two days for regeneration. And I pretty much held to that. I would
                    come in on Saturdays only if there was a meeting that I had to attend. But
                    generally I tried to stay out of the office. But she was just in there all the
                    time.</p>
                <p>In terms of negotiating style, she was extremely intense. She came across as
                    being very hard. She got a lot of bad press initially. In fact, we used to tease
                    her, we'd call her the “wicked witch of the West.” And she was unrelenting. Some
                    people took it badly, but in time she was greatly admired for her abilities and
                    her intellect, so she was a winner, and when people became accustomed to her
                    style, they accepted her as an important player and one of the most effective
                    members of the Bush Cabinet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It just occurred to me, did you ever play
                        good-cop/bad-cop. In other words, you would say, “Well, if we can't reach an
                        agreement on this, I”ll have to sic Carla on you.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Well, no, not consciously. It wasn't that so much. Of course, negotiations
                    would take place at different levels. But, frequently, we would sit there
                    together. She, despite being very hands-on, was very generous and sharing of
                    both credit and blame. But, sitting in a meeting, she would turn to me and, if I
                    had something to say, I could speak up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which one negotiation do you want to do first?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0089" n="Page0089"/>
                <p>KATZ: Let's do the Uruguay Round. This was a negotiation of enormous scope and
                    complexity. There were a great many issues and over 100 countries participating.
                    Many of the issues were novel in the sense that they had not confronted
                    multilaterally before. Services were extremely difficult because that was a new
                    issue and there was a problem in conceptualizing what this agreement would look
                    like. No one knew what trade in services...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Services as defined, meant what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Well, it is illustrated by things such as lawyering, accountancy,
                    engineering, advertising, banking, transportation, telecommunications, etc.
                    There is no problem with dealing with an agreement on goods. You lower your
                    tariffs by x percent the following list of goods, and I'll lower my tariffs by x
                    percent on the following list of goods. And you can put monetary value on the
                    results. But the problem in services involved mostly regulation, licensing
                    requirements, all kinds of barriers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're up against guilds, almost.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes exactly. Many of the restrictions in fact had their origin in guilds.
                    So, it was extremely difficult first to conceptualize how you would deal with
                    things that were hard to quantify. How do you trade-off lowering barriers in
                    financial services for telecommunications? And then there was the problem of
                    these deep seated differences in practice and protectionism. Other countries
                    didn't want American insurance companies coming there. Financial services, of
                    course was another big issue. We were very resistant to including maritime
                    services, and aviation, both with politically potent supporters in the Congress.
                    So there was kind of a broad, overarching problem of how to construct the
                    agreement and then a great many problems on specific service areas.</p>
                <p>The other problem was that developing countries said, well, if we're going to
                    talk about services, then we must talk about labor services; labor as a service.
                    And they wanted to include that. It was also an issue that came up in the NAFTA
                    negotiations, and I said to the Mexicans, “when you're talking about labor
                    services, you're talking about more than just trade. You're getting into things
                    like social policies, social security, unemployment, housing — you're getting
                    far beyond trade.”</p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>The overriding issue that kept the negotiations going so long was the issue of
                    agriculture. It is also the issue on which I spent the most time. I think it may
                    be useful, first, to go back a bit, and put it in a historical perspective.
                    Agriculture was a major issue in this negotiation from the very beginning, and
                    it was an major issue in the sense of the need for reform of the agricultural
                    trading rules. And that became the primary objective of the United States, as
                    well as a number of other countries.</p>
                <p>It is somewhat ironic, that reform became such an important issue for the U.S.
                    because it was the U.S. that was largely responsible for the poor state of
                    agriculture rules in the first place. The U.S., with some other countries,
                    insisted on carving out exceptions for agriculture at the time the GATT was
                    negotiated in 1947. So that whereas subsidies, export subsidies in particular,
                    were generally condemned in the GATT, there was an exception for agriculture and
                    for primary products. Countries like Australia wanted exceptions for things like
                    minerals. Similarly, import quotas, quantitative restrictions, are generally
                    prohibited. Again, there was an exception for agriculture.</p>
                <p>By the late 1950s, at the time of the so-called Dillon Round, named after Douglas
                    Dillon, who had been Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, later Under
                    Secretary, and then Secretary of the Treasury, there was growing concern about
                    agricultural policy, because the European Common Market was beginning to take
                    form, and in particular, a common agricultural policy, the CAP, was being
                    developed, which was highly protectionist. So there were negotiations in 1960
                    and 1961, and interestingly, one of the things that came out of that was a
                    so-called zero binding on soybeans, that is, the EC agreed that their duty on
                    soybeans would be at zero. In GATT parlance, those are called bindings. That
                    turned out to be an enormously valuable concession for the United States, both
                    for the amount of trade that we conducted in soybeans over the course of a
                    couple of decades, but also because of the leverage it gave us in later
                    negotiations.</p>
                <p>The Kennedy Round came immediately after that, in 1963, and already there were
                    serious problems in the negotiations. There was a major fracas over the EC's
                    variable levy, which was a kind of infernal machine. Instead of having a fixed
                    tariff, the tariff was set almost on a daily basis to equate to the domestic
                    price. So it could be almost an infinite trade barrier. And then to add insult
                    to injury, the proceeds of that variable levy were used to finance export
                    subsidies. So we got it coming and going, as it were. That issue was never
                    resolved in the Kennedy Round.</p>
                <p>There were some agreements reached, such as an international grains agreement,
                    primarily a price agreement, that was signed which fell apart even before it
                    came into existence. As all cartels normally fail over time, this one failed
                    even before its time. The thieves fell out, as it were, as people began to cheat
                    on price differentials and transportation differentials. There were an infinite
                    numbers of ways to cheat, and that was done, by all parties incidentally. The
                    U.S. complained the loudest, but the even U.S. was not without guilt.</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>Next came the Tokyo Round negotiations, and now we were beginning to get serious,
                    and said this time we were really going to fix agriculture. And again, there
                    were a series of agreements reached. We had somewhat soured by that time, on
                    commodity agreements. The Europeans and other countries thought that was the
                    answer to agriculture problems, since if you couldn't have free markets in
                    agriculture, you ought to organize them. You ought to make them more rational
                    than they are. The disillusionment with trying to fix markets hadn't spread
                    throughout the world quite yet. So what we ended up with in the Tokyo Round was
                    a series of commodity “understandings.” They were not full-blown commodity
                    agreements. There was an agreement on dairy, for example, that the U.S. opted
                    out of. But there was some general language on agricultural subsidies which
                    proved to be ineffective.</p>
                <p>And then there was something called a “cathedral.” It was an overarching
                    statement of principles, and in negotiating parlance, it would have been called
                    a “chapeau” but when I came up with this idea in a meeting in Copenhagen in
                    1978, I believe, I said what we needed was something to cover these individual
                    agreements — we had to have some overarching principles on agricultural trade.
                    It was just too chaotic and merely having a series of commodity understandings
                    or arrangements wasn't sufficient, and to demonstrate the idea of this
                    overarching agreement, I brought my hands together. The Director General for
                    Agriculture in Europe, Louis Rabot, who was a wonderful man, now deceased, after
                    someone had said chapeau, He said, “No, a cathedral!” It was pretty much a
                    motherhood statement, and in the end never really accomplished much. It proved
                    to be another disappointment.</p>
                <p>So by the time the Uruguay Round came along in the '80s, the U.S. position was
                    that a major reform of agricultural rules was necessary. I was out of government
                    at that point, but the principal people who were involved, namely Clayton
                    Yeutter, and the Secretary of Agriculture, Dick Lyng, both had very strong
                    agricultural backgrounds. Yeutter was the USTR at that point, and Lyng both had
                    been in the Department of Agriculture in the Nixon administration. Lyng also had
                    been Secretary of Agriculture in California, and very close to Governor Reagan
                    and President Reagan. So, agriculture was really, I would say, an overriding
                    objective of the U.S. at that point, along with certain other things, such as
                    the new issues, services and intellectual property. In trying to get the
                    negotiation organized, agriculture was a major issue from the very beginning,
                    and it almost resulted in preventing the negotiations from even being initiated
                    at Punta del Este. It was argued vociferously and then finally some form of
                    words, a declaration, was negotiated which permitted the negotiations to get
                    under way.</p>
                <p>In mid-1988, the Reagan Administration made a very dramatic proposal — that all
                    agricultural subsidies be eliminated by the end of the century. The Europeans
                    thought that the proposal was outrageous, nothing more than a grandstand play.
                    What it did, however, was to focus the issue in a very effective way. Work done
                    in the OECD to estimate the cost of government subsidies showed more than $100
                    billion dollars was being spent in the world. The EC and the U.S. at the time
                    accounted for well more than half of the total.</p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>The proposal remained very controversial even as the U.S. began to modify it,
                    stretching out the phase out period. Some thought that the proposal set back the
                    negotiations, because European farmers thought it too threatening.</p>
                <p>Then at the end of 1988, at the so-called mid-term review, agriculture caused a
                    real crisis. In one sense, these negotiations were surrounded by a certain
                    amount of naivete, in that here we were taking on extremely difficult issues,
                    and novel issues never before negotiated internationally, such as services, or
                    negotiated in connection with trade agreements, such as intellectual property.
                    But to boot, Yeutter decided that we were going to do all of this in four years.
                    The two previous negotiations went for five years. And then the idea was that
                    half way through there would be what turned out not only a mid-term review, but
                    it was even called an early harvest. The idea was that agreements would be
                    reached half-way through and put in the bank, as it were, and then to go on and
                    negotiate the rest of them. As it turned out, the only agreement reached was the
                    Trade Policy Review Mechanism I had negotiated through my FOGS group.</p>
                <p>But Yeutter was determined to get something on agriculture, negotiations on which
                    hadn't really gotten under way. My efforts to get agreements in the FOGS group,
                    had met a lot of resistance from a number of countries, saying, hey, you're not
                    supposed to be doing this in the first two years; you're supposed to just be
                    receiving proposals and discussing proposals, and not driving for agreement. But
                    in agriculture, nothing really had been accomplished. So when they went to
                    Montreal, agriculture became a major stumbling block. They couldn't even agree
                    on what would be negotiated. So it almost resulted in a collapse of the
                    negotiations.</p>
                <p>Finally the other issues in the negotiations were dealt with, and agriculture was
                    set aside. And then in March there was a ministerial meeting in Geneva, although
                    we were not represented at the ministerial level. A change in the administration
                    had taken place. The Bush administration had come in and Carla Hills was now the
                    USTR. I had not yet taken office, although I was on board as a consultant. I was
                    caught up in the ugly appointive process, which has gotten worse with each new
                    Administration. This story is worth a slight digression.</p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>Carla first asked me to join her in early January. I did not take office until
                    late-June more than five months later. In retrospect, I thought about the
                    pathology of the Presidential appointment process. The first thing that happens
                    is the press leak. In my case this came in early February. Next is the White
                    House announcement of the intention of the President to nominate. This came in
                    early March. In the intervening period there was the filling out of endless
                    forms, life history and minute financial disclosure, along with the FBI
                    investigation. Following the White House announcement, I took on the status of a
                    consultant, permitting me to sit in on meetings, read papers and receive
                    briefings, but I could not take part in any policy making decisions. The next
                    step was the submission of my nomination to the Senate, but this was held up
                    over an argument with one of the White House lawyers who was insisting that I
                    dispose of a small financial holding that he argued could present a conflict.
                    His position was ridiculous and I got my back up and resisted. Finally I
                    prevailed, the nomination went forward in early June, I was quickly confirmed by
                    the Senate (unanimously) and I took the oath of office on June 26.</p>
                <p>The process is not something I would want to repeat or to recommend to friends.
                    For much of the five month period I was largely immobilized. I sat in my office
                    but could not do anything. At one point I became so frustrated, I drafted a
                    letter to Carla, but did not send, asking her to withdraw my nomination. It was
                    a day or so later when the nomination was announced. This is just a side light
                    on one of the downsides of public service.</p>
                <p>To get back to the story of the agricultural negotiations, an understanding was
                    reached at the March 1989 meeting on how to proceed to negotiate the
                    agricultural issues. We were represented there by Warren Lavorel, who was our
                    coordinator for the Uruguay Round, with the rank of Ambassador. A declaration
                    was agreed upon, which established the terms of reference for the negotiations,
                    and the issues that would be covered, including domestic support or domestic
                    subsidies, export subsidies, market access or the bringing down of trade
                    barriers, and then a number of other agricultural rules. So presumably we were
                    on our way. But then nothing much happened through the rest of 1989. We just
                    couldn't really get the negotiations moving.</p>
                <p>Beginning in 1990, we began getting a little concerned about the delay, because
                    the entire negotiation was scheduled to end in December of 1990. So, starting in
                    January we had a series of meetings between Carla Hills and Franz Andriessen,
                    who was the Commissioner with responsibility for foreign affairs and trade
                    negotiations within his ambit. He had previously been the Commissioner for
                    Agriculture, which seemed to be an useful background, and therefore, one would
                    have thought he would have been exactly the right person to be negotiating with.
                    But he turned out to be a very disappointing counterpart. For one thing, he
                    really did not want to deal with agriculture. The new Commissioner for
                    Agriculture, Ray McSharry, was a black-headed Irishman, extremely combative,
                    very determined, very smart, although not polished. Certainly not what you would
                    expect in a European counterpart, he was very rough around the edges. And it
                    quickly developed that he and Andriessen didn't get along very well.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>Andriessen also really saw himself as the Foreign Minister of the European
                    Community, and so he had a lot of other interests. Of course, Eastern Europe,
                    and the Soviet Union were beginning to crumble, and he spent a lot of time
                    there. He went on trips to the Far East. It turned out, until very late in the
                    negotiations, in October of 1992, that he was almost never prepared for a
                    meeting. And where Carla Hills was over prepared — she would rehearse and
                    rehearse, and go through briefing books, underlining, highlighting every line,
                    Andriessen came to meetings, and sort of had a blank stare on his face.</p>
                <p>Well, starting in January of 1990, we met with him, I think, every month, from
                    then until December, except perhaps, for the month of August. For one reason or
                    another, either we had bilateral consultations, or we had Quad meetings. That
                    is, meetings of the big four meeting, US, EC, Canada and Japan. Or there were
                    other bilateral U.S.-EC meetings. But we had occasion to meet him once a month,
                    and his typical line was, “Well, we can't meet here,” i.e., Washington,
                    Brussels, Canada, or Mexico, or wherever it was — “we had to negotiate in
                    Geneva.” The other line, and where the truth lay is “we can't discuss this now,”
                    because the Community was not ready. The Community did not have a mandate on
                    agriculture.</p>
                <p>So this became an enormously frustrating experience. One of the other things that
                    characterized this negotiation was that the operation of the common agricultural
                    policy requires price decisions in the Spring. They establish their price
                    objectives and issue regulations. This target date is sometime around late May,
                    in order to give farmers notice so that they know what they may plant. But it
                    generally extends into June and sometimes in crisis years into July. So every
                    year, we were confronted with this problem. Well, the Community couldn't talk
                    throughout the Spring, because they were doing their price negotiations. Then
                    came the summer holidays, which ran from the last week of July through the first
                    week of September. Thus, negotiations tended to be compressed in the last three
                    months of the year.</p>
                <p>The other thing that was happening was that the problem of agriculture was
                    becoming much more difficult in Europe and they were growing more and more
                    commodities, foodstuffs mostly, to the point where they couldn't eat it, they
                    couldn't consume it, they couldn't even store it. In fact, they were storing
                    meat in lockers in Hungary because they had run out of storage space in the
                    Community itself. They had huge export subsidies, and that was beginning to run
                    into greater and greater resistance, to say nothing of the growing financial
                    burden.</p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>So it was clear that there was a lot of tension in the Community. Some of this
                    had not become as apparent then as it did later. In any event, we went through
                    half of 1990, with nothing having happened. In July of 1990, we decided that
                    agriculture should be a major issue at the G-7 Economic Summit, which was held
                    in Houston. Typically, USTR didn't get invited to summit meetings. The Secretary
                    of State and the Secretary of the Treasury and their counterparts were the
                    principal ministers in attendance. So there was no room at the table for the
                    USTR or other trade ministers. Bob Strauss, in the '70s, insisted on going to
                    the London summit, and when Carter said, gee I'm sorry, this is Cy Vance and
                    Mike Blumenthal's thing, Strauss said, “Well, Cy can sit out.” He insisted on
                    going and he did get to go. And in fact, I think he probably threatened to
                    resign and Carter yielded. But this was a problem over the years.</p>
                <p>In 1990, we decided to make this an issue. And still Carla Hills was not
                    included, but she was asked to go to Houston, and Yeutter as well. I went along
                    with Carla. So we were in Houston, but we were not part of the proceedings. In
                    fact, we didn't even know what we were doing there. We were in a hotel, remote
                    from the proceedings. Our press officer then found that there was a huge press
                    center, where there was a lot of activity going on. So we went over there, got
                    credentials to permit us to come in there, and we hung out at the White House
                    Press Office. And that was a wonderful place, because there was a tremendous
                    amount of activity going on there, and we picked up little rumors, although
                    nothing having to do with our issue. There were also newspapers from all over
                    the world and fabulous free eating facilities.</p>
                <p>Late one morning, I was wandering around this cavernous convention center and
                    someone came running after me, saying “Carla needs to see you right away.” I
                    went rushing up to the office and was told that Margaret Thatcher, Prime
                    Minister of Great Britain, had just presented some kind of paper to Bush. So we
                    were on the phone with President Bush's entourage. We had it read to us on the
                    phone, and it was terrible. And they said, “What's wrong with it?” We tried to
                    explain it, and they said we had better get over there right away. And the next
                    question was, how could we get over there and how do we get in because we were
                    not credentialed? Well, after a lot of adventure, we finally requisitioned some
                    cars from the Navy which was providing transportation and we got over there.</p>
                <pb facs="0096" n="Page0096"/>
                <p>By the time we got there, the Heads of Government were at lunch, and we were
                    going over the statement, trying to repair it, and it was pretty awful. It
                    turned out, the President had looked at it, and it seemed O.K. to him, so when
                    Thatcher had presented it, he apparently nodded assent. But he came out, and he
                    heard that we were unhappy with it. So he said, “Well, what's wrong with it?” We
                    explained, and he wasn't terribly pleased with that, but being a good soldier,
                    he went back into the meeting and tried to undo it. Well, the arrangements are
                    that very few people are in the room. The Heads of Government, Ministers, and a
                    note taker. And they had a new system there, a computer that you could write on,
                    and then it gets transmitted to another computer, so we had a monitor outside
                    the meeting room, watching this scrawl coming up. Dick McCormack, who was the
                    Under Secretary of State for Economic Affairs, was the Sherpa, the carrier for
                    those that go up to the summit — basically the U.S. coordinator, and also the
                    scribe for the meeting. So we saw this coming over, and people crowding around,
                    saying, “What did he say? Oh my God!”</p>
                <p>Well, in any event, Bush saved the day, and it was then left to officials to deal
                    within the communique. And so that night, I joined the drafters of the
                    communique and we had a terrible time trying to negotiate a statement with the
                    Europeans. The sense of it, the objective, was to provide some agreement which
                    would permit the negotiations to get off of dead center. And finally, at about 4
                    in the morning, we reached agreement, and we thought we had achieved a
                    breakthrough. And we so characterized it to the press, and to the world. There
                    was a funny incident at the press conference, the President's press conference.
                    The Chairman of the Agriculture Negotiating Group was a former Dutch civil
                    servant, Art de Zeeuw and it was a rather difficult pronunciation, (de Zayoo)
                    and his name got bandied about. Now he was important, because before the Summit,
                    he had written a Chairman's proposal, which we thought was pretty good, and it
                    was blasted by the Community, even though of course he was Dutch, and there was
                    a lot of discussion of the de Zeeuw Report, and when in the press conference
                    President Bush referred to the his report and the communique was intended to
                    give some support to this, he referred to the De Jew Report, and one of my
                    colleagues sitting next to me said, “He ain't no Jew, he's Catholic.” But
                    anyway, we got past this, and now we are in July.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to ask a question. Here you have this economic
                        summit, and only the principals are there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Well, plus the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Treasury.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. But the Prime Minister of Great Britain presents a
                        proposal at a meeting. They are all sitting around. Nobody's vetted this
                        before. Was this a fast shuffle, was this just poorly drafted? It sounds
                        kind of dangerous, because anything on the economic side is out of the range
                        of experience of most heads of state. These things can get extremely
                        technical. What a hell of a way to run business; was this a maneuver to put
                        something over, or what was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>KATZ: Well, you're absolutely right. It was very poor procedure. The Brits did
                    try to pull a fast one. It's not just that the issue is technical. As you know,
                    in negotiations words tend to have special meaning. There are terms of art which
                    are not terms that a layman would understand. Even people who were fairly
                    sophisticated in economic policy issues might miss the nuances of a particular
                    issue. Of course, Jim Baker was there, and Nick Brady, the Secretary of the
                    Treasury, but they were not sensitive to the issues at hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Jim Baker had been Secretary of the Treasury.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes, and Jim was fairly knowledgeable, but even he didn't know the nuances.
                    Of course, this was not Thatcher's own idea, it was her officials who put her up
                    to it. I think it was probably a fairly genuine attempt to try to overcome the
                    issues, but I think even these British officials were somewhat not deeply
                    schooled in the issues and the importance of them. In any event, it was a very
                    bad thing to do, and it was unhelpful.</p>
                <p>But, anyway, having this summit communique, which we thought was a breakthrough,
                    we then had Arthur Dunkel, the Director General of the GATT, convene a small
                    meeting in Geneva, late in July, actually at a little house that was Art de
                    Zeeuw's house outside of Geneva. It was his pied-a-terre when he negotiated
                    there. And we were there, we being Dick Crowder, the Under Secretary of
                    Agriculture and me. We had become a team in the agriculture group. And then we
                    were expecting Guy Legras, who was the Director General for Agriculture in the
                    Commission. The idea was we were going to meet at three o'clock and then go
                    through dinner and try to get the negotiation moving. And there were some other
                    Community officials there, Rolf Moeller, who worked for Legras. They came from
                    DG6, the Directorate General for Agriculture. DG1, the Directorate for Foreign
                    Affairs, which had overall negotiating responsibility, was represented by Hugo
                    Paeman. Legras arrived and promptly announced that he had to catch a plane by
                    five o'clock. Now here Crowder and I had flown all the way from the States for
                    this meeting, and were greeted by Legras saying he only had two hours to spend.
                    I was so angry I almost walked out at that point. But we began to spar
                    immediately.</p>
                <p>I neglected to say that Peter Field, from Australia was also there, and Field
                    tended to represent the Cairns Group. The Cairns Group were a group of 13
                    agricultural exporting nations, and were an important factor in the negotiations
                    because they were holding up on other issues important, such as services and
                    intellectual property. So Field was an important player in this as well.</p>
                <pb facs="0098" n="Page0098"/>
                <p>Obviously this meeting got nowhere, and so we lost the summer, and then by
                    October not very much was happening. Finally, and here we are moving toward the
                    conclusion of the negotiations. Other issues in the negotiation were also
                    languishing. There was very little progress being made on services. Virtually
                    nothing on market access, which had to do with tariffs and non-tariff barriers.
                    We came into November, and there was a meeting organized in Geneva, a kind of a
                    rump session of trade ministers. There were some 20-25 trade ministers from
                    various countries, the major countries all being there, to discuss what do we
                    do? Do we go ahead with the concluding meeting scheduled for Brussels in
                    December, or do we call it off? I argued strongly, and Carla Hills agreed, that
                    we should call off the meeting, because we thought that it would be a disaster.
                    There was no way we could conclude the negotiations, because we hadn't even
                    received a proposal from the EC. We had offered in a proposal on agriculture, as
                    had other countries, but nothing had come from the Community, and we had not an
                    hour of serious negotiation, except on the shape of the negotiations, what the
                    issues would be.</p>
                <p>We were joined by the Australians in urging that the Brussels meeting be called
                    off. The Canadians, on the other hand, said we had to go through with the
                    meeting. And they were pressed very hard. John Crosby, who was their Minister of
                    Trade, insisted that we go ahead and meet. And finally, he won the day, because
                    no one had the guts, to actually pull the plug on the concluding conference.</p>
                <p>I was trying to recall the story previously, but I think I remember it now. At a
                    luncheon at the Canadian Ambassador's residence, this issue was discussed in
                    detail, and the Australian Minister, Neil Blewit, argued vociferously that the
                    negotiations should be postponed. At one point he said, “I hate to say this at
                    this dinner table, but I'm not one for necrophilia. This negotiation is in a
                    rotten dirty, stinking, corpse, and the sooner we recognize that, the better.”
                    And John Crosby, who had in a very droll wit, said, “Well, we have in a song in
                    Newfoundland,” from which he hailed, “and it goes, she may be dead, but she
                    won't lie down.” And that became the metaphor for the negotiations, because the
                    negotiations frequently were stalled and in crisis, and seemed to be hopelessly
                    deadlocked. But it just wouldn't lie down.</p>
                <p>At any event, we went to the conference in Brussels. Of course, the other thing
                    that would have been useful, I thought, was the symbolism of calling off this
                    conference that had been arranged by the Community. It was on their turf. It
                    would have had enormous shock value, I thought, in terms of catalyzing the
                    Community position. But in any event, we went there, and of course it failed.
                    There were brief moments of hope. The way that meeting was organized was that
                    various ministers were given responsibility for groups of subjects, not
                    necessarily the specific negotiating groups. But in any event, agriculture was
                    given to the Swedish Minister of Agriculture, Mats Helstrom. And he was very
                    determined, and offered a proposal that we had problems with; others had
                    problems with it as well. He then offered another proposal which didn't fare any
                    better.</p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>Finally by mid-week several people said, “Look, forget it. This isn't going
                    anywhere.” The Community was largely silent. They had a very defensive position.
                    The whole thing in retrospect was absolutely ludicrous because here we were at
                    the final meeting, but we hadn't started negotiating. Well, the notion was that
                    if we could get some breakthroughs there, of course the drafting could then go
                    on for another several months, and we could clean it up. But it never really had
                    a chance.</p>
                <p>One of the things that provided a little bit of hope, was that there was an
                    assumption that at the critical moment the Germans would come around and tilt
                    the argument within the Community in favor of a solution or a viable position.
                    And the assumption was that Helmut Kohl was indebted to George Bush, because of
                    Bush's support of reunification of Germany. But there was a German election on
                    the Sunday preceding the opening of the negotiations. The negotiations started
                    on Monday, and on Sunday were the German elections. And once those elections
                    were out of the way, we assumed that Kohl would then be free to take the kind of
                    position we hoped he would. While the French were a major problem in respect of
                    agriculture, the Germans were equally as bad. Their Minister of Agriculture, a
                    bullet-headed Bavarian, named Kiechle, who at one point in a meeting with us,
                    said “You know, I think you're absolutely right. There should be no export
                    subsidies. In fact, we shouldn't even be exporting agricultural products from
                    Germany. Of course, we shouldn't import either, we should be self-sufficient.”
                    He was a complete Neanderthal.</p>
                <p>Our reliance on Kohl turned out to be what I regarded as one of the major
                    intelligence failures of the negotiations. We did not understand what was
                    driving Helmut Kohl. We did not understand that his relationship with
                    Mitterrand, President of France, had priority over his relationship with George
                    Bush and the United States. And it's not that Kohl didn't try to be helpful. He
                    did, on a number of occasions try to nudge Mitterrand along, but this was not
                    the most important issue for him. So, on Monday morning, nothing had really
                    changed. And nothing changed in the course of the week. In fact, Kohl had a
                    scheduled meeting with Mitterrand, I think on Tuesday of that week, and we
                    anxiously awaited the results of that. There was not even any mention of the
                    negotiations in their press statement.</p>
                <p>Finally, on Thursday morning, Helstrom came up with in a new proposal, and I need
                    to describe a little bit of the substance of the negotiation. As I said, there
                    were three major issues. One was internal support, or internal subsidies. The
                    second was export subsidies. And the third was market access, or the import
                    regime. In 1987, early in the negotiation, right after the negotiation started,
                    I believe it was in June of 1987, President Reagan made a proposal, which was
                    very dramatic, and that was for the complete elimination by the end of the
                    century of all barriers and all distortions to agricultural production and
                    trade. In other words, elimination of all subsidies and all import barriers.
                    Basically free trade and agriculture. This was a startling proposal. I thought
                    it was wonderful. I was outside the government then.</p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>A number of people thought it was unrealistic, overly ambitious, and there was an
                    argument that still goes on to some extent, as to whether that proposal was
                    helpful or not. I thought it was, because I thought it set a goal. It set a
                    target. And coming today, it probably still would be dramatic, but it would not
                    be regarded as so unrealistic. But in 1987, the Soviet Union had not crumbled,
                    free trade agreements hadn't spread through the world, the move toward
                    deregulation and so forth hadn't really taken off. But, in any event, the
                    Community used that as a kind of reason to say well, what you've done is you've
                    terrified our farmers and you've made things much more difficult for us. In
                    1990, in trying to get the negotiations cut back, we said, well, why don't we
                    agree to a 70% reduction over 10 years. in other words, we stretched out the
                    Reagan proposal.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Give a little time to deterrify the farmers.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes, right. It was obviously a negotiating position. That was on the table,
                    but there was no real response from the EC. The Helstrom proposal then was to
                    reduce our proposal by cutting it in half. He said, let's do 35% in five years
                    across the board. That is, internal support, export subsidies, and import
                    barriers. We really did not embrace the idea. We said, well, if the Community
                    prepared to consider it, we would see that as a basis for negotiation. But what
                    is the Community's view? We had an initial meeting, and then the Community had
                    to go off and consult. So the EC Ministerial Council met in Brussels that
                    evening (Thursday), and we had a meeting scheduled for 8 PM. The Community as
                    usual was late. One of the officials coming through the door gave in a negative
                    sign, but we went into the meeting, and McSharry, the Commissioner of
                    Agriculture, represented the EC. Clayton Yeutter was there, and I was with
                    Clayton jointly representing the U.S. There must have been some 15, maybe 20
                    countries represented in this group, Helstrom chairing the overall session, the
                    GATT Director General, Dunkel sitting by his side.</p>
                <p>McSharry then spoke. He seemed to be accepting some of the Helstrom proposal in a
                    somewhat ambiguous statement, but it was not a rejection. It was a rather artful
                    performance in a way, but then the discussion started going around the table. We
                    stayed pretty much silent. People began reacting. Then the Japanese spoke up.
                    And the Japanese said they couldn't accept the proposal at all. That produced a
                    lot of strong criticism of the Japanese. The Koreans made in a statement which
                    was somewhat negative, but unintelligible, as I recall. But then people began
                    asking McSharry just what did he mean, was he really prepared to accept a 36%
                    reduction in export subsidies. He said, “Well, no, I didn't say that.” And then
                    the meeting blew up. It turns out he was really being not only artful, but
                    deceitful. Then there were extremely bitter statements made by a number of
                    countries and then I made a statement also, which was more in sorrow than in
                    anger.</p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>At that point, we all walked out, and were immediately mobbed by the press. I
                    said that the proposal was rejected by the Japanese and the Europeans. And there
                    was absolute pandemonium in this huge barn of a building. In fact, the meeting
                    had to end by Saturday at the latest, because the horse show was coming in. We
                    thought that that was somewhat appropriate, that we were replaced by a horse
                    show. It was in a large, cavernous building, and we were almost crushed by the
                    press coming out of there. And then there were hurried consultations on what
                    happened. Was this the end of the Uruguay Round, and so forth. The Chairman of
                    the Conference, the Uruguayan Minister of Foreign Affairs, again the name
                    escapes me, held consultations with a number of people, and at the end they
                    decided that the negotiations should continue, although it wasn't clear on what
                    basis. The conference was a failure, although there were some statements saying
                    that consultations would be undertaken and to continue to find a basis for
                    continuing the negotiations.</p>
                <p>Following the breakup of the negotiations that Thursday night, we had a
                    debriefing for our advisors. We had an entourage of several hundred private
                    sector representatives as well as press present. We had rented a hotel in
                    Brussels for the American delegation and formally appointed advisors. But then
                    there were a lot of other people in town, hangers-on as it were. So we had this
                    briefing, and it began after midnight. Rufus Yerxa, who was my colleague
                    stationed in Geneva, the deputy USTR stationed in Geneva, and I conducted the
                    briefing.</p>
                <p>I looked at my watch and I said, “It is now December 7, 1990, Pearl Harbor Day,
                    and this debriefing is taking place in an auditorium of our hotel, which is
                    known as the Waterloo Room. I won't comment further on the symbolism.” But it
                    was in a rather sad occasion for me, very disappointing, even though I went to
                    Brussels without great expectations. But at various moments we thought there
                    were possible breakthroughs. The interesting thing was the reaction of our
                    audience. They were almost elated, and came up to me then and the next morning
                    at breakfast to congratulate me. And I said, “What for?” And they said, “Because
                    you stood firm. You didn't cave. And whereas in the previous negotiations we had
                    always caved on agriculture, this time you stood firm, and this was a great
                    victory for the United States.” Well, I didn't quite see it that way. I thought
                    the object of a negotiation was to reach an agreement, and not to fail.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But in a failure builds on an agreement later on,
                        sometimes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Obviously the object not only is to reach an agreement, but to reach an
                    agreement that meets your objectives, which satisfies your interests. And
                    clearly I had no desire to reach an agreement for the sake of an agreement. But
                    I was still disappointed that we had failed. Never mind that it was somebody
                    else's fault, it was still a failure. But I think that the cynical view was that
                    the Community would have loved to have an agreement which was essentially not an
                    agreement, just a papering over once again.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was driving the European Community? They couldn't get
                        it together, or they just didn't want to have this happen? At that time,
                        what was your analysis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Our analysis was that they were just being obdurate, that they were not
                    willing to basically give up any part of the Common Agricultural Policy. They
                    were not prepared to give up export subsidies, to reduce prices, or to end
                    internal support. There was tension within the Community. The Brits and the
                    Dutch and the Danes were pushing to some extent; the Italians slightly. But even
                    within individual member states, there was tension. The German Economic Ministry
                    always talked a great game, saying they were going to make this happen. They
                    were encouraging the view that the Chancellor would come down on the right side.
                    But the Ministry of Agriculture was obdurate. But what we did not know at that
                    time, and this is fairly significant, we did not know until Christmas time 1990,
                    just the week before Christmas, and after the Brussels meeting, that the
                    Commission had undertaken n a study on the Common Agricultural Policy, and had
                    concluded what we knew, that the policy was in terrible disrepair, that it was
                    essentially broken, and that major reform was required. That report then came
                    out in early January.</p>
                <p>Now I said at that time that the Community was negotiating in bad faith. Because
                    here they brought us to Brussels, refusing to negotiate on agriculture, knowing
                    that they had to change their own policies. But they were basically unprepared
                    to negotiate, and it would have been better for them to say, “Look, we have a
                    severe problem. We know we're going to have to change our policy; we're going to
                    have to reach a consensus among the member states, and until this is done let's
                    just suspend the negotiations.” But they did not do that, and so we spent a lot
                    of time spinning wheels.</p>
                <p>We are now in January of 1991 and nothing is happening. We now had another
                    problem, because on March 2 our negotiating authority would expire. The
                    so-called fast track negotiating authority would run out. So we had basically
                    two months to try to revive this negotiation, and get it going. And there were
                    questions about whether we could do that; whether that was even feasible. We
                    were willing to try. We started a series of consultations again. We went to
                    Geneva. There were various groups of people trying to restart the negotiations,
                    but clearly that wasn't going to happen. In the meantime, there were the
                    beginnings of discussions on NAFTA.</p>

                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>KATZ: Let me go back for a moment. We had this problem of fast track. But still
                    there was a brief effort to try to negotiate, that is, to try to conclude the
                    negotiations in time so we could notify Congress. The requirement for fast track
                    was that we notify the Congress of the intention to enter into an agreement. And
                    that drop dead date was March 2. That still would permit us to perhaps, under
                    some interpretations, to continue to negotiate the details. That is, if we could
                    get the basic outline of the agreement, maybe that would have been sufficient to
                    notify the Congress. And then in the meantime, we had the prospect of the
                    negotiation with Mexico and Canada of the NAFTA, the North American Free Trade
                    Agreement. So we pretty much decided we were going to seek a fast track
                    extension, but the question was whether we could do that for the Uruguay Round,
                    given the delays and the disappointments and the prospects. But, at any event,
                    we continued the negotiations. We were no where near in a conclusion by March 2,
                    and now the Community was into its discussions on CAP reforms (common
                    agricultural policy), also complicated by one more round of their annual price
                    decisions.</p>
                <p>Another event was beginning to intervene into these deliberations. As I said
                    earlier, one of the major concessions we had negotiated earlier, was a
                    concession on soy beans, a zero tariff on soy beans. And over the years, the
                    Community began subsidizing their domestic production of oil seeds, to the point
                    where we lost much of our market in the Community. Incidentally, the effect of
                    this was not only to lose our market in the Community, but they were also
                    subsidizing exports of vegetable oils. So we faced unfair competition in the
                    world market. Now part of it was our own fault, because in 1973, following the
                    imposition of price controls in the U.S., we had a supply problem, and we put on
                    an embargo of exports, briefly, and then cut export contracts in half. And that
                    produced a severe shock on the Japanese, who were very dependent on imports of
                    soy beans, and they began to invest in production in Brazil. We created a major
                    competitor in Brazil and to some extent Argentina. And they occupied some of the
                    market.</p>
                <p>At the same time because prices of soybeans rose to very high levels, which
                    incidentally, are not only used to abstract the oil, but what is left after the
                    extraction becomes meal, which is an animal feed. So while we had lost the
                    market for beans and oil and meal to a substantial extent, there was a void
                    created, and a new product came on the market called corn gluten, which is the
                    by-product of the milling of corn, which is the result of another distortion
                    resulting from our agricultural policy, specifically our sugar program. Corn was
                    then used to produce a sweetener, high fructose corn sweetener, which produced
                    this by-product, corn gluten, which we exported like mad to Europe, upsetting
                    their internal policy. And that became another issue in the negotiations. The
                    Community introduced the notion of rebalancing. Basically, they wanted to take
                    back the concession on soy beans, and they also wanted to put limits on imports
                    of corn gluten.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Corn gluten does what?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>KATZ: It's an animal feed. Now, because of their subsidies on oil seeds, we
                    decided, I believe in 1989, to bring a case against the Community in the GATT,
                    for nullification and impairment of our concession. That is, basically they
                    undermined the concession and the term for this in the GATT is nullification and
                    impairment. We brought this case, and we won it. We got a finding in our favor,
                    and that came along in late 1991. The Community was outraged by this. They
                    condemned the report and they shouted and screamed and gnashed their teeth, but
                    we said, well, we've got you to rights. We attempted to negotiate with them, but
                    basically got nowhere, so we decided that we would then do the next thing we
                    were entitled to, which was to retaliate. And we had a lot of argument within
                    the government as to the amount of retaliation, but ultimately we settled on $1
                    billion. So the retaliation would take the form of raising duties on products in
                    the Community. This then became, not an issue in the negotiations as such, but a
                    simultaneous issue, and inevitably got mixed into it.</p>
                <p>Finally, late in the Spring of '91, McSharry, in a meeting with us, attempting to
                    negotiate on this, said that he would be ready to negotiate when he got his
                    mandate from the Commission. That is, they decided on the CAP reform, including
                    reform of the oil seed regime, and then he would be able to negotiate. So we
                    held it off and held it off. Also, because the Community disagreed with some
                    elements of our interpretation of the report, we did an extraordinary thing. We
                    said that we would be willing to relitigate a portion of the report on our
                    original complaint. So we sent it back to the GATT panel for a second report,
                    and once again they came down in our favor, so we were in an extremely strong
                    position.</p>
                <p>McSharry got his mandate in late July of '91, but there are three typical things
                    when negotiating with the Community: first, you can't negotiate with them until
                    they have a mandate, that is, an agreement among the member states on a
                    position. Once they have a mandate, there's nothing left to negotiate, which
                    makes it rather awkward. This is something I discovered as early as the 1960s,
                    but it carried throughout subsequent negotiations. Now, in fact, they do
                    negotiate around the edges, and then they have to go back and get agreement on
                    revising the mandate. But it makes it extremely difficult. Incidentally, that's
                    one of the reasons we have fast track authority, and we always suggested to the
                    Community that they also needed a fast track authority. The second
                    characteristic, as I explained, was that you can't negotiate on agriculture
                    through the Spring, and then the third thing is that you can't negotiate in
                    August. Because in August Europe shuts down, and everyone takes their holidays.
                    And then in September they recover from their August vacations, so that leaves
                    negotiations through October and November, and three weeks of December. And that
                    was pretty much the practice of negotiations.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>So we were now into October and at that point we began a series of meetings at
                    the ministerial level — Hills and Andriessen and McSharry, and the new Secretary
                    of Agriculture, who had been appointed in early 1991, Edward Madigan, a former
                    Congressman from Illinois, and former ranking minority member of the House
                    Agriculture Committee. We began these meetings, not only on agriculture, but on
                    some of the other issues in negotiations where we were at an impasse with the
                    Community. There were some tariff issues where we were seeking to achieve zero
                    duties among major exporting countries. This was the so-called zero-to-zero
                    initiative, which involved the elimination of all duties on a sectoral basis.
                    There were issues with the Community on things like paper and wood products, and
                    electronic articles. I believe aluminum was another one. And then there was a
                    serious problem in the audio-visual area, which the Community portrayed as a
                    cultural issue. They complained about being overrun by U.S. films, and
                    television. Essentially it was French protectionism. And there were some other
                    issues. And then simultaneously the agriculture issue. So we had one session in
                    Brussels. It seemed to move us along in a little bit, but then follow-up
                    meetings of the negotiators didn't record much progress.</p>
                <p>We then began to negotiate more intensively on agriculture. We had a little group
                    that was formed consisting of ourselves, the Community, and the Australians,
                    which was kind of an extension of the meeting I referred to outside of Geneva in
                    the summer of 1990. It was essentially Crowder and myself, and Guy Legras, and
                    Hugo Paeman, who was the overall coordinator for the negotiation for the
                    Community, coming out of DG-1, and Peter Field, the Australian representing
                    Cairns. These meetings began secretly, but ultimately became known. Then, from
                    November to Christmas time, I made six trips to Europe in seven weeks — not
                    scheduled, but that was the way it evolved.</p>
                <p>In late November, there was an annual U.S.- EC summit meeting at The Hague. The
                    President of the Commission, which rotated on a semi-annual basis at the time
                    was the Dutch Prime Minister, whose name was Lubbers, and he was in the Chair.
                    The major issue, apart from Yugoslavia which incidentally had not yet fallen
                    apart, was agriculture. This time, unlike the G-7 Summit, we were in the room;
                    Carla and myself as a back-bencher. The discussion really got very detailed, and
                    President Bush entered fully into the discussion. I was just amazed and
                    pleasantly surprised at President Bush, who instinctively held his own in the
                    discussion.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>There was a break, and then a conversation took place over in the corner between
                    DeLors, who was the President of the Commission, McSharry, and Madigan. We
                    officials, standing off to the side, wondered what this was all about, and then
                    Madigan and McSharry, and Crowder and myself were asked to meet off in another
                    room and they explained what they had talked about. The Community made a
                    proposal, which was essentially based on the Helstrom proposal at Brussels.
                    Instead of 35% over five years, they proposed a 36% cut over six years. We said
                    O.K. But then the issue developed how would the cut in export subsidies be
                    measured? Was it to be measured in dollar terms or in volume terms? We wanted a
                    cut in volume. The Community insisted that it was to be measured in monetary or
                    budgetary terms. We said, but if it is in dollar terms, and the price goes down,
                    then the volume would go up. That can't be. So we had a big argument about that.
                    In any event, we were beginning to finally start a negotiation. We were talking
                    about real things, we were talking about numbers. It was beginning to
                    narrow.</p>
                <p>We then went out, the Ministers reported to the Heads, to Bush and to DeLors and
                    Lubbers. And it was agreed that we would pursue these negotiations. One of the
                    ideas then came up was that the reduction in subsidized exports would be
                    measured by both volume and budget; it would be 36% overall, but three-quarters
                    in volume and one-quarter in money terms. In any event, that meeting ended on in
                    a somewhat cautious note of optimism. We weren't quite there, but at least we
                    were starting. And we had some follow-up discussions.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, there was one event before that summit meeting at the Hague. We had
                    arrived in The Hague for the Summit meeting, but then we were told to go to Rome
                    to brief the President. So they arranged for this little Air Force executive
                    jet, and we got on at about 11 o'clock in the morning. Madigan, Crowder, Carla,
                    and myself. We flew to Rome, and got off this executive jet and got onto Air
                    Force One. They had absolutely nothing to eat on the executive jet. They didn't
                    even have a coke on board. We got to Rome at about 2 o'clock, went immediately
                    aboard Air Force One and waited for the President to come on. Finally the
                    President came on board and we took off, going back to the Hague. And then we
                    got ushered into the conference room.</p>
                <p>This was my first flight on this Air Force One, the Boeing 747. I'd been on the
                    707 several times. But this was not to be believed. The conference room was
                    several times the size of this office. The President came in, Baker, Scowcroft,
                    Madigan, Hills, John Sununu, the Chief of Staff. We started going through the
                    issues and then a steward came in with a plate of munchies, put it in front of
                    the President, and Baker and Scowcroft were passing it back and forth. I was
                    sitting opposite the President at the other end of the conference table, with
                    pangs of hunger. And they brought another plate in, and they began passing it at
                    the other end, and there I am sitting there. And finally Sununu said, “Would you
                    like something?” When the President then went to the summit, he had been
                    briefed, not only with briefing papers, but had the benefit of an oral
                    discussion, so that was a very productive briefing.</p>
                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>Following the meeting at The Hague, there was another trip to Brussels that I
                    made with Madigan and Crowder. We'd had a meeting with McSharry in Brussels and
                    that didn't get anywhere. And then Lubbers came to Brussels. We had met through
                    much of the day with McSharry, and not being able to narrow these differences,
                    we then began meeting with Lubbers, who came into McSharry's office at 2 o'clock
                    in the afternoon. And we went nonstop until 1:30 in the morning. We went almost
                    12 hours, and were unable to break the deadlock.</p>
                <p>We were now into December and getting near Christmas. The idea again to try to
                    finish the negotiations by the end of '91. Finally, Dunkel had decided that some
                    of the other issues were beginning to come together, and there was a lot of
                    agreement language in a report that was being developed. Dunkel then decided
                    that he was going to put all of this together into in a document, which became
                    known as the Draft Final Act, which was in a collection of all of the
                    agreements. We continued to negotiate in Geneva, and then I went flying off to
                    Brussels because there was about to occur a bilateral ministerial meeting
                    between ourselves and the Community. This again was a semi-annual event. One
                    meeting was held at the heads of government level, and there were two at the
                    ministerial level. Baker was there, and so we went to meet with Baker. We flew
                    back to Geneva, reported to Dunkel, and finally Dunkel said, “No matter what
                    happens, whether you finish or not, I'm going to have a draft report, and I'm
                    going to present my own views on the outstanding issues.” For the first time —
                    first and only time — Dunkel decided to take an initiative. He generally seemed
                    to see himself as the arranger of meeting rooms and provider of interpreters and
                    loath to take positions in an effort to move the negotiations.</p>
                <p>So, having gone to Brussels, back to Geneva, and I went back to Brussels again to
                    join this ministerial meeting with Baker. More meetings took place between Baker
                    and DeLors, trying to break the deadlock. At one point Baker said to Carla and
                    me, “I think you guys have really become somewhat unreasonable. This is your
                    best chance. This is your only chance to end the negotiation, and anyway, Dunkel
                    is going to produce this report, and you know, you may be worse off after the
                    report.” I replied, “No, I don't think so. I think what Dunkel has in his report
                    will be more to our liking than it will be to the Community's liking.”</p>
                <p>Dunkel kept holding off hour by hour, delaying, delaying, hoping we would reach
                    agreement. And finally, around midnight, the report came out. We got the word of
                    this, and it was pretty much along our lines. He to some extent, had cut the
                    baby in half, but had taken more of our views. The Community was absolutely
                    outraged. And the next morning, we had this plenary meeting of the ministers.
                    They went berserk. Dunkel had betrayed them; it was a put-up job between the
                    Americans and Dunkel. At one point Baker took us aside and tried to get
                    something started again. But Lubbers refused saying, “It's all over. We're not
                    going to proceed in this way.”</p>

                <p>So that ended up in a pretty somber ride home on the airplane from Brussels just
                    before Christmas. I was absolutely exhausted, having had two months of this
                    shuttling back and forth, ultimately to no avail. Except that we had the draft
                    report, the Dunkel draft report, which was, on the whole a pretty good document.
                    There were some things in it we didn't like, but it was basically more to our
                    liking than to the Community.</p>
                <p>Some thought that we should endorse the Dunkel text as it was. The Australians in
                    particular urged us to do this. I was sympathetic to this view. But we had some
                    problems with the intellectual property section and with the anti-dumping text.
                    I thought these were things we could live with, but the private sector, the
                    pharmaceutical industry, was unhappy about the transition provisions on products
                    that were in the research pipeline — too long before they received protection.
                    The protectionist industries, such as steel, didn't like the dumping provisions,
                    and wanted more there. But the basic problem was that the Community was just
                    furious.</p>
                <p>In January of 1992, we had a meeting with Andriessen. He came in an absolutely
                    sullen mood. We asked what could we do, and he said, “Well, we can't do
                    anything. This has really set us back to the point that this is impossible.” It
                    was almost childlike behavior. At one point I said, “Why don”t we just drop
                    agriculture. It's just too difficult to do. It was a good try, we came close.
                    We'll have to fight it another day. Let's just drop it.” “We can't do that,
                    that's impossible,” he said. I said, “Well, we can't agree. Why should we hold
                    the rest of the negotiation up?” But he had no ideas, the whole thing was
                    hopeless. But finally coming out of that, we agreed that we would start
                    something at the level of officials. And we began another series of secret
                    meetings, just the U.S. and EC. Again, Crowder and myself. And our two
                    counterparts from the Community, Legras and Hugo Paeman, who, incidentally, is
                    about to become the Ambassador from the Community, now the European Union, in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>So we began these meetings, alternating in Washington and Europe. We met every
                    few weeks in February, March, and April. Incidentally, we were now dealing both
                    with the agricultural issues in the negotiations, and the oil seeds issue. We
                    now had the second GATT panel report. The Community began to face up to it and
                    said O.K. They made a proposal which would involve reducing production, by
                    putting limits on acreage in the Community. And we began trying to narrow these
                    issues and reach agreement. There was one meeting we held at Heathrow Airport.
                    We flew to New York, on the day flight, spent the night at Heathrow, met all
                    day, and took the six o'clock flight back from Heathrow to New York, and then
                    back to Washington. I got home at two o'clock in the morning. I said, “I ain't
                    never going to do that again.” That was one of the dumbest thing I'd ever
                    done.</p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>We came to April, and again, there was one of the heads of government meeting.
                    DeLors came to Washington and met with the President. We got nowhere. At the
                    time, Arthur Dunkel was in Washington, and asked me to have a drink with him. I
                    met with him, and gave him a full briefing on these bilateral talks. I told him
                    that the talks were not getting anywhere, and as Director General, I thought
                    that he had the responsibility to bring these negotiations back to Geneva. I
                    thought that it was unfair to the other participants in the negotiations. They
                    ought to know what is going on, and that he as Director General ought to lay it
                    out. He was very uncomfortable. He was very defensive because of the attack he
                    had been under from the Community. They pretty much wouldn't talk to him
                    anymore. He made some efforts in Brussels, but he wasn't getting anywhere.</p>
                <p>There was another meeting then, in May, with Jim Baker at the Blair House, and
                    with Andriessen and McSharry that got nowhere. Summer came up again. By then we
                    decided we were going to retaliate over oilseeds, and with great difficulty, we
                    finally reached agreement within the Administration that we would retaliate to
                    the extent of $1 billion, but would do it in three tranches. That is, we would
                    do it in $300-350 million slices; if there were no agreement, we would do
                    another tranche, and then another tranche. But this was the shot across the bow
                    that really caught their attention. It was high-risk strategy, because had we
                    actually imposed the retaliation, the negotiations would have been over. But
                    they may have been over anyway, and I thought we had nothing to lose. I was
                    arguing very strongly for this. We had in a number of high level confrontations
                    within the Administration, meeting in the Situation Room, where we argued it,
                    and finally got an agreement. Interestingly, Larry Eagleburger, Deputy Secretary
                    of State, was very strongly supporting this. The White House, specifically the
                    NSC, and the CEA, and the Treasury were very nervous about it, but we got
                    agreement. So that provided the spark.</p>
                <p>In October we began another set of meetings. Now for the first time Andriessen
                    really became engaged. But the other thing that happened was now we had the 1992
                    Presidential election. And by September, President Bush's fortunes were not
                    looking very promising. Baker had now gone into the White House as Chief of
                    Staff, but clearly without a great deal of enthusiasm. There was a dispirited
                    view in the White House itself, which was pretty clear, and the Community was
                    beginning to question whether these were the folks they ought to be negotiating
                    with. But they had the oil seeds thing hanging over their heads, and we were
                    arguing that we could finish this, we could get it done, and that you really
                    wanted to finish this thing with the Bush Administration. If there were a
                    Clinton Administration, it might mean starting all over again?</p>
                <pb facs="0110" n="Page0110"/>
                <p>Inevitably with a new Administration, you don't know what that Administration is
                    going to be like; there was some ambivalence in Clinton's position on trade at
                    the time. So they said, “O.K., let's do it.” We then had a further effort in
                    October that still didn't close the gap. There were some meetings that
                    Agriculture had on its own. Joe O'Mara, who was now the principal USDA official,
                    Crowder having left the Government; he was not succeeded as such, but
                    effectively was succeeded by Joe O'Mara, who had been an assistant to him.
                    O'Mara had some meetings with Legras which didn't get very far.</p>
                <p>Next there was a meeting in Chicago between Madigan and McSharry. I went there
                    and we met on the Sunday night before election day, on Tuesday. We started with
                    a dinner meeting, and didn't get any where. We met the next morning, and again
                    didn't make much headway. We took a break, then resumed. Incidentally, McSharry
                    had been scheduled to leave on Monday. This was basically to be an overnight
                    meeting. We kept going, we kept breaking, resuming, and finally decided that we
                    would go over to the next day. We had a social dinner, which was very amusing,
                    because McSharry could be very funny. He was engaging in a certain amount of
                    character analysis of people in the Community, which was amusing. We met the
                    next morning. We were drafting and trying to find language, and we still
                    couldn't come to an agreement. Madigan decided that he had to go vote, and he
                    wanted to go vote in his district in Southern Illinois. He had arranged for in a
                    private plane to take him and was going to come back in the afternoon. He got
                    delayed by traffic and McSharry was determined to leave that evening.</p>
                <p>We were meeting in a hotel suite, and they had checked out of their rooms. A
                    telephone call came for McSharry from Brussels in our Suite. We were in the
                    bedroom, and he was in the living room, in a very agitated state. I wasn't
                    trying to eavesdrop, but he was clearly very angry. Madigan was late in coming
                    back. He had landed in Chicago and was trying to get through traffic from the
                    airport. The Community people were all standing in their overcoats, ready to
                    leave. And we said, “Well, we just heard that they are just a couple of blocks
                    away, they will be here shortly.”</p>
                <p>Incidentally, a new issue had arisen about a so-called “peace clause.” McSharry
                    wanted a provision in the agreement which said that during that the six year
                    implementation period there would be no dispute cases brought in the GATT
                    against the Community. Having in mind the oil seeds case, he did not want to
                    have a repeat of that. We had resisted that for a long time, but finally we
                    worked out some language which essentially took the provisions already agreed
                    upon and turned it into something the Community could claim was a peace clause.
                    We would not be giving anything up, except in language. So we had tried that
                    out, and McSharry reacted very badly. Madigan finally returned, and the
                    Community was still there in their overcoats. And they were summarizing where we
                    were, and said, “What about the peace clause?” And I described what we were
                    prepared to do. And he blew up, and said, “I'm not going to sit around here and
                    listen to a lot of fookin garbage by a lot of fookin officials and he just
                    stormed and raged. Finally they left.</p>
                <pb facs="0111" n="Page0111"/>
                <p>The next day, after McSharry got back to Brussels, he resigned his responsibility
                    for the agriculture negotiations. What we had not known was that telephone
                    conversation in our suite had been with DeLors. And DeLors had criticized him,
                    saying “What are you doing in Chicago negotiating? You don't have any authority
                    to negotiate.” So when he got back to Brussels, he said, “I'm through. Get
                    somebody else to negotiate this. I'm not going to negotiate.” The British were
                    then in the Presidency, and this became a little bit of a scandal in Brussels,
                    and DeLors went to London to meet with Prime Minister John Major. Major,
                    incidentally, was trying to be very helpful in the negotiations. By then another
                    two more G-7 Summits had taken place, and Major was trying to be helpful. When
                    DeLors came out of 10 Downing Street, he was besieged by the press. I have a
                    picture of someone holding up a sign, saying, “Up yours DeLors!”</p>
                <p>McSharry was coaxed back into the negotiations, with Andriessen. They came to
                    Washington. The meeting was held at Blair House. And again, they came in late in
                    the afternoon. We had some finger food for dinner, but they didn't want to meet
                    very late. We kind of outlined where we were and then started the next morning.
                    We outlined the positions and then agreed to recess for a time. They had made a
                    proposal to us that night. We took it on board, reworked it the next day, gave
                    it back to them in the early afternoon. Now this time it wasn't McSharry who
                    exploded, it was Andriessen, saying, “You haven't paid any attention to anything
                    we've said.” Clearly the problems with the French were paramount at that point.
                    We had narrowed the reduction in export subsidies to 24% on a volume basis, and
                    36% on a value basis. The French were balking at that. They tried to bring the
                    volume down to 21%. The oil seeds issue loomed large and we were exchanging
                    various formulations on that. I had said previously to Carla Hills that when we
                    brought our proposal back if they rejected it, that she should not let the
                    meeting break up, but she should take the Ministers off privately and keep
                    working on them. And so that's what happened. They went off into another room.
                    They were there for about one hour. Andriessen was the first one to come out of
                    the room. He came back looking very sullen and not communicating with us, but
                    talking to Paeman in Flemish. I couldn't understand that, so I got up, walked
                    out, and McSharry had gone to the front of the Blair House to use the telephone.
                    I walked back into the room, and Madigan and Carla were there, and they were in
                    a bit of an argument. Obviously they had exchanged some other numbers, and
                    Madigan was kind of shaking his head, saying “I don't think we can do it. I
                    think that doesn't go far enough. I don't think we can accept it.”</p>
                <p>Then Carla and I went to the front of Blair House, to in a little room, and we
                    talked. I said, “We're getting awfully close.” Then Madigan came in the room,
                    and there was more conversation. I wandered out, and there was McSharry, and he
                    pulled me across the hall, and we began a little scrum there. McSharry clearly
                    wanted an agreement. We were joined by other people, and then that broke up, and
                    another scrum in another place. Madigan disappeared. Finally things were
                    beginning to come together. The Uruguay Round issues I think had been pretty
                    much settled; we were very close on those. But the oil seeds, how they would
                    actually cut production, was the issue.</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>Finally it was agreed that a statement would be made and the Ministers would go
                    out to the front of Blair House to meet the press which was gathered on
                    Pennsylvania Avenue. They would go out there and give their statements to the
                    press. But Madigan would not agree. So we walked back into the back room.
                    Madigan had been on the telephone with the oil seeds constituency, saying “I'm
                    sorry, I can't go along with it.” So we went out and the Community people were
                    standing in their overcoats again; they had been in their overcoats for about
                    one hour at this point — and I said to Legras, “Guy, why is it that you people
                    always negotiate with your overcoats on?” So in the end, it was decided that
                    there was nothing that could be said, and we said, “Well, we need a little more
                    time to consult.” The Community had to catch their plane, so they went off.</p>
                <p>We then went across the street to the White House, meeting in the Situation Room
                    with Baker, Eagleburger, Scowcroft, Madigan, Hills, Zoellick, and myself.
                    Madigan saying, “I don't think we can do it. The rest of you can go ahead and
                    recommend this, but I can't go along.” I argued that we should do the deal. I
                    said this was the best shot we had. Carla supported me. Eagleburger, agreed with
                    us , as did Zoellick. Baker said very little, taking no position. In any event,
                    we met until about 10 o'clock at night. It was agreed that there would be a
                    meeting with the President in the morning, with Carla and Madigan.</p>
                <p>Carla and I went back to our office, I had a feeling that if this were presented
                    to the agricultural producers they would go along. So I began calling some of
                    them, trying to reach them at 11 o'clock at night and later. The most important
                    guy was the head of the Farm Bureau, who was in Australia. But I reached one of
                    his people in Washington who said he would try to reach him.</p>
                <p>The next morning I met with the oil seed producers. I had had kind of a rough
                    session with them once before, when we had decided to go back to the GATT a
                    second time. But the President of the group ultimately became a supporter of me.
                    He was in a farmer from Florida. The poor man was killed about one year ago in a
                    tractor accident. But after that first rough session, he came in and said, “You
                    know, my daddy always told me to pay attention to people with white hair.” But
                    when I brought him in that morning after Blair House and told him that we were
                    going to go ahead, and what the deal was, he was unhappy. He said, “Look. I have
                    to tell you that this is a bitter pill. But I know you've done the best you can,
                    and it's a judgment you have to make, and I will support it,” which really made
                    me feel good.</p>
                <p>The head of the Farm Bureau, Dean Kleckner, supported it. In the meantime, the
                    President had decided we would go forward. It was decided that Madigan should
                    call McSharry and see if he could push him just a little more, but that if he
                    couldn't that we would accept a deal. McSharry and Andriessen had gotten the
                    support of the Commission.</p>

                <p>So the agreement was announced late Friday morning. Madigan, to his credit, went
                    out and defended it. He was a good soldier. It was less than we wanted, but we
                    thought was good enough, particularly given the rest of what was at stake in the
                    rest of the negotiations. So we thought we had a major breakthrough. It was now,
                    November 18, and we thought that we could finish the negotiations by the end of
                    the year. And so we put on a mad rush. There were meetings going through the
                    night in Geneva. But we still couldn't quite do it.</p>
                <p>Of course, we would be out of office on January 21st. On January 2 a new
                    Commission was to take over in Europe. Andriessen was out; McSharry was out, and
                    the new Commissioner for Trade was Sir Leon Brittan, who had been Commissioner
                    for Competition Policy. He asked to meet with us. So, on New Year's Day, Carla
                    and I flew to London. We took the day flight, spent the night at Heathrow, and
                    then met all day the on the 2nd, with Leon Brittan, who was a breath of fresh
                    air, compared to Andriessen . I said to Carla, “You know, if he had been here
                    six months ago, we'd have finished this thing.” He was fairly well briefed,
                    accompanied by Hugo Paeman. We went through the issues, saw where the problems
                    were, agreed that we would make an effort to bring the issues to closure. There
                    were recent tentative understandings on where there would be give on both sides,
                    or where there might be give on both sides, and that we would try to finish this
                    before January 21st. Not, obviously, being able to sign an agreement, but
                    essentially breaking the back of all of the remaining issues. We thought we had
                    settled agriculture, but there was audio-visual, there were some tariff issues,
                    anti-dumping issues, and textiles were another major issue. Essentially, we
                    would break the back of the issues, give it to the new Administration, and
                    permit them to finish this.</p>
                <p>We had told the transition team what we were doing. And we didn't ask them to
                    agree, we said, “Look, here's what we're doing. Of course, you are free to do
                    what you want thereafter, but we think it is our responsibility to bring this as
                    far as we can.” So we came back to Washington. We called the textile industry
                    and told them what we were going to do, which they were very unhappy about, but
                    they saw the handwriting on the wall, and told the other industry groups.</p>
                <p>We then talked to Leon Brittan and it was clear that things had changed and that
                    he was beginning to pull back. And I think what happened was again, the
                    Community got an attack of doubt — should they be doing this deal with a lame
                    duck administration that had less than three weeks. And so the effort failed and
                    we left office on January 20th. I stayed three more weeks. Mickey Kantor asked
                    me to stay a month to help get organized. After one week it was clear I didn't
                    have a whole lot to do; I was basically briefing, but I was out of the loop and
                    kind of uncomfortable, so after three weeks I left. I think maybe this is in a
                    good place to break.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Again, I want to ask about the role of intelligence. Not
                        interpretation. I'd also like to ask about the role of our various
                        embassies. While all these things were going on with the economic community,
                        they must have been taking soundings and pushing things in a bit. And then,
                        on NAFTA, of course, and also on the role of NAFTA: did it play any part in
                        being a looming cloud over the negotiations with the EC, as far as, in a new
                        game is beginning to play over here, and maybe we'll just forget the EC, or
                        something like that. Those are some of the questions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: There's also the great mystery: how could we do two negotiations at the
                    same time? I think those are good points. We also have the Russian thing.</p>

                <p>KATZ: I was not directly involved in that, but I can comment on some of that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 21st of September.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: And for some reason it's not the first day of fall, which destroys seven
                    decades of mythology. I always thought that the autumnal equinox came on
                    September 21, but it's September 23.</p>
                <p>O.K., why don't we do NAFTA. Let me begin by saying that Mexico had a long
                    history of antipathy, if not antagonism, toward the United States, going back to
                    the last century. After the revolution in 1928, there was a long period of very
                    inward-looking economic policies. So Mexico was not a member of the GATT, for
                    example. We had a pre-war trade agreement with them, which was more honored in
                    the breach.</p>
                <p>Beginning in the 1970s there was some effort to reform their economy. Their
                    economy was highly statist, with a great deal of nationalized property,
                    beginning of course, with the oil industry, the hydrocarbon industry, and energy
                    generally. Metals and minerals were partially state-owned, transportation of
                    course, and telecommunications, as in most places in the world. Their trade was
                    highly restricted, with very restrictive quotas. There was an effort in the '70s
                    to begin to break out of this, and an effort was made to enter the GATT. But
                    that was viewed as treason by some people in Mexico, especially among some
                    industrialists. So that effort was pretty well scotched. But clearly things were
                    beginning to rumble there.</p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>There was at the end of the Carter administration a group of private American
                    citizens, Henry Kissinger being one of them, who were involved in a dialogue
                    with the Mexicans. And just before the Reagan presidency, I believe it was in
                    the transition, Reagan had a meeting with the President of Mexico, and there was
                    some discussion about closer economic collaboration. Then, of course, came the
                    collapse in oil prices and the debt crisis. The Mexican economy really went into
                    the tank.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was during the early '80s.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes. Reagan came in 1981, but by '82 they were in deep trouble. President
                    Lopez Portillo left under a cloud, because of a question of personal enrichment.
                    But anyway, there were beginnings of new winds blowing in Mexico. Before
                    President Bush came into office, he again had some discussions with President
                    Salinas, but nothing very specific came out of that. That was in late 1988. Then
                    in 1987 came the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Agreement, and that obviously set people
                    in Mexico to thinking. President Salinas preceded by President de la Madrid, had
                    begun taking some market-opening measures. And in 1986 Mexico actually entered
                    the GATT, for the first time. And they began bringing down their protection very
                    rapidly. They came from almost infinite protection, down to bound rates of 50%,
                    that is, rates to which they were committed not to exceed. In fact, they were
                    bringing rates down to around 20%, and ultimately down to around an average
                    about 10%, with some quotas remaining, but a commitment to get rid of them.</p>
                <p>President Salinas then began traveling around the world, trying to encourage
                    investment in Mexico. He took a trip to Japan, which was not terribly
                    encouraging. Then in early 1990 he went to Europe. That came as kind of a shock
                    to him. He ended his trip at the World Economic Forum in Davos, an annual event
                    that draws many important figures in the world: ministers, ex-ministers, CEOs of
                    major companies, and some heads of government. When he got to Davos, in
                    Switzerland, at this World Economic Conference meeting, the buzz was about
                    Central and Eastern Europe. Of course, the old Soviet empire had disintegrated
                    by then, and everybody was talking about the great investment opportunities in
                    Eastern and Central Europe and Russia.</p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>The other thing that was going on in Europe was something called “EC 92,” that
                    is, a program in the European Community to remove the remaining internal
                    barriers to trade to dissolve the borders for economic purposes, to harmonize
                    regulations, remove all remaining customs barriers, and harmonize banking
                    regulations, standards, and to complete the so-called single market. So what
                    Salinas found was that Europe was very inward looking at that point. Their
                    preoccupation was building this internal market with a lot of investment having
                    flowed into Europe to get behind this new wall, and then beyond that, all the
                    external interest was to the east. And so as Salinas surveyed the horizon in
                    North America, there was the United States and Canada, and Canada was a bit of a
                    competitive threat to Mexico, or at least a threat to their aspirations, not a
                    real threat, because Mexico was not a legitimate competitor of Canada at that
                    point. But certainly as an aspiring competitor, they would be shut out. As you
                    looked across the Pacific, nobody there with any great interest, and in Europe
                    very little interest. So he decided at some moment in that period, and I don't
                    know if that was a confirmation of something he'd been thinking about, but he
                    decided that Mexico needed a home, as it were — an economic home.</p>
                <p>After he returned from Davos, sometime late in February, on one Sunday night, he
                    telephoned George Bush and said “I'd like to do a free-trade agreement with the
                    United States.” This came to us as a little bit of a surprise. Not a tremendous
                    surprise, because there had been some rumblings about it, even going back as far
                    as the Reagan Administration, but mostly by Americans. Some Mexicans had also
                    expressed interest, but they were private sector people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just to get a little feel for the role of your operation,
                        your office at that time, were you looking around for places to make
                        agreements, or were you so busy that you ...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: No. We were pretty fully occupied with the Uruguay Round negotiations,
                    which we were supposed to finish at the end of 1990, we were committed to
                    finishing at the end of 1990. We had a tremendous amount to do to get there,
                    because we had the problem with Europe and agriculture, and hadn't really gotten
                    that started, and we were pushing the Europeans to do that, plus all the other
                    issues in the Uruguay Round. And then we had a normal array of bilateral issues
                    around the world: Japan and specific issues such as telecommunications. We had a
                    separate mandate under law to examine barriers to U.S. telecommunications trade,
                    and then we had a similar provision with respect to government procurement and
                    we had another mandate with respect to intellectual property. So we had a pretty
                    full plate. Also I had just initiated a trade agreement negotiation with the
                    Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>So the word came from the White House that Salinas had made this bid, and we had
                    to go to work quickly to see what we thought about it; what were we going to
                    recommend.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just one other thing, on the operational side: Is there
                        sort of a free trade agreement “folder” that one has tucked away somewhere,
                        that you pull out and fill in the blanks?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>KATZ: No, not at that point. Of course, we had the precedent of the Canadian
                    agreement, which was a pretty good agreement, but which fell short in a number
                    of ways. No, we hadn't really gotten to that point. In fact, there was still a
                    certain amount of tension between the view of some people, particularly some
                    people in the Administration, Jim Baker, Bob Zoellick and Bob Mosbacher, who
                    thought that we ought to do bilateral free trade agreements wherever we could.
                    And then there were the old multilateralists, like myself, who thought that our
                    primary interest was in fostering the multilateral system. So that was certainly
                    in the back of my mind when I was confronted with this issue by Carla Hills. I
                    did have the concern about the diversion of attention away from the Uruguay
                    Round, but more than anything I was skeptical about the Mexicans, and about how
                    far they were really prepared to go. When they said a free-trade agreement, did
                    they mean a true free-trade agreement in the sense of a reciprocal comprehensive
                    free trade agreement, or were they looking for a special, preferential
                    arrangement, really kind of a one-way free-trade agreement.</p>
                <p>There was one other question that bothered me. And that is, we had a major
                    interest in Mexico, but we had other interests in the region, particularly in
                    the Caribbean region. And would an agreement with Mexico result in the diversion
                    of trade away from the Caribbean countries? So we discussed this, and decided we
                    had to do a little bit of work before we came to a decision. The first question
                    we looked at was this question of diversion, and we put our economists to work
                    on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a stable of economists that knew the
                        Caribbean economies, the Mexican economies, that you draw on in your office?
                        Or did you go elsewhere? How did you do it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: “Stable” is a vast overstatement. We had an Office of the Chief Economist
                    with an excellent economist, David Walters, with an assistant, who was borrowed
                    from the International Trade Commission. And we had the equivalent of a country
                    desk. We had some people who were working on the Caribbean area. In any event,
                    we put the economist to work, and he came up with a report that concluded that
                    the diversionary effects would be minimal. Something which, incidentally, is
                    still being argued.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The real interest for us was we wanted to make sure the
                        Caribbean countries were viable, right?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>KATZ: We did not want to destabilize that area by causing economic harm. But the
                    conclusion was that the diversionary effects would not be very great. So that
                    was not a consideration. As far as the Uruguay Round issue, I concluded pretty
                    quickly that was not something that was a primary concern. My view was that I
                    got my training in the infantry, and if there was one more hill that you had to
                    climb, or walk another mile, or fire another shot, you did it. If we worked 12
                    hours a day, well then we'd have to work 14 hours a day. But that could not be a
                    reason not to do it. And the other question about whether the Mexicans were
                    interested in the right kind of agreement, we would have to test, by entering
                    into some preliminary discussions with them to see how far they were prepared to
                    go in producing terms of reference for the negotiation.</p>
                <p>So, that was basically what we went back to the President with. To be very
                    candid, left to my own devices, I would have probably argued for putting this
                    off for a year. But there were some internal politics involved too, and it was
                    characterized by the phrase that we did not want USTR to be viewed elsewhere in
                    the Administration as “wet serapes.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What does that mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Wet blankets. We were not going to rain on this parade. So, there was
                    pressure for us not to be negative, and we quickly concluded that we wouldn't,
                    but that there were legitimate questions that had to be asked and answers had to
                    be found, and we proceeded to do that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This became a great political issue, which we kind of knew
                        it would.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Well, that was later. I'm now speaking not of the public aspects of this,
                    but the internal administration deliberations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So at that point, you weren't saying, “Gee, will the
                        public buy this?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: No, that was another consideration, but in fact, early in our report to the
                    President, we did make that point too. We said that we had looked at this, and
                    we were concerned about the Caribbean, and we'd satisfied ourselves that that
                    was not a major preoccupation. I don't know if we commented on the Uruguay
                    Round, or whether we just satisfied ourselves on that. We just set it aside. We
                    also strongly urged that we seek consultations with the leadership of the
                    Congress before we proceeded. And with Labor, although I'm not sure that came up
                    in that first report to the President. But the President said, O.K., go
                    ahead.</p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>So we proceeded. Carla Hills went up and spoke to Rostenkowski, the chairman of
                    the Ways and Means Committee, Lloyd Bentsen, chairman of the Finance Committee —
                    those were our two primary committees of jurisdiction, and also to the ranking
                    Minority Members of those two committees. And the advice that we got was
                    basically, “Boy, if I were you I wouldn't do it. You've got enough on your plate
                    right now, but it's your call.” So we had, I would say, grudging support. And I
                    would have to say also, by way of background, that we had excellent
                    relationships with our congressional committees. They were very supportive. They
                    did provide advice, but they were very supportive, so that while they had
                    reservations about this, not so much on political grounds at that point, but
                    really in terms of “do you really want to take this on? You've got more than you
                    can handle. But if you think you can do it, go ahead.” We did not go outside the
                    Congress. This was still pretty private and confidential.</p>
                <p>Then we began some discussions with the Mexicans. We had a series of
                    conversations. We tried first to negotiate a statement, and what we wanted was a
                    comprehensive agreement, covering trade and goods and services, investment, and
                    intellectual property. Those were the four basic pillars. The Mexicans did a lot
                    of squirming. First they said “sure, the agreement would be comprehensive.” “On
                    all four points?” “ Well, yeah, on all four points.” Of course, that didn't mean
                    that there wouldn't problems in each of these areas. So we got past that, and
                    sometime in the spring of 1990 it was decided that the two Presidents — and I
                    think they met somewhere, on the edge of some other event — should ask their
                    Trade Ministers to make a recommendation to them as to the feasibility of the
                    negotiation and the terms of reference, and so forth. That's when we began
                    having very active negotiations about the shape of the table, as it were. That
                    is, what would the nature of this negotiation be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But just to put it in perspective, this whole project was
                        very much presidential driven. You obviously, if you had your druthers,
                        wouldn't have done it at that point. How did you feel — did the Mexicans had
                        the same attitude?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: It was all go on their part. I should identify the players apart from the
                    two Presidents. The primary interface was between the Mexican Trade Minister,
                    Jaime Serra Puche, and Carla Hills. And then at the next level, Serra's deputy,
                    Herminio Blanco Mendoza, and myself. When we met, generally the four of us met,
                    or I would deal with Blanco, but basically it was the four of us. But two other
                    elements came into this pre-negotiation. For one thing we were required under
                    the law to review annually the performance of countries on intellectual
                    property. We had to determine whether countries were targets or actionable
                    countries, or priority countries, or priority watch countries. We had
                    intellectual property problems with Mexico of long standing.</p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>Another annual exercise was to decide on the lists of commodities subject to, or
                    available for generalized preferences. This preferential tariff treatment
                    applied to developing countries, of which Mexico still was one. And there was a
                    connection between the two. If a country was a very bad performer under
                    intellectual property, they could lose their GSP eligibility. So we had this
                    side negotiation going on, and it became very much involved in the pre-free
                    trade negotiations too. Carla Hills applied heavy pressure on the Mexicans to
                    come up with a good intellectual property agreement.</p>
                <p>In fact, we ended up with a terrific agreement, far beyond what the Mexicans had
                    any intention of agreeing to when they started. There were some very politically
                    difficult things, like compulsory licensing of pharmaceutical patents. It is a
                    worldwide problem in many countries. The laws require that pharmaceutical
                    companies give up their patents or license local firms to produce their
                    products. We always regarded that as a taking of intellectual property. So we
                    got satisfaction on that and on parallel imports, and a whole series of
                    copyright protections. Mexico, like many countries, pretty much ignored, or did
                    not enforce copyright laws. So that books, publications, music, computer tapes,
                    video tapes, etc., were being counterfeited or effectively stolen. So we got
                    that agreement.</p>
                <p>We also resolved the GSP issues and then at the same time we were negotiating
                    what was it was we were going to report back to the Presidents. And then
                    finally, on August 1st of 1992, the four of us met. We'd had a number of
                    meetings along the way, but we flew out to Los Angeles, and met there. Through
                    the course of the day we negotiated a statement, which was essentially the terms
                    of reference. This was a joint report to the two Presidents, which basically a
                    statement that we thought that an agreement was feasible.</p>
                <p>We also talked about the timing of the negotiations. The Mexicans were very
                    concerned that this negotiation be completed and ratified before 1992. And what
                    they were concerned about was, first of all, was the U.S. election in 1992, and
                    secondly, there was a Mexican election a year later. And they did not want this
                    to go over into the Mexican elections. But they also had in mind they didn't
                    want it to really be an issue in the U.S. elections. They were maybe a little
                    more farsighted than we were in that respect. Now I said I thought this was
                    doable in that period of time. Having started out as a skeptic, I became an
                    enthusiast. And I said that if 'twere done well, 'twere done quickly, and in
                    fact, I didn't see any reason why we couldn't do it.</p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>I outlined what I said was a back-to-the-future scenario: take the date, and then
                    work back from that. And what would that require? Well, it would require that we
                    start pretty much in that Autumn of 1990, and do the preliminary, what I call
                    pre-negotiation phase. And that is, to use a litigation analogy, discovery. That
                    is, you exchange information on tariffs, regulations, you identify difficult
                    sectors, and we knew there were some, such as automobiles, energy, (I'll have to
                    come back to energy), and you begin trying to develop solutions to problems, or
                    at least options for solutions. You're not really negotiating, but you're
                    conceptualizing. You're laying out the map of the negotiation and
                    conceptualizing possible solutions to difficult problems without really being in
                    a bargaining stage. Now, there's a reason for that; a reason why I suggested
                    that. And that had to do with our fast-track authority.</p>
                <p>The term fast-track is really a misnomer. The first thing to understand about
                    fast-track is that it is not fast. It is a procedure that gives you some
                    certainty that if you inform the Congress in a timely fashion, if you consult
                    closely with the Congress, and then you bring back an agreement, which the
                    Congress has been informed about all through the negotiation, then the Congress
                    will take that and consider it and decide within a specific time frame, but
                    importantly not change the agreement. That is, they will ultimately vote up or
                    down within a fixed timetable.</p>
                <p>So what fast-track required in the first instance, is that we provide 60 days
                    notice of intention to enter into an agreement. Now, this is 60 legislative
                    days. Sixty legislative days we calculated in August of 1990, would take us
                    through until about perhaps May 1st of the next year, because we were assuming
                    that their would be a recess. Since we were going into the Autumn there would be
                    a recess from sometime in October until January. So this would stretch out over
                    a long period of time. And we would use this period of time to conduct the
                    pre-negotiations. So that when we started, we could pretty well finish the
                    negotiations quickly. I estimated in seven or eight months. That would take us
                    through the end of 1991. We could then present the agreement to the Congress in
                    January of 1992, and by the end of June, we'd have it all wrapped up, and put
                    into force in September or October.</p>
                <p>I have to say that I tend to be optimistic about these things because I have
                    never gotten over the tendency to assume that people are going to be reasonable.
                    But, in any event, that was my conception. Now, on the other side, Carla Hills
                    was very nervous about that. She did not want to negotiate under a timetable,
                    because she said, “Well, we'll negotiate until we're finished. And when we're
                    finished, we'll be finished.” Her concern was giving people the impression that
                    we were going to cut corners in order to reach agreement. Now part of my
                    optimism was based on the fact that we already had a model, which was the
                    U.S.-Canada agreement. And we would basically bring Mexico into that
                    arrangement.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>There are two other things to cover in this pre-negotiation period. One was
                    Canada. The other was our consultations with the AFL-CIO. We knew that we had to
                    consult not only with the Congress, but with the private sector. Importantly,
                    Labor would be one of those, because we knew that Labor probably would be
                    somewhat antagonistic to this. We didn't really know how much. It was my task to
                    inform the AFL-CIO. So I telephoned Tom Donahue, who was the Treasurer of the
                    AFL-CIO. He was also Chairman of our Labor Advisory Committee, one of the many
                    public advisory committees that serve the USTR by statute. And I said, “Tom, I
                    want to tell you that we have been considering this, and the President has
                    decided that we are going forward, and I want you to know about this beforehand.
                    I hope we can work together on this.” He said, “Well, let me tell you. You know
                    we are going to oppose this.” I said, “Well, that doesn't surprise me, but
                    nonetheless, I still hope we can work together, and we'd still like to reflect
                    your interest and views to the maximum extent possible.” And he said, “Well,
                    there is a price.” And I said, “What is that?” And he said, “Adjustment
                    assistance.”</p>
                <p>Adjustment assistance is a program for compensating workers who lose their jobs
                    because of trade. It is a program that had languished over the course of a
                    decade or so, and labor wanted that program refurbished and renewed. I said,
                    “Tom, I'm on your side on that one. I think that is absolutely reasonable. I
                    don't know what we can do, but I'm certainly prepared to work with you on that.”
                    Well, despite that promising beginning, Labor subsequently decided they were
                    going to go all out to defeat it, and they certainly did try.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you believe that this Labor feeling a good chance to
                        sort of show some muscle? Because Labor had been languishing over time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: That is an interesting story that requires someone else to investigate.
                    Because something happened. My impression was that Tom Donahue was prepared to
                    bargain on this, realizing that he wasn't going to defeat it, but he wanted to
                    exercise maximum leverage. But somewhere between then and subsequently, the
                    decision went the other way. I've heard that it was a grass roots movement; that
                    some of the locals decided that they had to oppose it. The whole story about the
                    vehemence of the opposition to this, I think needs examination. A lot of it had
                    to do with the fact that it was Mexico. It was almost, I don't know if racial is
                    the right word, but ...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not quite racial, but almost social. A different culture,
                        second rate. Canada was one of us although the Canadians hate us the same
                        way.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>KATZ: I think it was sort of characterized by a Perot remark, which I used to
                    some advantage in a television interview sometime later, during the approval
                    process, where Perot said, “These are people who aspire to have indoor
                    plumbing.” It was that kind of looking down. So I think there was a lot of that.
                    And of course, there had been the experience with the maquiladora operations
                    along the border. This is a zone along the U.S.-Mexican border where companies
                    can operate as kind of a special customs area, where they can import duty-free,
                    and then export the products. A lot of this involved importing components from
                    the United States, assembling them in Mexico, and sending them back. Cheap
                    labor, in some cases poor working conditions, environmental degradation, and
                    that was part of the background too. At any event, we made our efforts with
                    Labor, but that didn't work out very well.</p>
                <p>Our discussions with our other advisory committees — basically the industrial,
                    and even the agricultural advisory committees went pretty well. I think they
                    were generally supportive, and in some cases enthusiastic.</p>
                <p>But then Canada came along. Canada had gotten wind of this, and they were very
                    apprehensive, because they saw this as a dilution of the benefits they had with
                    their agreement with us. About that time, there was an article written by a
                    Canadian economist, Ron Wonnacott, who used the term “hub-and-spoke.” He said
                    that what was happening was that there was evolving a hub and spoke
                    architecture, with the U.S. being the hub, and other bilateral partners being
                    spokes; the U.S. basically getting many benefits, and as you add more spokes,
                    each of the spokes receives lesser benefits. This got some attention in Canada,
                    and in any event, the issue went before the Canadian Cabinet. The Canadian
                    Ambassador here, who was Derek Burney, had raised the question with me. I said,
                    “Well, you cannot be serious in thinking about interposing an objection to our
                    doing an agreement with our third largest trading partner.” “No, no, it's not
                    that, but we're still concerned with the political problem in Canada.” And I
                    said, “Well, you've got a choice. You can ask to be included.” “ What would be
                    the reaction to that?” he asked. I said, “I don't know, but there is no reason
                    you can't ask.”</p>
                <p>Well, there was a split in the Canadian Cabinet, because they had gone through
                    something that looked like a rehearsal for our deliberations on NAFTA, with the
                    tables turned, with Canadians arguing that their economic interest would be
                    prejudiced, because the U.S. was much more competitive. Another argument was
                    that Canada would lose its sovereignty, that they would have to give up their
                    social security system, and that they would lose their economic independence.
                    This of course was an old story, but it was all exacerbated by the free-trade
                    agreement, and it became a white hot issue in Canada, culminating in the
                    Canadian parliamentary elections in 1988.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>Ten days before the elections I was in Canada, and met with a group of — I was
                    outside of the government then — Canadian Deputy Ministers, and they were all
                    very gloomy. They thought Mulroney was going down to defeat, and free trade was
                    going down to defeat, but Mulroney pulled it out, and won an almost landslide
                    victory. But still, there were people in this Cabinet that said, “Oh God, we
                    don”t want to go through this again. We don't want to have another debate on
                    free trade.” But ultimately, two ministers, John Crosby, who was the Trade
                    Minister, and Michael Wilson, who was the Finance Minister, argued very strongly
                    that they should come into the agreement, or rather that they should come into
                    the negotiations; they should seek participation in the negotiations and
                    ultimately Mulroney decided they should.</p>
                <p>Over Labor Day of 1990, President Bush was at Kennebunkport, and Brian Mulroney,
                    the Prime Minister of Canada, was his weekend guest. And he said, “George, we'd
                    like in on this negotiation.” So that started another debate within our
                    Administration, with some folks saying, we don't want the Canadians in this.
                    First of all, their up to no good, they are really seeking to frustrate the
                    negotiation with Mexico. They are going to be a problem. Canadians are very
                    difficult. A whole series of objections. And interestingly, many of these were
                    coming from the State Department. I argued on the other side of this, that we
                    couldn't exclude the Canadians. Moreover, I found objectionable the notion of
                    having two bilateral agreements. I didn't like the prospect of having many
                    bilateral agreements, because at heart I was, and remain a multilateralist. And
                    I saw these free-trade agreements as being not only an exception, but I saw the
                    possibility of harmonizing them with the multilateral system ultimately. But if
                    we had many separate bilateral agreements, you would have tremendous confusion
                    in our own trade relationships, but also in the trading system.</p>
                <p>Later on, in a somewhat different context, I took on this Ron Wonnacott metaphor
                    of hub and spoke, and I said the prospect we were facing was not hub and spoke,
                    but spaghetti. We had the prospect of many bilateral agreements by many
                    countries. And I used the phrase at a conference on the subject, and I had a
                    baseball cap made up which said, “NAFTA NOT PASTA.” I was arguing for the
                    extension of NAFTA to the Western Hemisphere, but not a series of bilateral
                    agreements.</p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>In any event, we had this all out within the Administration and then began
                    discussions with the Canadians. We asked,”What if we can't reach agreement?
                    Clearly, you're not going to be able to frustrate this negotiation with Mexico.”
                    And the Canadians said, “We have no interest in doing that.” So ultimately we
                    worked out an agreement with the Canadians and then a three-way agreement. The
                    Mexicans then became very nervous, also about having the Canadians in. Although,
                    interestingly one of the arguments against Canada from inside our Administration
                    was that it would be two against one. That we would face two adversaries instead
                    of one. I did not view it as that kind of negotiation, and in any event, we were
                    bigger than both of them together, and I thought that was a silly argument. You
                    didn't settle issues by majority voting, so that was kind of silly. But we
                    worked out with Canada an understanding that no one party could effectively
                    block the other two from proceeding. So if Canada decided that it could not
                    agree, then it would step aside. If we couldn't reach agreement with Mexico, of
                    course that would not prejudice the existing agreement.</p>
                <p>So by middle September it was decided that Canada would be a party to this, which
                    required an amendment to our fast-track notice to the Congress. This notice
                    period then had begun, and I said, “O.K., let's get to work, and start
                    exchanging information.” We had a couple of meetings, but it was clear that
                    nothing was really happening very fast. The Mexicans weren't really ready, and
                    something that was to bother, almost plague us over the next several months as
                    we got into the negotiations was that the Mexicans had never really done
                    anything like this, and were somewhat lacking in confidence and hesitant. Their
                    decision process went right up to the top, so it was slow.</p>
                <p>But then, of course came the intensification of work to try and finish the
                    Uruguay Round at the end of 1990, the Brussels Conference, so we were spending
                    more time on the Uruguay Round. The other thing that happened was that the
                    fast-track authority was expiring, effective March 2, 1991. The expiry date was
                    really June 1, but to execute an agreement we had to notify the Congress 90
                    calendar days in advance, so that would make it March 1 or 2. So we had to renew
                    fast-track, and what happened then, was that the fast-track debate became a
                    Mexico debate. Labor began to mount its campaign against it, and we spent just
                    about two months, three months almost, in an intensive lobbying campaign with
                    the Congress and the public to some extent, to get approval of the extension of
                    fast-track. And incidentally, this was not an affirmative vote. The way the law
                    read was that fast-track would continue unless the Congress voted against it. In
                    any event, there would be a vote by the Congress. So in that period, we really
                    accomplished none of those pre-negotiating objectives that I had intended. We
                    got very little work done in that period. The Mexicans weren't ready and we were
                    preoccupied. That lobbying effort was intensive, it ultimately succeeded, and by
                    early June we had our fast-track authority.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>We formally began the negotiations on June 12. We had our first ministerial
                    meeting in Toronto, where we agreed on the organization of the negotiation.
                    Basically the structure was three levels of negotiators. The three ministers at
                    the top were the ultimate authority. Then three chief negotiators beneath them,
                    that would have day-to-day responsibility for the negotiations. I was the U.S.
                    Chief Negotiator, John Weekes for Canada, Herminio Blanco for Mexico. Beneath
                    the chief negotiators, we had Deputy Chiefs and negotiating groups. We had 22
                    negotiating groups on all of the issues: tariffs, services, intellectual
                    property, travel, business travel, investment, energy, etc.</p>
                <p>The negotiations lasted 14 months to the day — we began on June 12 and concluded
                    on August 12. We had seven ministerial meetings and the Chiefs met 16 times in
                    various locations in North America. And of course the negotiating groups met
                    even more frequently, and for longer periods of time. The Ministers and the
                    Chiefs typically would meet for several days at a time, although toward the end
                    of the negotiations, the duration was longer and the end of the negotiation
                    lasted several weeks. There was a Chief's meeting that went for almost a week.
                    And then the Ministers came in and they met for 12 days and nights to finish the
                    negotiation. All through this process, we also felt it was very important to
                    carry out our consultation process and at the beginning of this, having in mind
                    previous experiences, I instructed my subordinates keep detailed records on the
                    meetings that were held. We had on the average one consultation a day with
                    somebody in the Congress, with a member or staff people, and four a day with the
                    private sector, with our advisory committee structure, which consisted of 1,000
                    public advisers. But additionally, with other associations, or anybody we could
                    identify that might have an interest.</p>
                <p>Among the groups we consulted with was the environmental community. One of the
                    issues that came up in the fast-track debate was that early in the debate,
                    Chairmen Benson and Rostenkowski sent us a joint letter, with a series of
                    questions on how we would address various questions and criticisms. And out of
                    that came a response that involved a number of commitments, things which we
                    would do with respect to labor and the environment. As to the environment, this
                    was a completely new subject to us; we had never dealt with this in a trade
                    agreement. As a result of our consultations with the environmental community,
                    what we did tactically was to divide the environmental movement between the
                    extremists, the bomb throwers, and the reasonable people. And out of that came
                    agreements, or an understanding of what we would seek to achieve in the
                    agreement. And in fact, for the first time ever, we put environmental provisions
                    into a trade agreement, the NAFTA.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Canadians feel about that? They used to
                        complaiabout us; were they enthusiastic, or did they find that it was also
                        inhibiting them too?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>KATZ: Well, they were a little concerned in some areas about how far we were
                    going to go, and of course the Mexicans were too. I should say also, again going
                    back to the fast-track consideration, that we worked out some understandings
                    with the Mexicans on labor and environment. There were some environmental
                    programs along the border, and there was a memorandum of understanding on labor
                    cooperation, which was less far-reaching than the environmental agreements. In
                    fact, in the environmental agreements we actually proposed putting some money
                    into cleanup.</p>
                <p>As a result of our continuing consultations, it was concluded that those
                    agreements we reached with Mexico in the spring of 1991 would not be sufficient,
                    so we put some other things in the NAFTA agreement. For example, we had some
                    hortatory language on the environment in the preamble, and we gave specific
                    recognition to four environmental treaties, which would be given precedence over
                    the NAFTA in the event of a conflict between the agreements. The environmental
                    community was complaining that trade interests were being put ahead of the
                    environment, and there had been a fisheries dispute where, in effect, it was
                    perceived that the GATT was going override the environmental agreement. So we
                    put a provision saying that with respect these four treaties and conventions,
                    that they would have priority over the NAFTA on any dispute. We could add other
                    international environmental agreements in the future.</p>
                <p>We also had a provision that said that no party would use waivers from
                    environmental laws in order to attract investment, which was an allegation that
                    was extant. We changed the provisions of an agreement that was being negotiated
                    in the Uruguay Round on sanitary measures, putting the burden of proof on the
                    defending party, as opposed to the plaintiff party, with respect to disputes
                    about such provisions. So we made a number of efforts to specifically recognize
                    environmental concerns. Of course, these were not enough to satisfy the
                    extremists in the environmental movement, but it did gain the support of some of
                    the responsible organizations.</p>
                <p>The other major issue to which I alluded earlier, and one of the particularly
                    difficult issues in the negotiation was over energy. Energy policy, and in
                    particular hydrocarbons or oil, had almost a mythological quality in Mexican
                    politics. I remember some experiences in the '70s with President Lopez Portillo
                    over gas exports from Mexico, where he described hydrocarbons as Mexico's
                    patrimony. The Mexicans took the position early on that energy policy was
                    inviolable, and couldn't be part of the agreement. We said, “Well, we understand
                    the special conditions, but energy policy could not be inviolable, and that this
                    was a comprehensive trade agreement, and must cover all of the elements of the
                    economy. We would try to work around the special conditions in Mexico, but we
                    couldn't just leave energy policy out. The Mexicans would not even admit
                    publicly that there was an energy negotiating group. I had a shouting match on
                    the telephone with Minister Serra, when Carla Hills was unavailable, because
                    there had been a press story about the deliberations of the energy group. He
                    threatened call off the negotiations unless I would deny that there was no such
                    group, which of course I refused to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>At the second Ministerial meeting in Seattle Serra came forward with a position
                    which became known as the “Four No's”: it was not possible to provide in the
                    agreement for exploration or production of hydrocarbons; it was not possible to
                    include transportation, primary petrochemicals, nor distribution. Neither
                    foreigners nor private parties could own gas stations. Throughout the
                    negotiations the Mexicans kept reminding us of the four no's, to the point where
                    my Deputy, Chip Roh, who was kind of a wag, and a bit of a cartoonist, drew a
                    cartoon with a face. At one meeting I kept hearing about the “No's,” and asked
                    where are ayes? What can we do? So Chip drew this cartoon of a face with a
                    bulbous nose, with little squinty eyes, with a caption which said, “All no's, no
                    ayes.” And this problem was to dog us throughout the negotiations. We finally
                    chipped away and we got an energy chapter in the agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the Canadians help in this type of thing? When the
                        Mexicans nationalized the oil industry in Mexico, this was one of the
                        crowning achievements of the revolution. So that in a way I would think that
                        the Canadians, being neutral in this without these pejorative feelings,
                        could come in and say, “Come on fellows, we're all doing this together.” Did
                        it work that way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: The Canadian role was kind of interesting, and it evolved over time. At the
                    very beginning, the Canadians were very passive. I think they saw their role and
                    their mission as being defensive. They were supposed to defend what already
                    existed in the bilateral agreement. As we went on and we had U.S.-Mexico
                    problems, the Canadians would occasionally try to be helpful. But through much
                    of it they were really on the sidelines. As we got to the end of the
                    negotiations, there were a number of provisions that directly impinged on
                    Canadian interests. In fact, there were provisions and issues that touched on
                    the existing bilateral agreement, such as investment policy and cultural policy,
                    where the Canadians became very active. And then agriculture policy, which was
                    another very tough issue, that I will come to later.</p>
                <p>One of the problems on energy was that this was an important issue in the U.S.-
                    Canada Agreement. One of the concessions we got out of the Canadians was that
                    they would not use export controls against us in an emergency, as they did in
                    the 1974 energy crisis. That was hard fought, and hard won, and became a bit of
                    a political issue in Canada. The Mexicans would not agree to anything similar.
                    The Canadians then became very concerned that if the Mexicans would not agree,
                    this again would become a political issue in Canada. And in fact, it did, when
                    the Chretien government came in. Separately Chretien had said that they were
                    going to tear up the agreement if they were elected to office. Then he said he
                    would change it, and when he came into office he talked about it, and then there
                    was a meeting with Clinton and they sort of swept it under the rug. But in any
                    event, this was a legitimate concern by the Canadians, and a concern on our
                    part, that if we acceded to the Mexican reluctance to agree on supply in an
                    emergency, that this would put the Canadians in an impossible position and we
                    would lose this benefit with Canada.</p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>One of the evidences of this extreme paranoia on the part of Mexico over energy,
                    was a provision they insisted on in the preamble to the energy chapter. The
                    first sentence, which reads something like, “Each of the parties express their
                    respect for their respective constitutions...” And that really stuck in my
                    throat, and I said, “Come on now, you can't be serious.” And they said, “We
                    absolutely must have this sentence.” And I said, “Well, is there any question
                    that about each of us respecting our own constitutions? But implying that we
                    respect other peoples constitutions goes too far.” The Mexicans were insistent
                    on the provision and insistent that it go into the energy chapter. I said,
                    “Well, if it goes any place, put it in the preamble the whole agreement.” “No,
                    no, no,” they said, “it had to be in the energy chapter.” I said, “This is
                    really silly the point of being childish.” “Listen,”they said, “trust us. This
                    is something we absolutely need for our own politics.” In the end, Carla said,
                    “What the hell.” So we went along with it.</p>
                <p>Another major issue was agriculture. This was an issue primarily with Canada.
                    Canada would not agree, as they were not agreeing in the Uruguay Round, to give
                    up what was called supply management of dairy and poultry. That is, to have
                    quotas on imports of dairy and poultry products. I, said to them, both in the
                    NAFTA and the Uruguay Round, “Look, in the end you know you're going have give
                    this up, because this is going be the price for the Uruguay Round Agreement.”
                    And privately, some Canadians said “Of course we will. In the end we will not
                    stand in the way of this. But we just can't do it now.” And the reason they
                    couldn't do it, was that these products were produced in Quebec, so it was part
                    of the Quebec issue. But they were absolutely unwilling to agree to this.</p>
                <p>So in the end, we had a period of a serious questioning whether Canada would
                    remain in the NAFTA negotiations. We said we were not prepared have an agreement
                    without agriculture. Of course, in the U.S.-Canada agreement, the provision was
                    that all tariffs would be eliminated. The quotas could be maintained. They had
                    theirs, and we had some on our side. But in the Uruguay Round they were going to
                    disappear, and we wouldn't agree to that formulation in the NAFTA. Mexico didn't
                    have quotas and they didn't want any either. By then, they had gotten rid of
                    their agriculture quotas. So ultimately, what was decided was that Canada would
                    be excluded from the agriculture part of the NAFTA. So the NAFTA covers
                    everything except agriculture, where in effect, there are three bilateral
                    agreements: U.S.-Canada; U.S.-Mexico; Canada-Mexico. This is one of the
                    shortcomings in the agreement.</p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>An interesting consequence of that, not so much of that, but of the U.S.-Canada
                    agreement, was something we saw coming. In fact, the Canadians had raised it
                    with us. They said, “Now, if we ever agree to eliminate the quotas through
                    tariffication in the Uruguay Round, we will have a problem with the FTA, the
                    bilateral agreement, because that requires that all tariffs be at zero. And of
                    course the elimination of quotas would mean substitution, conversion of tariffs.
                    So we would have a problem.” And I said, “Indeed you will. But are you prepared
                    to talk about tariffication?” And they said, “No, we can't agree to discuss
                    tariffication.” And I said, “Well, then, there is nothing to talk about.” So we
                    never did talk about it. And then ultimately, and not surprisingly, Canadians
                    had to agree to tariffication in the Uruguay Round. They have to eliminate their
                    quotas. They've substituted very high tariffs for those quotas. And now there's
                    a problem under the Free Trade Agreement. It is now going to dispute settlement,
                    the U.S. is bringing a case against Canada for violation of the agreement.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did by any chance while you were doing this whole thing,
                        look at this as a model agreement that could be used? Was this really your
                        objective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Absolutely. We had in mind, first of all, producing as good an agreement, I
                    mean as close to perfection as possible. We knew it would be well short of
                    perfection, because there were inevitable exceptions, not only on agriculture,
                    but on investment policy and culture in Canada. And we had some exceptions on
                    our side, on investment policy. The Mexicans, of course had their exceptions on
                    energy and investment.</p>
                <p>But the other thing that happened was that in 1991, President Bush delivered a
                    speech on hemispheric policy, and it became entitled The Enterprise for the
                    Americas, where he laid out a policy which invited free trade agreements in the
                    hemisphere. We had a vigorous bureaucratic argument about that. Again, there was
                    this view in the State Department, Bob Zoellick, primarily, and also shared in
                    the Treasury and Commerce Departments, that we should negotiate bilateral
                    free-trade agreements with everybody. And I thought that we should seek to do it
                    with large countries, or groups of countries, that is, we should encourage
                    subregional integration in the hemisphere. What ultimately came out of it was
                    compromise language that we are prepared to do agreements with countries or
                    groups of countries. I can't remember the exact language, but the implication
                    was that it would be with large countries or groups of countries, even though it
                    didn't say large countries. My concern was the State Department would then use
                    this as a political prize. And in fact the question came up of doing a
                    free-trade agreement with Panama, which I thought was ridiculous.</p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>That was the beginnings of discussions of free-trade agreement with Chile. The
                    other point that was made in the President's Enterprise for the Americas speech
                    was that we are prepared to enter into these agreements with other countries,
                    but our first priority was the Uruguay Round and the completion of an agreement
                    with Mexico. So this was June of 1991. But for that reason, you are very right,
                    that we did have in mind that Mexico was going to be a precedent, and we wanted
                    it to be a good agreement. Ultimately it turned out to be a very fine agreement.
                    Trade policy experts around the world agree that it is a good agreement, with
                    some exceptions, primarily the rules of origin.</p>
                <p>There are two rules of origin, which people have taken issue with. They are bad
                    examples, although I think they are not terribly important. They are on
                    automobiles and textiles. They are restrictive. On textiles there is something
                    that is called double or triple transformation. Typically a rule of origin will
                    require a transformation from one stage of production to another. In the case of
                    textiles it isn't enough to be the fabric of a NAFTA country. It has to be the
                    fiber; U.S. fiber or North American fiber. In some speeches after the
                    negotiations were completed I facetiously said that it wasn't true as some
                    people had alleged that woolens have to be the fiber of sheep that have spent at
                    least three generations in the United States. But it was pretty restrictive. On
                    the other hand, the volume of our imports from the world are so large I don't
                    think this is a serious impediment.</p>
                <p>Similarly with respect to automobiles, the requirement is 62 percent value added
                    as defined in the agreement, which is very high. Normally it is 50 percent value
                    added. But given the volume of our imports in the United States, cars from
                    Japan, I didn't think that was a serious criticism. The question is now why is
                    it 62 and not 61 or 63, or 60? The reason is because it's between 60 and 65. And
                    because of the insistence of the auto industry, we sought 65. The Canadians were
                    the primarily protagonist. The Mexicans supported them, but not all that
                    vigorously. The Canadians were willing to go to 60, and we ultimately
                    compromised on 62.</p>
                <p>This led Red Poling, the CEO of Ford, to scream “sellout.” And the night that we
                    concluded the negotiations Carla telephoned him to say that we got 62, and he
                    began to scream, and Carla finally said, “Well, you talk to Jules Katz.” So he
                    got on the phone and said, “You know, this is absolutely unacceptable. We said
                    65 and we mean 65.” And I said, “Mr. Poling, I don't understand what you are
                    saying. It's just incredible to me that you are making this fuss over three
                    percentage points on a tariff that is 2 percent. The MFN rate for automobiles is
                    2 percent.” “Well, it's a matter of principle,” he said. And I said, “Well, I'm
                    sorry Mr. Poling, but we're dealing with a very practical circumstance and
                    that's the way it is going to be.” So we got blasted on both sides, although the
                    other companies weren't as strident about it. But this is part of the last
                    minute complications.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it's also a bit of the theater, isn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0132" n="Page0132"/>
                <p>KATZ: Oh, he was dead serious about it. In fact, I was in a subsequent meeting
                    with him where I debated him on this point. He was not quite as strident, and
                    everyone else smiled. I had to hold back from ridiculing him.</p>
                <p>Well, there are a lot of other little side-bars in the negotiations. The
                    investment provisions were very difficult with Mexico, and then ultimately with
                    Canada. But to be fair, the U.S. had some exceptions on things where we had
                    provisions of law on such things as maritime on which the U.S. took an exception
                    and on ownership of airlines and ownership of telecommunications and radio and
                    television stations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We felt these were essential our national defense?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: No, it was pure politics. We weren't prepared to take on everybody in the
                    country in the legislative process. We knew we would have a difficult enough
                    task — more difficult, it turned out even than we had suspected.</p>
                <p>I would make one other overall comment, and that is that I started out by talking
                    about how skeptical I was about how far the Mexicans were prepared to go, and I
                    was wrong about that. The Mexicans were prepared to go farther than I had
                    suspected. But I think in the end they went farther than they had believed they
                    would have to go. Their policies and approach really evolved through the
                    negotiation.</p>
                <p>One of the things I came to admire greatly was the approach of Minister Serra,
                    who was really a major figure. He, like many of our Mexican counterparts was
                    highly intelligent, a Pd.D. economist. I think his Pd.D. came from Yale. He had
                    taught at Stanford. An extremely bright man; extremely volatile too. He could
                    blow up frequently. But typically his approach to an issue would be say, “Well,
                    wait a minute. Let me understand it. Why is this important to you?” And he would
                    listen, and say, “O.K., I understand, but let's see if we can't find another
                    solution.” There were innumerable occasions when he approached matters in that
                    fashion.</p>
                <p>All of the Mexicans on their team were very bright. They tended to be young, they
                    were not terribly experienced, either in trade agreements, or even in
                    negotiations. Many of them had been recruited from universities and banks for
                    this negotiation. So they were really going into it as on the job training, as
                    it were, while conducting the negotiations. And that, in part, accounted for
                    what I impatiently regarded as delay. But with it all, we produced an agreement
                    that was 2,000 pages in length in 14 months, covering every aspect of the
                    economy. I think that was a pretty impressive job.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0133" n="Page0133"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I have heard in other interviews, although I've never
                        dealt with Mexicans, that in the Mexican government the Foreign Ministry has
                        been turned over almost to the anti-Americans, whereas most of the other
                        ministries, like the Ministry of Finance, are people who are used dealing
                        with the Americans all the time. Did you get any feeling about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes. I have had that experience in the past. I certainly had that
                    experience in the late 1970s, when I negotiated with the Mexicans on energy
                    policy. The interesting thing in this negotiation is that the Foreign Office
                    played no role. This negotiation was conducted primarily by SECOFI, which is the
                    Trade Ministry. But at a very early stage, in fact, even in the preliminary
                    stage at that August 1, 1990 meeting in Los Angeles, Serra said, “One thing I
                    want make clear: I have the primary responsibility within the Mexican government
                    for this negotiation. Who will be my counterpart? Will you, Carla, be my
                    counterpart?” And that was agreed. Now they drew on the other agencies, but
                    where issues developed with the other agencies, it was clear that Serra was in
                    charge. Serra would go to President Salinas if there was an issue. And within
                    our government, we ran the negotiation.</p>
                <p>I must say, the only real problems we ever really had, were with the State
                    Department, and that was with Bob Zoellick. There were a number of occasions
                    where the Mexicans tried to do end-runs, notwithstanding Serra's one-stop
                    shopping approach, with the Chief of Staff of President Salinas. There were a
                    number of times when he did end-runs when he would go to Bob Zoellick and
                    complain about me or about our positions. Bob Zoellick being the Under Secretary
                    for Economic Affairs and the Counselor of the State Department. He was pretty
                    discrete, making clear he wasn't going to interfere in the negotiations, but why
                    was it we were taking this unreasonable position? Carla was probably more
                    irritated by those events than I was. But with the rest of the government, we
                    really had very few difficulties. Our team was made up from many agencies of the
                    government. These 22 negotiating groups were in many cases led by people from
                    other agencies of the government: Commerce, Treasury, State Department, Labor —
                    those were the primary agencies.</p>
                <p>There was one particular meeting which was noteworthy that I might describe. That
                    was in February 1992, after we'd started these negotiations in June, and had
                    meetings in July and August. There was a period of several months when we were
                    doing a lot of exchanging of information on tariffs and regulations and so
                    forth.</p>
                <p>In my effort to speed the negotiations along, I wanted the drafting process to
                    start right away, so it was agreed in September or early October, that we would
                    actually start drafting chapters. And the three delegations went off and wrote
                    chapters individually, and then they came back in December. And then there was a
                    meeting at the Deputy Chief level and lawyers, primarily, that set about to take
                    the three versions and put it into one document. So in some cases you had
                    chapters that consisted of three versions of a chapter sequentially. But they
                    then began trying to take out words and merge paragraphs, to begin to produce
                    this document, even while the issues were still being discussed. That was part
                    of the process also, of identifying issues.</p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>It became clear that these negotiating groups were negotiating individually, and
                    we the chief negotiators had some difficulty in getting our arms around the
                    process. So we decided on a meeting where we would have everybody together at
                    one place at one time, which was kind of a big enterprise. We had separately had
                    a political problem with various communities along the border, that wanted to be
                    the location of NAFTA, and there was a group of people in Dallas, who were very
                    aggressive; very purposeful I should say, but also aggressive, saying that
                    Dallas was going to be the Secretariat of NAFTA. We said there wasn't going to
                    be a Secretariat in any one place. “Well, never mind, but we insist on this.” So
                    they sent a delegation, consisting of Mayor Bartlett, to see me, to make this
                    pitch. “We want to have the negotiations in Dallas.” “Well,” I said, “We have
                    these meetings in various places, and people are meeting all the time, sometimes
                    in capitals, sometimes in other places. We will have some meetings there.”</p>
                <p>But we decided we needed to have this big meeting, and the question was where
                    could we have it? And Dallas stepped right up and said, “Hey, we'll do it.” And
                    we said, “Well, it's going be pretty big.” And they said, “No problem.” They
                    gave us the top floor of the Design Center in Dallas, which is a big vacant
                    floor where they put up temporary partitions and they provided hotels and
                    arranged with American Airlines to provide discount fares and put on social
                    events, which we tried to avoid. But we finally had to agree to have a breakfast
                    and a banquet. In all, they put up about $500,000.00 for this meeting. And I
                    don't know how we would have done it otherwise. Then of course, I got into
                    trouble with the ranking member of the Ways and Means Committee, Mr. Archer, who
                    came from Houston. He was pretty agitated. He is now the Chairman of the
                    Committee. Fortunately it hasn't affected my long-term relationship with
                    him.</p>
                <p>Altogether we had about 400 people at that conference from the three governments,
                    with about 120 from the U.S. But that was a milestone in the negotiations,
                    because that was the first time we really began to start dealing with issues and
                    resolve issues, and identify others. But we began to narrow the issues to the
                    point where we could begin to see thousands of issues, not tens of thousands of
                    issues. The process was that the negotiating groups would meet. They would then
                    report to the Chiefs and say “Well, here are the problems we have in our
                    chapter.” And then the Chiefs, with some subordinates, would then discuss them,
                    try find areas of agreement, and that would be incorporated, and where we
                    couldn't we'd set it aside and say, “O.K., here's where we have some ongoing
                    problems.” And that was a week-long meeting, from Sunday to Saturday morning, a
                    milestone in the negotiations.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the role of President Bush? Did he say,
                        “do it,” and then get out of the way?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>KATZ: Yes, that was basically his style. But there were a few occasions — we
                    reported to him constantly — but there were some issues we brought to him. On
                    the energy issue, there was one meeting somewhere along the border, where he met
                    with Salinas and Bob Mosbacher was present. Salinas raised the energy issue, and
                    the President agreed that we would be respectful or sensitive on the energy
                    issue. The Mexicans interpreted it one way, and we interpreted it another way.
                    But in the end, he was less involved in it than he was in the Uruguay Round, for
                    example, where he became much more involved in specific issues, namely the
                    agriculture issue. There were very many issues that were extremely difficult. It
                    was a matter of constantly working the issues. In February we had thousands of
                    issues and in May in Mexico City we had maybe one thousand issues and when we
                    got to the Watergate in July we had hundreds of issues. In the last several days
                    we had about 150 issues, then 50, then 25, and then 4 in the last hour, and then
                    finally resolved those.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You came up with an agreement. But you had left before the
                        big battle in the public came about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: What happened was, we reached agreement at 12:40 am on August 12, 1992.
                    Then there was a period of fine tuning the text. The text had to conform to the
                    agreements, and it had to have legal scrubbing. And that went on for weeks and
                    weeks and in fact, it ended up being months. But our target was to initial and
                    sign the agreement. I believe the initialing was on October 7th in San Antonio.
                    There was a ceremonial initialing of the agreement with the three Ministers, the
                    three Heads of Government standing behind them, and a lot of private sector
                    people. The agreement was ultimately signed on December 7, because there was
                    another 60 day waiting period. There was no formal ceremony for the signing;
                    that was really anticlimactic. But then we left office.</p>
                <p>President Clinton had been somewhat ambivalent in the campaign. I shouldn't say
                    ambivalent, he was really quiet on the subject. And there was a certain amount
                    of goading from the Bush campaign, saying what is Clinton going to do about
                    NAFTA? He's ducking the issue. Finally, late in August, or early September, he
                    made a speech in North Carolina in which he endorsed the Agreement, but said
                    that there were a number of issues that would have to be dealt with to make it
                    acceptable to him, basically on labor and environmental issues. And some issues
                    that were covered in the agreement, which he didn't seem to realize. In fact,
                    someone told me later that they told him that the provision was in the
                    agreement, but he said never mind, he was going to say it anyway. (A safeguard
                    provision that was already in the agreement.)</p>
                <pb facs="0136" n="Page0136"/>
                <p>Then came the election, and he came into office. The Administration then set
                    about to negotiate some side agreements with the Mexicans primarily, but also
                    with the Canadians on labor and environmental provisions. And that was a long,
                    extended process. That lasted until August. It was a rather bitter negotiation.
                    The Mexicans were very unhappy with Mickey Kantor, in particular, over this. But
                    finally that was done, and then the question was getting this through the
                    Congress. Opposition was building all this time. Even though I was out of the
                    government then, I was fairly active in terms of making speeches in support of
                    the agreement; a lot of television appearances. And then Ross Perot got into the
                    act too. But the President really delayed and delayed, and then finally he got
                    into it, and that made the difference in terms of mobilizing the support. Of
                    course, the key event was the Gore-Perot debate, and interestingly, in May of
                    that year, I proposed to the business coalition supporting the agreement that
                    Perot be challenged to a debate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying coalition. What coalition was this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: This was a business coalition in support of NAFTA. I think it was called
                    “NAFTA Now.” It was primarily led by the Business Round table and some other
                    business organizations were working for it. But I called the NAFTA coalition,
                    and said, “You”ve got to get somebody to challenge Perot to a debate. You can
                    murder him. He obviously doesn't know what he's talking about. He's
                    inconsistent.” In fact, when he appeared before the Congress, they said, “Mr.
                    Perot, you don't like this agreement.” And he said, “No, that's not true. I
                    believe in the agreement. I just think it needs to be changed.” They said,
                    “Well, how would you change it?” He said, “I hadn't thought about it.” So the
                    Coalition people said, “Who would you get to debate him? Would Carla Hills do
                    it?” I said, “Well, I don't think she's the right person. I think you need to
                    get someone more in the political arena. What about Senator Bill Bradley from
                    New Jersey?” “Well, let us look into that.” And then I called Bradley's office.
                    In fact, I had talked to Bradley earlier. I had appeared with Bradley before an
                    audience. So I called this contact and I said, “Do you think the Senator would
                    go for this? You may hear about this, because I've stimulated this possibility.”
                    They thought he might very well agree to it. I heard nothing further, and
                    nothing happened.</p>
                <p>Incidentally, my activities in this regard were somewhat limited, because I'd
                    gone into business with Carla Hills, and we decided that we were not going to do
                    lobbying as such, that we would not do lobbying in the literal sense of the
                    term. But we could speak out as public citizens, which is what we did, and on
                    request met with members of Congress. So my role was active, but limited in that
                    regard. But then, suddenly Gore volunteered to debate Perot, and a lot of
                    nervousness prevailed. I was somewhat nervous about Gore doing this, because I
                    wondered if he had the personality.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0137" n="Page0137"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He has sort of a wooden delivery, for those that don't
                        know it. He does look like he's wound up. It's funny.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: That”s right. But he was equal to the task, and he destroyed Perot. That
                    was a major turning point. And the other thing that happened that I thought was
                    a major turning point was a week before the vote, the President kind of took the
                    gloves off, and he took exception to the campaign by Labor. He directly
                    criticized labor for the vicious campaign that they were waging. That kind of
                    provided a shield for some people in the Congress who were a little nervous
                    about taking on Labor themselves.</p>
                <p>All through this, I have to say that I felt that we would win, until about the
                    last four days or so, because the Administration was doing a lot of wheeling and
                    dealing. They had promised, for example, one Congressman that they would have a
                    development bank along the border, that became the NAD Bank, the North American
                    Development Bank. And the word was, “Well, that got his vote.” So one bank, one
                    vote. And obviously there weren't enough banks to get 218 votes in the House. We
                    knew that the Senate would not be a problem; the problem was in the House. But,
                    it began to turn around on the weekend before. By Monday it was pretty clear we
                    were going to win. I think the vote was Tuesday or Wednesday, and of course we
                    won fairly big. We won with 236 votes in favor. The Senate vote was
                    anticlimactic, so it came about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Should we turn some other things now? We'll pick this up
                        the next time, and we're going talk about Russia, the importance of
                        intelligence toward negotiation, the work of embassies, Commerce, and one
                        other one that came to me that you might think about in between was, you
                        were over this a long period of time, about 40 years off and on, on various
                        types of negotiations. Did you see a change in negotiating style, or
                        negotiators, as far as Americans are concerned, or other people? Something
                        to think about.</hi>

                        Negotiating and dealing with Russia, particularly when it was going through
                        its time of turmoil. Compare and contrast.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: After I had left Eastern European Affairs in 1963, I had not dealt with the
                    Russians for a very long time. It was from about the 1950s until I encountered
                    them again in the late 1980s. I remember one meeting I had with a young Russian.
                    I'm not sure what his status was. I think he was here on a fellowship. I was at
                    the time working at the Government Research Corporation, which was a consulting
                    firm, and he somehow got my name and came to see me about the GATT. He was doing
                    some research on the GATT, and I was curious about this. I said, “Surely you're
                    not thinking that the Soviet Union might try to accede to the GATT.” He said,
                    “Well, you never know. We just want to know what would be involved.”</p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>That was sort of the first clue that I had of some fresh thinking about the role
                    of the Soviet Union in the world economy. He did say, “Surely, we would not be
                    eligible at this point. That is, our economy would not be suitable. But you just
                    don't know how things will develop, and we're trying to do some thinking about
                    this.” He was not with the government, I don't believe, at least not formally.
                    He was with one of the research institutes over there.</p>
                <p>When I took office in USTR, in 1989, I had to go to Moscow in late 1989 for an
                    annual review under a so-called grains arrangement. This was an agreement that
                    went back to 1963, when the Russians had a very poor harvest. Not the first, but
                    one of many. But that was a particularly acute situation, and it was at the
                    early Kennedy Administration, and the Russians wanted to buy wheat from the U.S.
                    We had a ridiculous policy in force, which went back to the Eisenhower
                    administration. The policy provided that we would not sell or subsidize the sale
                    of agricultural commodities to the Soviet Union. During the Eisenhower
                    Administration, the Russians had asked to buy some butter, and after much
                    deliberation, the Secretary of Commerce at the time, came out of a meeting at
                    the White House, and announced that we would not subsidize the Soviet housewife.
                    Well, that's perfectly ridiculous, of course. What we were subsidizing were our
                    own farmers.</p>
                <p>An opportunity to sell some surplus groceries should have been welcomed. If we
                    could sell them at world prices and recover some of our budgetary losses, we
                    should have welcomed the opportunity to do so. But, that policy stayed in effect
                    until 1963. And then there was a lot of toing and froing about changing the
                    policy; there a lot of angst in the Administration, again, for reasons I can
                    hardly understand. But finally, Kennedy made the decision that we would sell
                    them grain. But in the political deliberations and trying to get support for
                    this, the labor unions entered the picture.</p>
                <p>In any event, a condition was laid down that the Russians could buy wheat in the
                    United States, but they had to ship a large part of it on American flag ships.
                    That came about almost as an accident, I think, because Tommy Thompson, who had
                    been one of the legendary American Ambassadors to the Soviet Union, one of a
                    group of foreign service officers who specialized in the Soviet Union — Chip
                    Bohlen, Tommy Thompson, George Kennan — a number of people who were early
                    Sovietologists, was, at the time an Ambassador-at-Large in the Department and he
                    was asked to undertake discussions with the Soviets. He had several meetings
                    with Ambassador Dobrynin, and he was asked to put this question to Dobrynin
                    about how were they going to ship this wheat? Dobrynin said, “Well, on ships of
                    course.” He didn't really understand the question. And then Tommy said, “Would
                    you be willing to carry the wheat on American vessels?” He replied, “Well, it
                    doesn't make any difference. We just want the wheat.”</p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>Thompson reported back, and the immediate question we in the Economic Bureau had
                    — and I had just then moved the Economic Bureau, since I had previous experience
                    with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, I was brought into this discussion — I
                    immediately asked did he understand that the cost of American shipping was about
                    twice what it is for foreign shipping? And Thompson said, “Well, I'm sure he
                    does. The Russians are not unsophisticated people. He must know this.” Well, we
                    were unpersuaded, and had him go back again. And, of course, there was a
                    problem.</p>
                <p>The final deal was that they would ship half on American bottoms and we then
                    effectively subsidized the differential cost. This agreement then took effect
                    and it stayed in effect for at least until 1989, and then it was a matter of
                    renewing it annually. So I went over to Moscow for this negotiation. It also
                    involved required minimum purchase commitments by the Russians. The theory was
                    that since we agree to supply them with wheat, they should also agree that they
                    would buy minimum quantities. But in fact, they were buying much more than the
                    commitment, so it was kind of a meaningless agreement.</p>
                <p>In any event, this gave me a brief view of Moscow in the late '80s. It was as
                    dismal as I had remembered it from earlier visits. It wasn't really clear to me
                    — I was only there several days — the extent to which it was falling apart. But
                    it was clearly about as bad as any third world country. Things just didn't work,
                    except for the modern new airport which had been built by the Germans. That I
                    found kind of impressive. I had an experience with a young Russian at the time,
                    who was from the protocol part of the Foreign Office, who, on my departure, gave
                    me VIP treatment in a special lounge. I had to wait a while for my flight. I
                    fell into conversation with him, which was rather interesting. He was talking
                    about conditions there, and how, in visiting his family in Leningrad, it was
                    almost impossible to get airline reservations unless you knew somebody who knew
                    somebody. His aspiration was to get a foreign assignment, because it was so
                    difficult living in Moscow. So it was clear there was a lot of unhappiness.</p>
                <p>The other thing I remember about the Soviet Union, and this was a little earlier,
                    probably in 1988, I had lunch with former Secretary William Rogers. I had seen
                    him earlier in the '80s on some legal business involving the firm that I was
                    with at the time. He had invited me to lunch to talk about possibly doing some
                    work together on a case in London involving some commodity trading on the London
                    Metal Exchange. But in the course of talking about the Soviet Union, Gorbachev
                    at the time was in office, and glasnost and perestroika were at their
                    beginnings. He said, “What do you think about what's going on over there?” “Do
                    you think the openings are reversible?” I said, “It looks like there are some
                    serious changes that are going on there. I'm not quite sure they are going to go
                    back to where they were before.”</p>
                <pb facs="0140" n="Page0140"/>
                <p>Rogers said, “Well, let me tell you a little story.” Earlier in the spring, he
                    was in Moscow, with some of the old boys, Callaghan of the U.K., Helmut Schmidt
                    of Germany, and Giscard D'Estaing of France. They had a meeting with Gromyko,
                    who was then still President. This was something like April, and then in June at
                    the Party Congress, resigned as President. But he was still President at the
                    time, and after exchanging pleasantries, Gromyko said, “Well, what would you
                    like to talk about?” And they said, “Well, tell us what's going on here? There
                    seem be some interesting things going on in your country.” And according to
                    Rogers, Gromyko said, “Well, it's very simple. We have come to a point in our
                    history where we can no longer feed, clothe, or house our people. Something has
                    got to change.” This was Gromyko, the old Bolshevik. I was never quite sure he
                    was actually a Bolshevik. He may have been a little young for that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But he was the Ambassador at the very end of the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: He was Ambassador here. He was Ambassador of course, to the United Nations
                    at its beginnings. He was Foreign Minister for a long time. He was sort of a
                    stony faced, hard line Soviet Communist. So that was kind of a revelation. And
                    in this affair in 1989 on grains, as I dealt with the Russians, they certainly
                    seemed different from the people I had known before. They were not quite as
                    hard, somewhat easier to deal with.</p>
                <p>Then in 1990, it was decided that we would negotiate a trade agreement with the
                    Soviet Union. Now, we had a law on the books that went back 1974, the so-called
                    Jackson-Vanik amendment, which prohibited the extension of most-favored-nation
                    tariff treatment unless the President certified that there was an immigration
                    policy which was reasonably open. Most favored nation treatment had been denied
                    to the Soviet Union and communist countries after 1951 when there was a change
                    in U.S. law. Until that time, we had an unconditional most favored nation
                    treatment with all countries. But it was taken away from the Soviet Union and
                    the other communist states in 1951, except for Yugoslavia. It was restored to
                    Poland in 1959, and then taken away again once in the 1980s. But in any event,
                    for the Soviet Union, the problem was Jackson-Vanik. By 1990, of course, there
                    was no problem on immigration. People were leaving pretty freely.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>The other problem was that we had to have a trade agreement. There was an attempt
                    at an agreement in the Nixon administration, in 1972. In fact, there was a trade
                    agreement negotiated at that time, but it never came into effect because of the
                    Jackson-Vanik problem. But in 1990, I then initiated these negotiations with the
                    Soviets, and a delegation came to Washington. We presented them with a text,
                    which was a rather lengthy text, dealing with a whole lot of questions that were
                    very strange to the Soviets, such as the protection of intellectual property,
                    patents, and copyrights, and provisions on exchange controls, commercial
                    representation. There were a whole lot of things. The head of their delegation
                    was a man named Chumikov, who was a Deputy Minister for International Trade. He
                    didn't quite know what to make of this. And he said, “Mr. Katz, I came over here
                    for a trade agreement. You give me this document — I don't know what do with
                    it.”</p>
                <p>We had a series of meetings. I believe we met in February of 1990, and then we
                    met again in Paris, and in Vienna, and I think probably once more in Washington.
                    We reached agreement. We had some people go to Moscow on technical issues,
                    particularly intellectual property, which was pretty difficult for the Soviets.
                    But in the end, we produced the agreement. There was one hiccup there: I believe
                    it was before the Paris meeting, the Russians sent some troops into the Baltic.
                    There was a question as to whether we would have that meeting. I didn't really
                    know until the last minute whether we would have the meeting. But we did, and
                    other than that, the negotiations themselves were remarkably smooth compared to
                    my previous dealings with the Soviets. And then in June 1990, it was signed at a
                    ceremony at the White House, where a whole series of agreements were signed.</p>
                <p>That night, I gave a dinner for the two delegations, and had some interesting
                    conversations with Mr. Chumikov. He was very pleased with the whole affair, and
                    he said, “Mr. Katz, when you gave me that agreement at first, I didn't know what
                    you were doing. But you know, this is the best agreement I've ever negotiated.
                    It's the best agreement we ever concluded.” And we talked about the changes that
                    were going on in the Soviet Union. Things were happening very rapidly by then
                    and he was not quite sure what to make of all of that.</p>
                <p>At one point in the conversation, he said, “You know, people compare the Soviet
                    Union to Poland. But it's completely different. We have a different kind of
                    population, no sense of discipline. You know, Stalin did some bad things. But he
                    was really a very clever man. And the country really worked under Stalin. Then
                    came Brezhnev, and Brezhnev was a disaster. When Brezhnev came, everything fell
                    apart. Discipline completely collapsed and we had chaos.” He was kind of
                    reminiscing for old Joe Stalin. The last I heard of Chumikov, he was a sugar
                    trader. He was trading sugar for a private business. That was kind of an
                    interesting end to it all.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like there was an earth change in the way the
                        Soviets negotiated, because before, from what I understand, was that they
                        would basically say no to everything until the last minute.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0142" n="Page0142"/>
                <p>KATZ: Basically, there was not a whole lot of imagination. It was all kind of
                    scripted. They had formal positions which they read and reread, and only at the
                    last minute would they yield grudgingly. There was no effort to solve problems
                    in the way other negotiations are held. You confront a problem, and the two
                    negotiators say, well, O.K., I understand your position, and you understand my
                    position. Now how are we going to solve this? Where are the areas where we can
                    find agreement? What if we do this, or change this dynamic or variable? That was
                    very difficult with the Soviets.</p>
                <p>What was interesting about this trade negotiation, was that it was not just the
                    dynamic between Chumikov and myself. Some of the other people on the delegation
                    — my people were able to deal with their counterparts on the Soviet side,
                    particularly in the intellectual property area, which was kind of difficult for
                    them, because they did not have anything like world class law, on patents or
                    copyrights. </p>
                <p>Copyrights were especially difficult for them. So it was a matter of
                    conceptualizing and innovating as they went along. The character of the people
                    was changing. These were younger people. Not altogether — an interesting thing
                    about intellectual property is that there was a professor that they had borrowed
                    from one of the universities, who had apparently done research on this. He
                    became rather important in this negotiation. He was also a bit of a wheeler
                    dealer and that was a complete change in character from negotiations that went
                    way back.</p>
                <p>I had heard stories about the disarmament negotiations, where some of that went
                    on as well, where there were differences between the Foreign Ministry people and
                    the defense establishment. And to some extent, the U.S. Defense Department
                    dealing with their counterparts, and the Foreign Office people were dealing with
                    theirs. This is obviously not something that happened overnight, it obviously
                    had evolved over the decades.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving to another subject, have we talked about the
                        Chinese at all? Did you have any dealings with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0143" n="Page0143"/>
                <p>KATZ: Not very much, and I've really had very little experience with the Chinese.
                    I did go there in 1977, before the opening of diplomatic relations. We still had
                    an Interest Section. I went there with the Secretary of Agriculture at the time,
                    Bob Bergland, and it was kind of a fascinating trip for me to see China. But it
                    was still fairly closed. We visited the capitol of Sichuan, Chengdu, and I think
                    were the first foreigners there. We were certainly the first Americans to visit
                    there, and perhaps even the first foreigners. We were as much the object of
                    curiosity by the local populace as they were for us. A racially different
                    people, and it was fascinating to be there. But in terms of doing business with
                    them, very little. I then was there again, about 15 months later, with Mike
                    Blumenthal, the Secretary of the Treasury, and it was just interesting how much
                    things had changed in 15 months. For one thing, the Friendship Store, which was
                    a store open to foreigners, the second time took American Express credit cards,
                    something they didn't do the first time. In fact, on that second occasion,
                    Blumenthal was the senior American official present when the Embassy was
                    officially established, because between the first and second visit, diplomatic
                    relations had been established.</p>
                <p>That was a matter of some embarrassment to me, because when I came back after the
                    first trip, '78, I was asked meet with the Export-Import Bank Board. The
                    President of the Bank had me over for lunch, with his Board present. They were
                    very interested in China, and my impressions. And they asked about diplomatic
                    relations, and I said I was rather skeptical that there would be any early
                    establishment of diplomatic relations; that there were a number of problems, and
                    it just seemed to me that the formality of diplomatic relations wasn't really
                    necessary to do business over there, either political or economically. I thought
                    it was off a ways. And then at about 5 o”clock, my Deputy came in to see me, and
                    he said, “You know, there”s something going on; an awful lot of telephoning
                    going on.” He'd heard something from the Hill, and shortly thereafter, Carter
                    announced the opening of diplomatic relations. I called the President of the
                    Bank and said, “There's no reason for you to believe anything I ever say
                    again.”</p>
                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>When I was at USTR, that was a part of the world that I had no formal
                    responsibility for. My colleague Linn Williams at first, and then later his
                    replacement, Mike Moskow, had responsibility for Asia. My responsibilities were
                    the Western Hemisphere and Europe, and multilateral negotiations, and that was
                    quite a lot. But there was one occasion when there was a Chinese delegation
                    visiting. For some reason I took the meeting. I don't know if that was during an
                    interregnum or my colleague was away. But there was a series of trade problems.
                    There had been and continue to be with China. I met with this delegation, and
                    one of the problems we were dealing with was the large imbalance in trade, but
                    particularly the Chinese restrictions and discrimination against American firms.
                    I recall I had information that they had specifically decided not to deal with
                    AT&amp;T in favor of a foreign telecommunications provider. My counterpart
                    across the table denied this. Then I had this information, which I think
                    incidentally came from intelligence sources. It was pretty solid information. I
                    think it was something somebody had said. Anyway, I confronted him with this,
                    and his delegation and they registered complete consternation. They went into a
                    huddle, and then he said in effect, “Where did you get that information?” But I
                    had no sustained contact with the Chinese. There was no one particular project
                    that I had with the Chinese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: About this information you got — I wonder if we could talk
                        about two things; One, the assistance that you got in your negotiations from
                        our embassies. In other words, they are picking up things on the street —
                        I'm talking about overt information. And then the other one, about perhaps
                        anything that came through, you might say, covert sources. But negotiations
                        are information. Where people are coming from is very important. Could you
                        talk about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Well, I'd have to say that the performance of embassies over the years was
                    mixed, and depended a lot on people. Some people were better than others. Some
                    embassies were better than others. Some were more plugged in. Sometimes it was
                    not altogether the fault of the people there, but in the circumstances. For
                    example, in the communist countries, there have been a lot of times when
                    embassies have had more difficulty in dealing with their counterparts, to the
                    governments to whom they were accredited, than did visitors. I've known many
                    American ambassadors who kind of resented the access that the officials of the
                    other government had to American officials in contrast to their own access. But
                    there were a number of cases where American diplomats abroad were there because
                    they were particularly able, or had good contacts, or were especially
                    aggressive, and therefore had insights into the thinking and the intentions of
                    the other government. They were quite important to us. But there was a mixed
                    performance. I can recall people who I thought were exceptionally able. I can
                    think of people at the other extreme. And most of them were in the middle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What would be the sort of thing that an embassy could
                        supply you that would be of value?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>KATZ: The first thing is that the embassies needed to do was to convey messages.
                    On instruction, they would go in and present the U.S. view, and not just present
                    a piece of paper, but go in there and be able to discuss it, to argue from a
                    brief. With the growth of communications and travel, that role declined in a lot
                    of cases, particularly as we got into more and more rather technical subjects.
                    But the other thing that embassies can provide is an understanding of what's
                    happening in the other country; the policy and the views of the other country;
                    who the players are; what their personalities are; how to deal with them, how to
                    be effective in negotiating with them. What we call biographic information. And
                    some of that, of course, comes through intelligence sources too. In fact,
                    intelligence really pulls a lot of that together, whether it comes from embassy
                    sources, or from their own sources. A lot of it is just overt. But it's become
                    increasingly rare that embassies will be players in the negotiation. That was
                    different in the old days. Ambassadors would be negotiators themselves. That has
                    changed, because you can get on an airplane and somebody can be in the capital
                    of the other country within 24 hours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it common practice before you would enter a set of
                        negotiations, that you would go out to embassies, and ask, “How do you think
                        this is going to play?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: I'd say that's pretty rare. It will depend on the subject, but in most
                    cases, particularly on economic subjects, the American officials know their
                    counterparts in the other countries. If they don't, they may visit the country
                    and the embassy will be involved in that sense. But a lot of the discussions are
                    bilateral, or a lot of them are multilateral discussions. Whether in the GATT,
                    the OECD, or in other regions, other regional fora, so that the U.S.
                    agricultural officials know their agricultural counterparts abroad. The Treasury
                    and Finance ministries, the trade people call them the mafia. They are highly
                    exclusionary. Treasury has attach�s in most important countries where there are
                    financial centers or are important trading partners with us. They operate within
                    a very closed circuit. Trade officials certainly know their counterparts. So the
                    role of embassies clearly has diminished in that respect. Even in things like
                    economic reporting. Years and decades ago, we used to depend on embassies to
                    understand what was happening in the economies of the countries. That doesn't
                    happen as much any more.</p>
                <p>In my experience in the Bush administration, 1989-1993, as compared pre-1980, I
                    don't remember reading very many reports from embassies. I spent a whole lot of
                    time trying to learn what was happening in one economy or another, because I
                    would read it either from the London Economist or some other publication, or
                    just the daily press. There's so much information out there. Embassies can't
                    produce it as fast, or necessarily even have insights that are not publicly
                    available.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the role of intelligence? Did this play much of
                        a role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>KATZ: That's become a story in the news very currently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about a wire-tap the CIA supposedly did for
                        automobile negotiations with the Japanese?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes. There have been stories about how the role of intelligence affected
                    the outcome of the auto negotiations with Japan. Let me say that in my view, the
                    role of intelligence in economic negotiations is marginal at best. Again, it
                    provides occasionally some insights into how people are thinking, but contrary
                    to beliefs and assertions in the case of the auto negotiations, intelligence can
                    almost never tell you what the bottom line is of the other country, what their
                    negotiating position is. You may know what their negotiating position is at a
                    given moment in time. Usually you know it after the fact, because intelligence
                    is rarely real time. But the reasons you don't know what the bottom line is, is
                    that the negotiators rarely know what their bottom line is. Negotiation is a
                    dynamic process, and positions evolve. Generally, you know what your objectives
                    are, and you know what you are seeking, but what you'll settle for in the end is
                    uncertain.</p>
                <p>You may go into the negotiation saying, “By God, unless I get this, it's no
                    deal.” One of the expressions that was frequently used in the Uruguay Round was
                    “No deal is better than a bad deal.” That was a mantra. But that is ridiculous.
                    Obviously, no one wants to agree to a bad deal. But the object of a negotiation
                    is to reach an agreement, and your views on what the balance is, is constantly
                    evolving. I have to say that these recent stories that have come out, and the
                    debate over the role of intelligence in economic and commercial relations
                    strikes me as an institution in search of a mission. It is a post-cold war
                    phenomenon. And I'm deeply suspicious about the source of these stories. It's
                    either CIA itself, or maybe it's the current USTR seeking to demonstrate how
                    smart he was in the auto negotiations, and what a great deal he got, which is
                    all a bit of hyperbole.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of negotiations, is there such a thing as a
                        negotiating victory?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Sure. You seek agreement to advance your interests, but it's really not a
                    zero-sum game. In a good negotiation, the best outcome is where both sides win,
                    and where both sides feel satisfied. A bad deal is not in anybody's interest. A
                    bad agreement would tend to be unstable. There are times clearly where one side
                    will put something over on the other. But in general, I would say that a good
                    agreement is one that has something for both sides. It doesn't have be
                    completely balanced. All people are not equal. Countries are not equal. That
                    doesn't mean that the big country always gets their way. Sometimes that small
                    country gets more than the big country.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself in negotiating concerned at times
                        that maybe you were putting something over on the people they didn't know,
                        and this could come up later as a problem because negotiation is not a here
                        and now thing and that's it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: There are agreements that I have been involved in which there were
                    subsequent problems, and I remember an expression of one of my lawyers, who,
                    commenting on the complaint of the other side, saying, “Well, we stole it fair
                    and square.” Because we did out negotiate them in terms of the language. Now,
                    sometimes you would get into problems like that, where you reach agreement on
                    the substance, and then it's translated into language. And sometimes the
                    language doesn't come out quite the right way, on one side or the other. Now, I
                    can think of at least one case where I lost out. I can think of one instance
                    where an agreement was negotiated it turned out that something was left out
                    inadvertently. And I went back to my counterpart and said, “Look, we made a
                    mistake. This was left out.” And he was enough of a gentleman say, “O.K., we
                    didn't intend that.” And so we amended the agreement. And there are cases where
                    we've done that. Obviously you want to get the most you can for your side, but
                    you don't want to do it at the expense of jeopardizing the success of the
                    agreement over the long term. Modern agreements are so complex — economic
                    agreements or trade agreements — and have so many elements in them, it's hard to
                    say that one side got the better of another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see a changing role — you had a long time doing
                        this — in the role of the Department of Commerce as far as trade agreements
                        went?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Yes. The Commerce Department role did change. There was a time,
                    particularly prior to 1963, when the Commerce Department had primary
                    responsibility. That is, they had the coordinating role within the government.
                    They chaired the trade agreements committee within the government. The State
                    Department had it before that, and then it went to Commerce. And then in the
                    1963 act, it was decided to create the office of the Special Trade
                    Representative, which later became the U.S. Trade Representative. And that was
                    to really provide a more neutral place to bring together the government
                    policy.</p>
                <p>What the Commerce Department had was more technical support, or if you like
                    expert advice. Although some of that was also in the International Trade
                    Commission, the old Tariff Commission. Of course, the Commerce Department always
                    played an important role with respect to policy, representing industry in a
                    sense. In terms of the advocacy positions in the government, you had Commerce
                    representing industry, and Agriculture representing agriculture, and the Labor
                    its constituency and State Department representing a broad foreign policy
                    interest, and the Treasury representing economic policy interests, and so
                    forth.</p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>So Commerce has always played a role in that sense, but they have not played the
                    central role, at least since the 1950s. Now this has, of course, given rise to a
                    lot of bureaucratic pushing and shoving, and elbowing from time to time. There
                    have been repeated attempts by some Secretaries of Commerce to try to play a
                    more leading role. This came to a kind of a crux in the Reagan Administration,
                    when Secretary of Commerce Baldridge tried to create, and indeed got President
                    Reagan to agree to create a Department of Trade and Industry, which was really
                    based on the Japanese Ministry of Industry and Trade, MITI. This was called the
                    DITI. In fact, I was in New York at the time on a program with Mac Baldridge,
                    and I took the other side of the argument.</p>
                <p>It's very hard for people to understand why we need to have 16 different agencies
                    all involved in foreign trade. But that's a reflection of our economy. The
                    reason there is complexity in foreign trade is because foreign trade is by its
                    nature a complex subject. Foreign trade consists of goods crossing the border.
                    Before they cross the border they are produced by some sector of the economy. So
                    it does involve industry, it does involve agriculture. It does involve Treasury
                    and the State Department has an interest. And the Defense Department has an
                    interest. But then there are a host of other agencies, like the Food and Drug
                    Administration, the Department of Justice may have an interest in terms of
                    anti-trust policy, and so on. So there must be some way of bringing it
                    together.</p>
                <p>Now you can put the primary responsibility in one place or another. You can put
                    it in State, or Commerce, or Treasury, or put it in a separate agency. But
                    ultimately, what is required is to bring all of the elements together in some
                    kind of a coherent policy and strategy.</p>
                <p>In 1963, it was decided that the best place to put all that is in the White House
                    itself, and have a small staff. Now, unfortunately, that staff has grown, but
                    still very small by normal standards, roughly somewhere around 150, although
                    during my time we had detailees from other agencies, so that we had about 200
                    people. But then we were running two huge negotiations at the same time. But
                    that's a model that has worked very well. Now the proposals to abolish the
                    Commerce Department have very little to do with the question how you run trade
                    policy.</p>
                <p>The proposals to abolish the Commerce Department are a form of trophy hunting, or
                    to put it another way, I've kind of likened it to the current television game
                    called Jeopardy, where the object is to state the answer, now what's the
                    question? Part of it is most largely driven by the desire of the new young
                    Republicans in the House to abolish something in the government, and Commerce is
                    a very obvious target because it not only deals with foreign trade, it deals
                    with dozens of other subjects. It's been described as the nation's attic or
                    garage. And it has such things as oceanographic matters, the Weather Bureau, the
                    Census Bureau, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the NIST, and
                    God knows what else.</p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>The current proposal coming out of the House is to take the International Trade
                    Administration, which are about 2,000 people in the Commerce Department, and put
                    it in USTR. Well, what I've said, that's not abolishing the Commerce Department,
                    that's abolishing USTR. It's really eliminating the role of USTR. It's taking it
                    out of the White House, because it's too big for the White House. It's not a
                    department, but it has Cabinet status, and it's just a very messy idea. I don't
                    know whether it will survive, but the President has said that he will oppose it,
                    veto it, so I suppose it won't happen this year, maybe not next year either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Congress? Did you find that Congress, every
                        time we have an agreement, you always have to give something? Did you find
                        Congressmen of one persuasion would latch on to something about our giving
                        away the store, or that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Congress is really an essential player in the conduct of foreign trade,
                    because foreign trade is a power which is reserved to the Congress. In fact, I
                    have described the conduct of trade policy as kind of condominium. The Congress,
                    under the Constitution, has the power to levy taxes, and to regulate foreign
                    trade, but the President has the authority and the responsibility to carry out
                    foreign relations. And you can't do one without the other. Since 1934, with the
                    Reciprocal Trade Act, post-Smoot-Hawley Tariff, the Congress has typically
                    authorized the President to enter into agreements to reduce tariffs and to
                    proclaim the results thereof. That is, to carry out tariff reductions by
                    proclamation, within stated limits in the legislation. That is, the President
                    can cut 20 percent or up to 50 percent in certain acts.</p>
                <p>But, as I've said, trade agreements have become much more complex, and they deal
                    with a lot more than just tariffs. They deal with tariffs, non-tariff measures,
                    all kinds of regulations, laws affecting commerce, intellectual property,
                    investment policy, and so the Congress, since 1974, has not been willing to
                    authorize — well, Congress has never been willing to authorize the President to
                    change the laws of the country, other than tariffs. And so since 1974, we've had
                    the fast-track negotiating authority.</p>
                <p>That has become essential for the United States to carry out trade negotiations
                    because other countries will clearly not negotiate with the United States, and
                    sign an agreement, and then have to have the agreement come back to the
                    Congress, and have the Congress rewrite it on the floor. But what happens in
                    fact, is through the consultation process in the course of negotiations, and
                    then in the development of that implementing bill, there is a process known as
                    mock mark up sessions, where the relevant committees review the agreement and
                    the proposed legislation, and they try to push the envelope in terms of what is
                    in the agreement. And sometimes there are some side deals that are cut. But
                    basically, this is a process that has worked pretty well for about 20 years.</p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>Unfortunately, that authority has expired. It expired a year ago, and has not
                    been renewed. It is currently a matter of contention between the White House and
                    the Congress. They have fallen into a disagreement over the desire of the
                    Administration to add labor and environmental standards to trade agreements. And
                    the majority of the Congress is opposed to that.</p>
                <p>As I have said when I described the NAFTA process that throughout the NAFTA
                    process and the Uruguay Round, all the time we were conducting these
                    negotiations, we were engaged in very close consultation both with the Congress,
                    and with the private sector. So that we knew how much latitude we had in the
                    negotiation. We knew basically what would be acceptable. That's just become an
                    essential part of conducting a trade negotiation for U.S. negotiators.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that these consultations in the middle of
                        negotiations, that you would have problems, to use an expression, either
                        somebody from the private sector or from Congress, going off the
                        reservation, saying, “We're trying to do this, and they are absolutely
                        wrong,” and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>KATZ: Absolutely. It's a horrendous process. You're balancing all kinds of
                    considerations at the same time. It's a lot more complicated than playing chess.
                    And sometimes there are private sector interests that are in opposition to one
                    another. During the NAFTA negotiations, for example, we had a horrendous problem
                    over something called “flat panel displays.” These are monitors, television
                    monitors. There's a small, nascent industry trying build these flat panel
                    displays, mostly a small size that they were providing to the military to use in
                    airplanes and tanks. And basically it was subsidized through the Defense
                    Department. But the commercial flat panels were not being produced in the United
                    States. They were being produced primarily in Japan. IBM and other companies
                    were engaged in large joint ventures in Japan to produce these. So here I was
                    caught between the domestic flat panel industry, whom I called the “flat-earth
                    people,” and their congressional supporters on one side, and the IBMs and the
                    Compaqs, and the Hewlett Packards of the United States, on the other side. I got
                    to a point where I absolutely despaired of coming to an agreement. This had
                    nothing to do with the foreigners. This was just the god-damned Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking back on the whole thing, Julius, how do you see
                        America's position as far as trade? Has it developed well, or not so well?
                        Do you see other countries moving ahead?</hi>

                <p>KATZ: This really is a marvelous country. It's an incredible country, with
                    strengths that are greater than exist in most countries in the world. Yes, we
                    have our problems, obviously. But it has more resiliency than most countries in
                    the world. The other point I'd make, is that we do go through cycles, and other
                    countries do as well. In the period in the 1970s, and 80's mostly as a result of
                    bad policies, but also partly for cyclical reasons, we had some severe economic
                    problems. But our economy has been transformed since then. That is still going
                    on now, and so we have become the most competitive country in the world
                    economically, in virtually all sectors. We still produce an awful lot of
                    automobiles in this country. One can argue whether the quality of Japanese
                    automobiles are higher than American automobiles, but if you look at it in terms
                    of quality versus price, we still have a strong industry. And then when you go
                    beyond that, to technologically advanced industries, of course, we're way ahead
                    of everybody else. We produce something like 80 percent of the software in the
                    world.</p>
                <p>Now, it isn't necessarily forever. Bad policy can defeat that. One of the
                    consequences of this transformation of the economy that we have seen, is that
                    there are serious problems and questions about income levels, particularly at
                    the lower and middle levels. Incomes have not risen, and that's a cause for
                    concern. There has been a lot of displacement of labor, in large part, because
                    of the globalization of the economy and the transformation of the economy, with
                    companies getting leaner, productivity is going up, and that's at the expense of
                    labor. That's not limited to the U.S. That's true in Europe as well. But that
                    again, is a cyclical phenomenon, and I don't know at this point how and when
                    that will change, but I'm sure it will.</p>
                <p>A decade ago or less everybody thought that the Japanese had suddenly become 10
                    feet tall and that the Japanese were going dominate the world. The Japanese now
                    are in very serious trouble. Again, people tend to exaggerate problems, and some
                    think the Japanese banking system could collapse. I don't believe that will
                    happen, but the Japanese are going through some very severe problems. China has
                    now become a matter of great concern. China could become the dominant economy in
                    the world, but people don't understand the history of China, and what some of
                    their own tendencies are. But all through this what I have been impressed with,
                    as I said, is the resiliency of our own economy, our people.</p>
                <p>One of the things that I've enjoyed over the years is seeing young people come
                    along. Through the Vietnam War, when everybody thought that our children were
                    going astray, there were people that we'd recruited into the State Department,
                    and they were bright and enthusiastic, challenging and I see that constantly. So
                    I don't know how we're going to get past the next year, but I have great
                    optimism about the future.</p>
