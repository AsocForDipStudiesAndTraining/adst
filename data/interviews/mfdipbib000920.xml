                <p>Interviewed by: Arthur R. Day </p>
                <p>Initial interview date: February 24, 1989</p>
                <p>Copyright 1998 ADST</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Larry, you spent most of your career in Latin America, and
                        it seems logical to me that we focus on that for this interview. I'll have
                        some questions, but obviously whatever you think happened to you in your
                        experiences that are important to put on the record, do so. You don't have
                        to follow my lead. I'll simply introduce any thoughts that have come to me;
                        but you were there and doing it, so that's the important thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>As a backdrop for talking about Latin America, I wondered if you had any general
                    comments about the kind of relationship the U.S. has with Central and South
                    America, that sets the stage and creates the pressures for people like yourself
                    working in that area. Certainly, it's a unique relationship.</p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Well, indeed it is, and I think it grows out of a series of historic
                    realities, the first being that we're both, sort of, transplants—or the ruling
                    elites in both hemispheres—are transplants from Europe. Most of the people in
                    the United States came from Northern or Southern Europe, and naturally most of
                    the people in Latin America came from the Iberian Peninsula.</p>
                <p>The timing was not too different, either. The Spanish arrived a little earlier
                    than—or developed the area a little earlier than the Northerners—the Northern
                    Europeans.</p>
                <p>The type of colonization was different; it was more exploitative in the south,
                    and more communal and developmental in the north—the United States.</p>
                <p>But there were historical contacts then. You find such things as their liberator
                    becoming a great admirer of Washington—Bolivar—looking upon Washington as a
                    liberator, because he—as Washington—saw the mother countries were not serving
                    the new colonies that had a life of their own.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>And over the years, even if you look at American diplomatic history, some of our
                    earliest pronouncements were about this hemisphere: the Monroe Doctrine, the
                    shipping-commercial ties were more intimate with the Caribbean and Central
                    American, less so with South America. As time went on, the social ties became
                    stronger; the immigration was mostly south to north. The educational ties went
                    both ways; people coming up from South and Central America to the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>So you have a series of things: the historical similarities; the colonial periods
                    we both went though; the breaking away from colonial periods; the growth into
                    individual countries; and all these social, economic, and political ties. Those
                    are similar, and I think the Latins feel them as much as we do. And you feel
                    them once you start working in Latin America. There's a tendency to feel
                    comfortable with Latins, even when they might have animosities or reasons to
                    feel critical of the United States.</p>
                <p>The differences are pronounced, too. We became a success story. And like any
                    success story, there's a certain amount of admiration for it, and jealousy. So
                    you get this love-hate relationship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But as a diplomat working in Latin America, did you feel
                        that the American body politic, generally, was much more involved with your
                        area than might have been the case, let's say, with Europe or Asia in
                        general?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: The amount of American investment, business connection, and so on is
                    intense. I don't know if it's any more intense than you find in some European
                    countries, but it's of a different nature, and it does affect the attitudes of
                    people on both sides of this line we're drawing here, in the way they relate to
                    one another. It's a unique—I think it's been called that—a unique relationship,
                    and indeed, it is, and it's different, depending upon the countries you're
                    in.</p>
                <p>You'll find in the southern cone in South America, especially on the eastern
                    side—countries like Argentina, Uruguay—they have never developed that closeness
                    with the United States, basically because they've always felt closer to Europe.
                    And if you go to Argentina, you'd find that the Argentine middle-class family,
                    if they have the resources to send their child to a university outside the
                    country, will send them to Italy, or France, or England. That would never happen
                    in most of your other Latin American countries. If they have the resources, they
                    send them up to a U.S. university. So that's sort of a unique little area whose
                    roots and intellectual ties are more in Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were ambassador in Uruguay. That was your first
                        experience at that level of policy making in this country toward a Latin
                        America country, although you must have seen it from other levels and other
                        perspectives earlier. I wonder how that impressed you. You had, for example,
                        this problem of the withholding of American military aid, because of the way
                        the Uruguayans were treating human rights in their efforts to get at the
                        leftists in the country. Did this cause you serious problems in your job—the
                        fact that there was this split back in Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Well, it was the issue, and it had grown out of the decision by the
                    Congress just two years before I went there. Congress really took the initiative
                    in cutting off military assistance to Uruguay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was it that you went down?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: I went down in 1977, and Congress cut aid to Uruguay in 1976, one year
                    before. There was an amendment by a future mayor of a northeastern city, called
                    Koch, who took the initiative on this issue, and curtailed military assistance
                    to Uruguay.</p>
                <p>When I got there, there were a series of issues to be faced. First of all, the
                    Uruguayan military felt very aggrieved; they felt that the United States had
                    misunderstood them, had dealt arbitrarily with them. They were quite bitter and
                    made no bones of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They told you this, I suppose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Absolutely. My first meeting was with the three Service Commanders; they
                    had a triumvirate running the government, and we spent three and a half hours,
                    they professing that the United States didn't understand Communism, and didn't
                    understand the problems they had, and had abandoned them in their hour of need;
                    and my saying to them, “You're exaggerating. If you went back and looked at what
                    we did over the years with you, you'd know that's not true. I'm surprised you're
                    saying that. And furthermore, what you're doing now puts our whole relationship
                    in jeopardy, because you've taken arbitrary action against your citizens, and
                    I'm not even questioning whether they deserve it or not. But world opinion is
                    against you and our relationship is hostage to actions you've taken.” So that's
                    how we began. The day I arrived.</p>
                <p>And human rights became the central issue. It was interesting. When I got there,
                    there was a lot of mythology as to what had happened in Uruguay, in the State
                    Department's own recollection of events. I set about to try to get the facts. I
                    had my political officers, and my station, and the military officers, spend full
                    time. I said, “I want to know the history. Let's look back at what happened, and
                    turn it over stone by stone.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The history of how the government had handled the
                        guerrilla movement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Yes, that's right. And what emerged was interesting, if you have the
                    time for it. Because what had happened was this. Uruguay was a traditional, and
                    one of the most longstanding democracies in Latin America, in fact one of the
                    models. Uruguay, Chile, Columbia—those were the models of Latin American
                    democracy. Along about the middle of 1950-60, they suffered a real decline,
                    economically. Uruguay had always been an exporter of meats, hides, products of
                    that nature. World War II was one of the big heydays. Then there was a slump.
                    The Korean War was another big heyday. And then it slumped again. And
                    unfortunately they had not diversified their economy enough, so this slump
                    really hit, and it kept going down.</p>
                <p>And what happened—it's a very small country, very middle-class—the young
                    people—professionals—accountants, lawyers, doctors—professionals of all
                    sorts—became frustrated in the late sixties. And they began to look around and
                    attack their system. The Tupamaros was the product of their frustrations: first
                    reflecting their criticism then turning violent into a guerrilla band. It began
                    as an attack on the system for not providing the jobs and the opportunities. And
                    then it turned nasty.</p>
                <p>And the system was very soft. It's a small country. The crime rate was low. And
                    suddenly, this emerges. And the democratic government, which was soft and quite
                    fragile couldn't handle it. So the military were called in.</p>
                <p>The Uruguayan military had never fought a war; indeed, had never been called upon
                    to do anything but parade and drill. And they came in and rolled up the
                    Tupamaros, who were not very good as guerrillas. Once they trusted power, they
                    decided that this was not a bad place to be, and took over the government.</p>
                <p>And the interesting thing was that the repression did not occur then. I mean, the
                    Tupamaros were guilty of crimes, there's no question. They blew up banks, they
                    killed people, they committed terrorist acts—all of which were documentable—and
                    criminal offenses. It was after the Tupamaros were rolled up, and the military
                    assumed power that they began to investigate the root causes of the subversion.
                    It was they that overreacted and committed all the abuses. They went into the
                    universities, and became suspicious of university courses. They went after
                    leftist professors. And before you know it, they were torturing people for
                    information, making arbitrary arrests, and ultimately filling the prisons with
                    some 5,000 political prisoners.</p>
                <p>But when we found this out, and it took us about six months . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your embassy working . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>PEZZULO: Yes. And we did it, you know, in a very studious way; in the meantime,
                    just sort of keeping the ball afloat. Then I started to confront them with the
                    reality of their own actions. And lo and behold, most of them didn't even know
                    the history.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Them being the Uruguayans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: The Uruguayan military. And then I had the argument, you know, “Why are
                    you paying so high a price for actions that can be reversed?” I don't understand
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You won the war, why . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Well, that was sort of the centerpiece, and it became an intriguing
                    problem. And they slowly began to see that this ambassador and this embassy were
                    really interested in dealing with the problem. And they began to look at their
                    own internal problems. And slowly prisoners who were in prison for years were
                    released. And it slowly started to improve. I think it was an awareness that
                    they in and of themselves couldn't come to because they had built up this
                    illusion that they were the great saviors of the society.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A mythology of their own.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Their own mythology. And Washington had another mythology. I mean, they
                    were not pug-uglies, they were people who had gone through an experience which
                    they were not prepared for, then tried to become cleansers of a society that
                    didn't really need so thorough a cleansing; and got overzealous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a hard time selling this new look back in
                        Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Well, the problem back in Washington became how to react to the positive
                    steps the Uruguayan military was taking? And there were such things as
                    helicopter parts that they needed badly. And at the time, there were some
                    zealots on human rights that came in with the Carter administration—in the human
                    rights office—that, you know, wanted blood. They were not willing to respond
                    incrementally.</p>
                <p>My approach to the Uruguayans was to prod them by saying: “You show me prisoner
                    releases, you show me that you're closing up the offices that do the
                    torturing”—there were two of them. “You close them down”—one of them they
                    closed, by the way, by cutting off its gasoline allotment—just cut it off. “You
                    do that, don't tell me about it, we'll find out, and we'll react.”</p>

                <p>Once they began reacting positively, I needed some give from our side. When I
                    approached Washington, the reaction from the ideologues was, “Now wait a minute.
                    It's not finished, and you can't show me that you did thus and so.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From the human rights people, particularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The military, on the other hand, in Washington were all
                        for you, I suppose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Our military weren't involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see, they weren't?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: They were willing to do whatever had to be done. I mean, Uruguay was not
                    an important country that they were going to fight for. And the whole program
                    was a peanut; it didn't amount to very much. It's a small country; it's a
                    country of two and a half, three million people.</p>
                <p>But what was pleasing is that we were able to find out what the problem was. It
                    was like trying to deal with a disease—giving medication—and you don't know what
                    the heck you're dealing with. Pretty soon the medication was worse than the
                    disease. But once it was cleared away, it was very pleasing to see that they
                    suddenly realized that we were not trying to stick their nose in the mud; we
                    were honestly trying to help and return the relationship to a more normal
                    level.</p>
                <p>And I wouldn't go so far as to say we were responsible for their return to
                    democracy, but there are democrats down there who will say that. Out of this
                    came a softening by the military, because they realized they had overplayed
                    their hand; some of the more rational within the military started to see, and
                    could argue their case a little better—this we were told when I was there—that
                    they felt now they could speak, because the facts were coming out, and there had
                    been unnecessarily harsh repression.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find in your own relationships with the military
                        leaders there that you could establish a relationship of some trust,
                        personally?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: I had—you know, some of them were very brittle. One of the commanders
                    was a tough cookie, and he didn't like, at all, this gringo ambassador telling
                    them about their business.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>But some of the others were a lot more appreciative. Well, what really happened,
                    I think, is that once they saw that this was a sincere effort to try to cope
                    with the problem—I mean, I was not going to cocktail parties and forgetting
                    this. We were getting into it. They realized there was a desire on the U.S.
                    government part to do something constructive. And as they saw this was not an
                    attempt to either embarrass them, or to make the case worse—in fact, it was an
                    attempt to really find out what the heck happened—they became appreciative. So I
                    had friends. You know, I had people who used to call me up and say, “Look, you
                    met with so and so the other day, and you were a little tough on him. You know,
                    he's this kind of guy, and it's best to handle him a little more gingerly.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were Uruguay military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Uruguay military.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they saw you as, in a sense, pushing their cause, and
                        they wanted you to do it right.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: That's right. And the politicians were unable to play any role. For
                    example, the current President was proscribed from acting in an political way.
                    In other words, he could not have a meeting in his house for any political
                    purpose; it was against the law. And the two traditional parties, that went back
                    to the beginning of the history of the country—the 1830s—were proscribed because
                    of this foolishness about a bunch of kids who got out of sorts. I mean, it was
                    almost a fairy tale, that had, you know, just gotten way out of control.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So by the time you left, things had really improved a
                        lot.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: They had gone from about 4,700 prisoners, down to less than 1,000. And
                    they were letting them out quietly. And they were starting to talk about
                    political liberalization. Now there was full censorship when I was there. All
                    politicians were proscribed. Now this in a country that, prior to this period,
                    had a free press and a prestigious university system. The military closed down
                    the fine arts departments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It hits those countries worse. Chile was the other
                        example.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Same type of thing, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you leave there in order to be sent to Nicaragua?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>PEZZULO: No, what happened was that Nicaragua was starting to get ugly, and I got
                    a call one day, and they said, “We'd like you to go to Nicaragua.” Harry Barnes
                    called me one morning, and said, “Can you give me your answer?”</p>
                <p>And I said, you know, “Let me at least talk to my wife.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was the Director General?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: He was the Director General. And I agreed. I left shortly thereafter.
                    And went up to Washington, and off to Nicaragua.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let me ask you about that period in Washington, because
                        you must have been immersed in the development of what became our policy
                        toward Somoza, and his retirement, and what that all led to. What was the
                        scene in Washington when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Well, the two main actors in the State Department were Pete Vaky, who
                    was the Assistant Secretary for Inter-American Affairs; and Bill Bowdler, who
                    was the head of INR. Both former ambassadors, both very experienced, very
                    competent officers. The reason they were the two principals was that about seven
                    months before there was a negotiated—what they called a mediation effort—that
                    was organized by the OAS (the Organization of American States). And Bowdler, who
                    was in INR at the time, was assigned by the Secretary to represent the United
                    States.</p>
                <p>Now that effort was an attempt to get Somoza to step down. It didn't begin that
                    way. What had happened was that in early 1978—you probably have heard this—one
                    of Nicaragua's major editors . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was Chamorro?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Pedro Joaquin Chamorro was shot down in the streets. Even though I don't
                    think Somoza did it, the country went up in flames. And what had been a slow
                    deterioration in his position over a long time, suddenly became untenable.
                    Somoza over-reacted, brusquely using the National Guard to attack towns,
                    firebombing and the like. It got so bad that by the middle of 1978, the OAS met
                    to decide whether it could play a useful role.</p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>After a particularly brutal attack by the National Guard in a town called Esteli,
                    the OAS called a special session. They passed a resolution which led to the
                    naming of a three-member commission: the United States, Guatemala, and the
                    Dominican Republic. And they were to go to Nicaragua to see if they could help
                    in some way to bring about an end to the hostilities.</p>
                <p>Well, they got in there—Bowdler headed our delegation—and they found that the
                    Nicaraguans were completely polarized: Somoza with a few cronies, and the
                    National Guard, on one side; and everything right, left, and center in
                    opposition. And that recognition came to them very quickly, because the three
                    delegations had spread out and had spoken to all sectors: newspaper editors,
                    politicians, church leaders, campesinos, everyone. And it was, you know, just a
                    repetition of the same message: “We've had enough, we've had enough.”</p>
                <p>Well, that led to a period in which the OAS mediators were dealing with Somoza on
                    the one hand, and on the other with this multi-partied opposition, to try to see
                    if there was some way to resolve the conflict. The opposition organized itself,
                    ultimately, into a national front—a coordinated front—and demanded that Somoza
                    leave, and that they would form a transitional government that would lead to
                    general elections.</p>
                <p>Well, negotiations went on and on for about three and a half months, ultimately
                    were thwarted by Somoza, and collapsed. And when they collapsed, Pete Vaky and
                    Bowdler, who had put a tremendous amount of effort into it, were exhausted. They
                    had been fighting back and forth with the NSC and at the White House, because
                    they thought more pressure should be put on Somoza by the United States. They
                    thought if he'd leave the Presidency, there was a chance for a peaceful
                    transition to some, yet undetermined, kind of democratic government.</p>
                <p>Well, anyway, it failed. Pete, I think, was exhausted. Bowdler was exhausted. And
                    we (the U.S.) sort of retracted from the scene, a bit. In historic terms it's
                    very interesting, because the Sandinistas—who were divided into three divisions,
                    three factions—once the mediation effort failed, came together into one faction,
                    with the aid and assistance of Fidel Castro. In fact, they went to Cuba to sign
                    a unity pact and formed the FSLN.</p>
                <p>And then they began planning the armed overthrow of Somoza, with the assistance
                    of Cuba, Venezuela, Costa Rica, and Panama. And I think it's fair to say we in
                    the United States, and the State Department, and the intelligence services, were
                    just not watching too carefully. I mean, everybody knew something was amiss, but
                    you know, the antennae were not all that attuned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we didn't realize that the Cubans had succeeded in
                        pushing them into a . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: That was known, but that they were now building up for a major military
                    campaign against Somoza, I don't think was known. In fact, when I was called
                    back, and I went to a meeting in Costa Rica in which they were discussing
                    Central American policy . . .</p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: The meeting was held in early May of 1979.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were still in Uruguay?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Still in Uruguay. I went up to this meeting. It was a three-day meeting
                    to look at Central America, because Central America was clearly in crisis. We
                    reviewed the same kinds of problems we face now, only then they were a little
                    more subdued. And the report on Nicaragua basically focused on how we would
                    convince Somoza to step down at the end of his term in 1981. And not a whisper
                    about impending civil war. In fact, the reports from all sectors indicated some
                    buildup as well as fatigue. But nobody was talking about imminent attack.</p>
                <p>Well, by the end of the month an imminent attack was real. And I get into
                    Washington the first week in June, and the war was on; we had a civil war. I
                    mean, they were starting to topple cities. And that same fatigue in Washington
                    was evident. There's no question about it. You just sensed the fact that
                    everybody was down.</p>
                <p>Now another thing had occurred, which made it even more disappointing for us. And
                    that is that our ambassador to Nicaragua, a political appointee—who I think,
                    unfortunately, was ill-chosen for the job—had picked up and left Nicaragua in
                    the spring. That's why they called me; because he just picked up and left,
                    without authority, or so much as by your leave. So they had no ambassador, and a
                    very inexperienced staff. There was no reporting or analysis coming out of
                    Managua. They were in a bind. Here's a civil war going on; no ambassador, and an
                    embassy which isn't operating.</p>
                <p>And within the next three weeks we were meeting almost daily, either at the NSC,
                    or in one meeting or another. And what we put together was basically a policy
                    that said the only thing the United States can do now, given the circumstances,
                    is go in and hasten the departure of Somoza—end the war. And if we can end the
                    war, then there is a certain amount of political capital we'll get for having
                    stopped the bloodshed. And perhaps we can use that political capital to have
                    some effect on the new government.</p>
                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>And the basic outlines of it—without getting complicated—were that we, as I say,
                    we thought if we could end the conflict—and we probably were the only nation who
                    could do that—we could get some political momentum to bring about a transition
                    that was somewhat democratic, or participatory. I don't think anybody had high
                    hopes, because in the middle of a civil war it's hard to figure out what's going
                    to come after. And most of the discussions almost sounded like something about
                    cleaning apartments, because everybody was talking about vacuums. I'll never
                    forget this period. You know, what do we do about the vacuums, and this vacuum,
                    and that vacuum.</p>
                <p>And indeed, it becomes a fascination with people who are analyzing things to
                    death, while events are changing quickly on the ground. And this followed me
                    into Nicaragua. I mean, I was dealing with the war, and I kept getting the
                    commentary from Washington, you know, by people who are sitting there dreaming
                    up new schemes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they have the thought, perhaps, that if they got
                        Somoza out early enough the Sandinistas wouldn't actually win the war, and
                        that therefore there would be a possibility of a non-Sandinista
                        government?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Yes. Well, one of the crackpot ideas—it's crackpot in hindsight—was that
                    we could suddenly construct a new transitional government of “wise men.” It
                    borrowed from a concept considered eight months earlier during the mediation
                    effort. Simply put, we would approach people who had already been identified as
                    leaders in the community, and say, “Suppose we end the war, could you walk in
                    and become president of Nicaragua?”</p>
                <p>And one of my first jobs was to go in, in the middle of a civil war and find
                    these people, who were all hiding—some of them had left the country—and propose
                    to them that they form this group of wise men. Well, the problem is they didn't
                    trust the U.S. government anymore. They had exposed themselves eight months
                    before, when suddenly—when the moment of truth came, to get Somoza out, we
                    couldn't deliver. I mean, that's how they saw it—to put it in the bluntest
                    terms. And they weren't about to expose themselves again in the middle of a
                    civil war.</p>
                <p>But in Washington's mind, especially the NSC, it was doable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this Brzezinski himself?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>PEZZULO: It was Brzezinski and some of the people around him. I think people were
                    groping for straws. They were hoping you could come up with some sort of a
                    miracle, in the middle of a very distasteful situation. And what I was concerned
                    with, as this thing started to deteriorate—because what was happening is that
                    the war was coming in closer and closer into Managua—is that if we failed to
                    remove Somoza, after all this chipping away, we'd end up with nothing. I mean,
                    the only thing we had to deliver, and I kept saying this in various forums, was
                    Somoza. And if we failed to get him out, and stop the bloodshed, then we had
                    nothing.</p>
                <p>The other idea, which I thought was more, at least, possible, was to preserve
                    some elements of the National Guard; so that you would have a transition with
                    some members of a security force that were disciplined, and capable of retaining
                    some balance. Now again, in hindsight, that was illusory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived in Nicaragua, did you find that as
                        possible?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: I thought it was possible. What made it impossible was Somoza, and that
                    was hard to calculate. One thing I really miscalculated was how frightened he
                    was. I think what happened at the end proves that he thought that the National
                    Guard would kill him. Unfortunately, I couldn't get to the Guard directly,
                    naturally; there was no way for me to do that, and my military attach� couldn't
                    get to the guard, either, because they were fighting a war.</p>
                <p>I was discussing the future of the Guard only with Somoza and his son. The
                    planning was being done in a vacuum, to the extent that the officers in the
                    Guard were not involved. I worked out a scenario with Somoza in which he would
                    step down under his own constitutional processes; so there was no interruption
                    in that—and turnover power to a member of the congress, who would then invite in
                    the junta in San Jos�. They would begin deliberating on the transfer of power.
                    The new head of the National Guard, who was going to be named, would do the same
                    thing with the Sandinista forces. And there would be a cease-fire and
                    stand-down, and the initiation of discussions about merging forces.</p>
                <p>While we were talking about this with Somoza, Bowdler, who was in San Jos�, was
                    talking to the junta. So everything we did—everything I negotiated—the junta was
                    party to, even to the naming of the new National Guard commander.</p>
                <p>The problem, we know in hindsight, was Somoza never relayed this, honestly, to
                    his own Guard. Because he was afraid that if he did—if they ever thought he was
                    leaving Nicaragua, and not getting what he ultimately promised them (that the
                    United States was going to come in—once he got out—to support them)—they would
                    kill him. And that's what frustrated this entire play. What happened was that
                    Somoza left. We didn't come in to the support of the Guard, because we'd never
                    promised that. But the Guard, deceived by Somoza, didn't know that. They
                    suddenly found themselves without Somoza, and without U.S. assistance, and they
                    broke down.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They collapsed very quickly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: They collapsed within—within twenty-four hours they were gone; they had
                    all run up to Honduras, or to other places.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You met with Somoza quite a few times. Had you met him
                        before that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: I'd met him years before, during the earthquake of 1972.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were these meetings during the civil war like? Were
                        they one on one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: The first one was; I figured I owed it to him, just from a courtesy
                    point of view, to make it one on one. So I went in alone. And that's when he had
                    Congressman Murphy with him, and his foreign minister.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Murphy was a congressman from New York, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Staten Island. In fact, Somoza remarked surprisingly: “You're
                    alone?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, I thought that would be a courtesy to extend to you, if you wanted
                    to speak to me alone.” After that I was accompanied by a team. Usually I brought
                    somebody with me from Washington, and then later I had a DCM who was with me—a
                    new DCM. So it was usually myself, a DCM—and another advisor; there'd be three
                    on our side, and he'd have anywhere from three to six; it varied.</p>
                <p>And they were very business-like meetings. I mean, he would—we knew he was
                    taping, by the way. But he would go through these rhetorical diversions every
                    once in a while, I guess it was time for him to make his little speech—and he'd
                    go through a long speech about, you know, how much he liked the United States,
                    and you know, he said, “I'm a Latin from Manhattan.” He spoke beautiful English
                    and knew the United States better than I did. He'd been every place. And I think
                    he honestly liked the United States of America—there's no question in my mind.
                    He was a very charming rascal.</p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>So he'd regale with stories of how he'd helped the United States here, there, and
                    the other place. And he'd done our business for us. And how could we be doing
                    this to him? And you know, the Communists were going to come in, and so on. And
                    he went on, and on, and on. And he would belabor people in the Carter
                    administration, who he really had a burn against—and Carter himself. So you had
                    to listen to all of this, because this was all for the tape.</p>
                <p>But then he'd get down to the business at hand, and talk about various things. My
                    concerns were the timing of his departure; this National Guard issue—setting it
                    up, getting the right commander. And part of the time, waiting for Washington to
                    agree that we had to start the countdown. I was trying to push the countdown—you
                    know, the 72-hour countdown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you saw things coming apart?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Yes, and naturally being in the middle of it, and hearing it . . . I
                    mean, you know, Managua at night was like being in a battlefield—firing, and so
                    on. And then you just had the sense of this thing closing in on you. And we were
                    getting constant reports on how much ammunition the guard had left. Somoza was
                    making excursions—or trips out—for resupplies.</p>
                <p>See, we had cut off supply to the Guard. We had stopped some supplies that were
                    coming from Israel; on the high seas we stopped them—diverted the ships. We were
                    telling his former suppliers in Central America—Guatemala and others—to cut it
                    off. They did. So his materiel was slowly running down. We knew that. We also
                    knew the opposition forces were building up. So you could just sense a closing
                    in. There was no way of knowing when it would break, so you tended to want to
                    get the darn scenario in place.</p>
                <p>Plus, as I say, there was—I think there was a lot of lyricism on the part of
                    Washington, as to what you could do under the circumstances. And maybe it's
                    natural, when you're sitting up at Washington, you figure you have more options
                    than you really have. I didn't see the options, and I kept saying, “I don't see
                    these options—not now.” I mean, these things are not going to be realizable,
                    except for the National Guard, which we went down the line with. And then it
                    folded in on us.</p>
                <p>So it was a very interesting—I mean, I've never seen so many flash, top-secret
                    cables. I never saw that many in my life. We would have these drills, as you
                    know, overseas. But I was sending three or four flash cables a day, and getting
                    six or seven in return. It was just incredible. It was an embassy under siege;
                    we had no women there and no families. We had a small security detachment from
                    Panama, for emergency.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A marine detachment?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>PEZZULO: Well, for an emergency evacuation, because we were sitting in a
                    compound.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there fighting in the city of Managua?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Yes, when I arrived there I couldn't land in the city—I couldn't land at
                    the airport because the airport was cut off from the city. The Sandinistas were
                    in-between. So I flew in, in a small airplane, that dropped me off at a landing
                    strip on the coast and took off.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And there you were!</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Yes. And they picked me up in a car, and drove me up to the capital.
                    That lasted for two days. Then the siege ended because the Sandinistas had
                    really put themselves in a very exposed position, and they retreated one evening
                    to the city of Masaya. But there was constant firing—shooting. The major battles
                    were out, away from the city; although there was a constant closing in on the
                    city. You felt as if you were in this little enclave, which was not going to
                    hold too long; and that if you were going to strike a deal, and get this thing
                    done, you had better get on with it.</p>
                <p>And what struck me then was how—and I think it's true, and I'm sure from your own
                    career you'll see the similarities—the field tends to have a different view of
                    the world from Washington. And it's just a natural reality. You're sitting one
                    place, and they're sitting in another.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It takes about two days for the transition to occur, when
                        you got from the headquarters out to the field.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: And of course, under these circumstances it was even more dramatic—the
                    differences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your sense that things were moving very fast and you
                        didn't have a lot of options, whereas in Washington, there was a sense that
                        we still had things we could accomplish, and time to do it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: And time to do it. And that you could sit down and go through this in a
                    very orderly manner. It just wasn't there. But it was an exciting—it was just a
                    very fascinating period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you in touch with others besides Somoza? Or did you
                        have to deal primarily with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>PEZZULO: No, I talked to a lot of people. I met most of these wise men, who were
                    squirreled away around the city, and we'd go out and find them. I spoke to the
                    Archbishop as much as I could. In fact, the two of us were caught in the middle
                    of a firefight. I was talking to him and they started a fire-fight around us,
                    and we had to break off our discussion.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his name?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Obando y Bravo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The present one?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Yes, he was then an archbishop. He became a cardinal, I guess, about
                    four years ago. I had known him before, and he was one of the first people I
                    called on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obando y Bravo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Yes. A very nice gentleman. He's gotten harder as time has gone on,
                    because life has become difficult for him. But he's a sage old gentleman, who
                    watches, and listens, and was very, very critical of Somoza for a long time. So
                    I conferred with him just to get a sense of what he saw happening. And I told
                    him what we were doing; I wanted him to know. I said, “This is what I'm doing,
                    and I want you to understand if there's any question in your mind. This is the
                    route we're on.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, that's a fine route. Try to get this war ended. This country is
                    bleeding to death. And anything I can do I'll be glad to do.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He would have liked to see Somoza leave, I suppose?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Absolutely. Oh, he was working hard eight months before, during the
                    mediation effort. He was trying to do everything possible to get the mediation
                    to succeed. He saw it for what it was: the last really peaceful chance to end
                    that conflict.</p>
                <p>And I met with other politicians. I met with the few diplomats that remained;
                    there weren't many left, because it was a war zone. But we'd meet for lunch, or
                    we'd meet one another in the office. But it was not the kind of place you could
                    go out and wander around in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the National Guard you didn't meet with, because they
                        were out fighting the war.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>PEZZULO: They were out fighting. And then they had curfew from five o'clock in
                    the evening, until—I think it was eight o'clock the next morning. So you were
                    buttoned up in the evening. It was very restricted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you had no contact, I assume, with the insurgent
                        forces?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Oh no. Well, one of the things interesting is that in this—remember I
                    told you about this meeting we had in San Jos�, in May. I asked then what we
                    were doing with this leftist group—the Sandinistas then had a name; because
                    before then they weren't called the Sandinistas, it was just sort of a melange
                    of different leftist groups. I was told that we had no contacts. We had never
                    talked to them, which just shocked the pants off of me. I said, “I can't believe
                    this. You tell me we're not talking to these people?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At a time when you physically could have, before the war
                        actually began.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Oh sure, sure. Well, it turned out that a lot of the people that we had
                    been dealing with before were closet Sandinistas, but we didn't know that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It just sounds as though we didn't really have a very
                        thorough understanding of what was going on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: We didn't have our ear to the ground. That embassy, I think, was a
                    failure. I don't know why, but we never considered Nicaragua a very important
                    country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they must have had a station there, and CIA
                        people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: The station was not too active in Nicaragua, interestingly because they
                    didn't trust Somoza. And we had an ambassador—back during the early seventies,
                    up through the time when Nixon left office, and then he was removed—who used to
                    pass things to Somoza all the time. So the station was very concerned about too
                    much information going through.</p>
                <p>Somoza—you have to keep in mind was really wired into our system in a way that's
                    hard to understand. Well, you can see that from Congressman Murphy. But he had
                    very good intelligence on what we were doing at the highest levels. And, you
                    know, for that reason a lot of people were very intimidated by Somoza. Because
                    he could pull levers. In fact, one day he—I think it was about the third or
                    fourth conversation we had—he called Washington, and tried to open a dialogue
                    there. And he was told, “You've got our man, you talk to PEZZULO.”</p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>Washington called me and said, “We just wanted you to know that.”</p>
                <p>And the next time I walked in he said, “Hey, you've got a lot of power, don't
                    you?” He said, “They told me from Washington I've got to deal with you.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But he was used to being able to . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Sure, always did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: . . . to go over the head of the embassy.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Yes, sure. He did that all the time, I think. He always had somebody in
                    Washington he could appeal to, and then he could play with our ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these people in the executive branch of the
                        government? Were they congressmen?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Well, certainly Murphy—Murphy I knew. But no, he had people in . . .
                    I'll tell you a very interesting story, that shows you how good this guy was.
                    The day before I left, when it was finally decided I should go in . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The day you left Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Before I left Washington, yes. We were in the White House situation
                    room, and the military man there—I think it was—I can't think of his name now,
                    but he was the head of the Joint Chiefs at the time. He said, “Larry, why don't
                    you take in a military officer with you because, you know, Somoza was a West
                    Pointer, and maybe we can get you somebody who knew him.”</p>
                <p>And I said okay. He called my office when I got back, and he said, “There's going
                    to be a Colonel so-and-so coming to see you.” I said fine.</p>
                <p>In walked this colonel within two hours, and he said, “I understand I'm going to
                    go into Nicaragua.”</p>
                <p>And we started to talk, and I said, “You know what we're going to do?”</p>
                <p>And he said, “I understand.”</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>I said, “I'm going in there to get him out. If you have any problems with that, I
                    mean, if that causes you any grief let me know, because I don't want you to have
                    any questions.”</p>
                <p>He said, “No, no. I'm a career man, and I'll do whatever you tell me. I'll follow
                    you right down.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Fine.” So he went off to get his affairs in order, and we were supposed
                    to meet again the next day, and prepare to leave.</p>
                <p>And the next morning I'm walking down to Christopher's office, with Pete Vaky
                    walking along, and he said, “Larry, why did you agree to take in a military
                    man?”</p>
                <p>I said, “Pete, I wasn't thinking and you know, I thought it was okay.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Do you really want anybody?”</p>
                <p>I said, “I feel more comfortable alone, to tell you the truth. I don't know this
                    guy.”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, let's tell Christopher.”</p>
                <p>So we walked into Christopher's office, and Pete said, “Look, Chris, you know
                    Larry doesn't really want this colonel with him. He met him yesterday, and he'd
                    be better off alone.” He said, “I can give him somebody.” And he did. He gave me
                    one of his people who was very good and helped me a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Pete Vaky gave you one of his people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Yes, an officer in the Latin America Bureau named Barnaby.</p>
                <p>So we called off the colonel; Christopher called right then. It was General
                    Rogers—Air Force General.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Chief of Staff?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Chief of Staff. So I go in and see Somoza. And remember, I told you the
                    first time I went in, he commented, “You're alone?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>PEZZULO: It didn't strike me then. Four days later—about the fourth meeting
                    later, he said to me, “Where's Colonel . . .”</p>
                <p>I said, “I never heard of such a colonel.”</p>
                <p>That's how good he is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. He had a lot better intelligence than we had.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Yes, very good. And I think one of the unfortunate things in all of this
                    is that there were times when people talk about possibilities, and options—you
                    know how this is, you start talking and throwing out ideas. There were some
                    people who said a few things about the possibility of a U.S. input of troops
                    under certain circumstances. And I remember Vance, at the time, got furious. He
                    said, “I don't want to hear that. That's something the United States is not
                    going to do. That situation does not warrant it.”</p>
                <p>I think—I think that sort of wove through the bureaucracy somewhere. I think
                    somebody, somewhere said, “Look, as a contingency, can somebody just do . . .”
                    You know how these things are—”Can you do sort of a contingency plan, if in case
                    . . .” That's enough. That, I think, would have been known, and I think a guy
                    like Anastasio Somoza would have found out about it. Because it made sense. I
                    think he thought that at the eleventh hour—he kept saying it in different ways:
                    “Are you people really prepared to do this?” I think he thought when it came to
                    the crunch, we couldn't face the possibility of losing him, and his regime, and
                    we would bring in troops.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So your job, really, was to convince him that that wasn't
                        so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: I never thought, you know, that he held that as deeply. I thought it was
                    something he was trying to get us to consider. But I think it was a stronger—I'm
                    saying, if—and it's a strong possibility—this was made in a casual way, and
                    somebody said, “Well, let's make a contingency plan,” and it was done in the
                    Pentagon—given his ties into our military, which were historic . . .</p>
                <p>You see, he was a West Point graduate. He was very close to a lot of military
                    officers, and cultivated them. It is altogether possible that somebody was
                    available to tell him that kind of thing. “Look, Tacho, I just want you to know
                    that these plans are in place.” And that would have been enough to convince him
                    that if push came to shove, the United States was going to take some military
                    action, which would have given him a certain comfort, that he had friends up
                    there who would take care of him.</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>See, he'd lived through scrapes before. Don't forget, this man had grown up as
                    the son of a dictator. There were ups and downs. There were administrations that
                    were more, you know, critical than others. But they'd always gotten through
                    them. And he was right in saying he'd always been a friend. During the Bay of
                    Pigs, where did we launch aircraft from? From Nicaragua. Where did we train?
                    Nicaragua. He'd been a friend in need; he'd carried our water. You couldn't deny
                    that. He felt that he was America's friend, and to some extent he was perfectly
                    right. So why not, in this hour of need, have some people push these crazy guys
                    in the administration—who didn't understand his value—to ultimately come to his
                    rescue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What finally convinced him that nobody was coming to his
                        rescue, and that he ought to step down and leave?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: I don't know. I think he may have carried it right to the end, and then
                    he finally left. And I'm not even saying that I could prove—because we'll never
                    prove—he died, he was killed several years later—that that was even in his mind.
                    But given the type of person he was, who had lived this charmed life and had had
                    a good relationship with the United States, there's no reason to think he didn't
                    feel that we could not live without him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But I suppose it was the deterioration of the local
                        military situation, finally, that convinced him there was no option.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: There was no option. I mean, he had no supplies. What happened in the
                    conflict was that you didn't have a war, you had a popular insurrection, which
                    is much worse than a war. The Sandinistas did not win a military victory. What
                    happened was cities and towns just rose up and went after the Guard. Little
                    kids, mothers, and daughters, and so on. And pretty soon the Guard was caught in
                    their barracks; they couldn't move, and then they'd starve them out, and fire
                    bomb them, and so on.</p>
                <p>Where the Guard met the Sandinistas as a military force, they beat them. They did
                    it in the southern zone, where there was really a set-piece battle. And there
                    was no movement on that front, ever. You know, they established a front—the
                    Sandinistas couldn't move. That's where Eden Pastora was the commander.</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>So he was facing the most impossible of circumstances. The populace had really
                    risen up against him, and were aiding and abetting these young people. So there
                    were a lot of illusions here. I mean, the illusion indulged in by the
                    Sandinistas is that they won a military victory, which was not true. The
                    Nicaraguan people rose up against their leader and threw him out, and they
                    happened to be—they, the Sandinistas—the armed vanguard of that. But they never
                    overthrew Somoza. They alone would never have done it. It was the Nicaraguan
                    people who overthrew Somoza. And that's what—no guard—no national force can ever
                    combat—you just can't combat your whole country: the little kids, the
                    wives—impossible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were called back before Somoza actually left, to
                        participate in a meeting in the White House?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: I was back twice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Twice?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: I was back twice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: July 1 and 2.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Yes, the first time was because one of these ideas about forming this
                    wise men's group had reached the point where people thought that it should be
                    considered again. And I went back to tell them it's no go—this thing is not
                    going to fly, and to forget it. So that was one crucial point.</p>
                <p>Then there was another meeting, shortly thereafter that—I'm not sure of the
                    date—which had to do with the expansion of the junta. The junta was announced in
                    San Jos�—a five-member junta. And the concept began to develop within Washington
                    circles, that we should expand it to include more moderates. And I was called up
                    to take part in those discussions.</p>
                <p>I found it, again, to be sort of a nothing discussion. I mean, what's the
                    difference if you have five or seven? Anyway, this is the kind of thing that
                    Washington was putting a lot of attention into. So they talked and talked and
                    talked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Carter, and Vance, and Brzezinski?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Vance and Carter were really outside of this. It really came out of the
                    NSC.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: It was Brzezinski and his staff that really were very hot to trot.</p>
                <p>The second visit was for the purpose of discussing the enlarging of the junta,
                    from the five that they had begun with—to a larger number, to include more
                    moderates. And again, I felt that this was, sort of, a marginal issue of no
                    great consequence, because the key was going to be that the people with the guns
                    were going to have the power, and whether you now had five people in the junta,
                    or seven people, or all moderates, or all leftists—you know, I didn't see that
                    this was a major issue. But again, there was a sense of a great deal of urgency
                    about this.</p>
                <p>When I went up on it, there was a long discussion, and Carter then addressed it
                    to Torrijos, who had come in to meet on this particular issue.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Torrijos, the President—well, the dictator from Panama, who had been in
                    and out of this issue all along; conferring with us, and doing some of the
                    negotiating, and some of the helpful work, at the same time that he was
                    supporting the Sandinistas in military assistance.</p>
                <p>And what happened out of the whole thing is that we did recommend that some—I
                    know I, myself, Pete Vaky, were not all that hot on it, but it was recommended
                    to Carter. He recommended it to Torrijos. Torrijos raised it with the
                    Sandinistas, and they turned it down. And then when they turned it down, he told
                    them it was an American plan. So the whole thing was a bust.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: End of . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: End of episode, yes. In the meantime we had put together, basically, the
                    scenario for Somoza leaving. And the scenario was, fundamentally, that he would
                    turnover power, constitutionally, to a senator. He selected a fellow named
                    Urcuyo, who was an unknown sort of hanger-on, with no great consequence.</p>
                <p>But Urcuyo, then, was to go through the process that we had laid out; he was to
                    invite the junta from San Jos� to come to Managua. The junta was going to come
                    in, accompanied by the archbishop of Managua, as well as members of the
                    international community. Which were going to include Ambassador Bowdler, the
                    foreign ministers of Venezuela, the Dominican Republic, and Costa Rica, and
                    whomever else.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>The idea was to have a goodly number of people present from the international
                    community, to give it a—make it a moment in history. At that point there would
                    be a press conference right at the airport, and they would discuss the process
                    of transition, which would take place over the next several days; where Urcuyo
                    would hand over power to this transitional government—the junta in San Jos�.</p>
                <p>And then they would follow through on the promises they had made to the OAS, that
                    they would begin—they would take power, and then call for early elections, and
                    so on, which they of course failed to do. In the meantime, the military
                    commanders would meet, and talk about stand-down, merging the forces, and so
                    on.</p>
                <p>Well, this was explained to Somoza in a very detailed way. By this point in time,
                    the commander had—the new Guard commander had been selected by us, with Somoza's
                    concurrence, and the concurrence of the Sandinistas, through the junta in San
                    Jos�. The new Guard commander was a lieutenant colonel, unknown to anybody—a
                    fellow named Mejia. All the Guard officers who were tainted by Somoza, which
                    included most all the lieutenant colonels, and colonels, were all retired in one
                    official act, and Mejia was made commander of the National Guard. So that was
                    taken care of.</p>
                <p>So Urcuyo was to take charge of the country; have it turned over to him. He was
                    then to invite the junta from San Jos�, and a whole series of things were to
                    happen. Somoza left at three o'clock in the morning—the morning of the 17th.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see him off?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: No. Before that he had had the ceremony in which he had passed the baton
                    to Urcuyo. Urcuyo, then, was supposed to do a series of things. By about
                    six-thirty in the morning—or six o'clock in the morning, we saw the thing
                    unraveling. I got to him. And he had been through two meetings, where we went
                    through every one of these issues. He claimed to be ignorant of all these
                    things, and said, “I don't understand this. I'm the President of Nicaragua.”</p>
                <p>I said, “Well, that's understood . . .” Well, anyway, it was then that I made
                    that—told Washington that Somoza had backed away from the agreement, and this
                    triggered the call from Christopher to Somoza in Miami. Somoza then quickly
                    chartered two yachts, and got out of the United States. But he had clearly given
                    Urcuyo the other message, that you know, he was to stay on; not let the
                    Communists come in, and goodness knows what.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>My theory is that Somoza was afraid that if he ever went to the Guard and said he
                    was leaving, and they were going to turnover power to the Sandinistas, they
                    would have killed him. And he lied to Urcuyo. Now, Urcuyo was just a plain liar,
                    because he sat in on two meetings when I explained the scenario step by step to
                    him, and then I had my DCM—Tom O'Donnell—go over to his hotel, and go through it
                    with him again, minutely. And he was just a plain, bald-faced liar. Mejia was
                    duped. I went to tell him that very day. Then I went up to see the President
                    with him, and we had a pretty stormy session. This was the second meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You and Mejia went to see Urcuyo—the President?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Yes, and he denied all of this, and said he was insulted, that I was
                    telling him what to do, and all this kind of nonsense. By this time I think
                    Mejia was starting to smell a rat, plus the National Guard was starting to
                    collapse. I told Urcuyo. I said, “My friend, you're going to be a president
                    without a country. What are you talking about? This thing will not hold. It will
                    only hold under the scenario we set up. That's all agreed—with the Sandinistas,
                    with everybody. You can't do this.”</p>
                <p>So it began to collapse. A day later he ran out of the country. Then because it
                    was collapsing, I made the recommendation to Washington that I had to be pulled
                    out right away, with some part of the embassy, accompanied by a public
                    statement, criticizing Somoza for having broken the pact. Because if we didn't
                    do that, it would look as if this was our plan all along. They agreed, and I
                    left on the morning of the 18th.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the next morning.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: That's right, the next morning—afternoon actually—well, it was about
                    eleven o'clock. Tom, then, was there to just hold this little group together. He
                    met with Mejia—by this time Urcuyo had fled the country—Mejia said, you know,
                    “Can I meet with Humberto Ortega, to see if we can work this out?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ortega was considered, even then, to be the head of . .
                        .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: The head of the forces.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The head of the junta military.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>PEZZULO: The military arm. But it was too late, and Mejia had nothing to deal
                    with; he had no armed forces left. His air force had run away, his infantry had
                    run out to Honduras, and the poor devil was stuck. So he eventually got on a
                    plane and flew to Guatemala. It was over. I mean, there was no—the National
                    Guard had disappeared. And then you had the Sandinistas just drive into the
                    country, and drive up to the capital on the 17th, and take over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: I went to Panama. I took part of the embassy to Panama.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a demonstration of . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: That we had been betrayed by Somoza. We put out a public announcement
                    stating that the plan that we had put together with Somoza, and had coordinated
                    with the Sandinistas, had been aborted by Somoza. That was clear.</p>
                <p>Then they asked me to come to Washington. And when I got to Washington, I asked
                    Pete to request agreement from the new government in Managua. Because I never
                    submitted my credentials to Somoza; I went down there without anything. That was
                    Bill Bowdler's idea. He said, “You shouldn't be dealing with him as ambassador;
                    you should be dealing with him as a special . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Envoy from Washington.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Special envoy. So I went without the courtesy of any presentation of
                    credentials, even though I had bought a white suit. You used to want to
                    present—I still have the damn white suit. (Laughs)</p>
                <p>So I demanded that we get approval from the new government, because I didn't know
                    what their attitude would be, and I felt—you know—since we're going to start
                    anew, we'd better get this clear right from the outset. And they accepted right
                    away. And I went down.</p>
                <p>In fact, I flew down on a C-141, out of Andrews, that was filled with food.
                    Because there was a food deficit, and we began flying food in right toward the
                    end, and kept flying in. So it was sort of a dramatic act to go back in with a
                    plane-load of food. So I flew in with a C-141. Landed. Met at the airport by
                    Tomas Borge, of all people.</p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>We had a conversation at the airport. And I presented my credentials, I think,
                    two days later. They had a date for me right away. And I told the junta—they
                    were all there, except one—that we looked to a period where we could develop a
                    relationship. The United States understood the trauma the country had gone
                    through. We thought we had played a role in trying to prevent any further
                    bloodshed. We took it upon ourselves to feel a certain amount of pride in that.
                    But we want to help, in a meaningful way, the new administration. And we were
                    prepared to look at aid packages, and so on and so on.</p>
                <p>And shortly thereafter, we gave them some money. Their treasury was bare; we gave
                    them some hard cash right away. And we started opening up some programs that had
                    been frozen during the Somoza period. And slowly began . . . Well, the food was
                    coming in all the time, by the way. And then we began working on the longer-term
                    programs.</p>
                <p>You're right, in the sense that what was portrayed in the press was exactly what
                    people were saying. “What are these? Aren't they Communists? How do we deal with
                    them?” In fact, when I came back to Washington shortly after the fall of Somoza,
                    they put me downstairs with the spokesman. The first question was, “Are these
                    people Communists?” And the position we were taking at the time was, “Look, we
                    don't want to prejudge something like this. Let their actions speak for what
                    they are. These people have gone through a terribly painful period. The
                    Nicaraguan people have suffered. And we're going to take them at their word,
                    that they're going to put a democratic administration into being. But during
                    this period of need we're going to be as helpful as we can. And we're not going
                    to be driven to make judgments about it.”</p>
                <p>And we held to that. Pete [Vaky] and I were up in the Congress, shortly
                    thereafter, giving testimony. And this is basically the line Pete took, and I
                    took.</p>
                <p>Now, confidentially, when we talked to people, and what I was reporting back was:
                    first of all there was no question there was deep-seeded animosity toward the
                    United States in this group. I started getting around to see all the
                    commanders—nine commanders—and the foreign minister, who was a former
                    Maryknoll—well, he was a Maryknoll at the time. Escoto, who bore a tremendous
                    amount of resentment against the United States, even though he was born in the
                    United States, and speaks English as well as anybody. Viscerally anti-American,
                    in almost an emotional way. Interestingly, because his father was a Somoza
                    diplomat, and a slavish Somoza diplomat.</p>
                <p>You felt it all through this, this rebellious quality. A young man resenting the
                    failings of his parents. And what I tried to do was to show that, you know, a
                    mature power—a major power can understand change, can understand young people
                    wanting to transform a country. That we thought we were not the ones to judge
                    that. But there were certain things that had to be understood, in terms of a
                    relationship.</p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>So I kept the tough issues to a very bilateral kind of thing. And in public we
                    were supportive, and we were trying our best to give whatever assistance was
                    needed. They responded, I thought, quite well, given what they thought we were;
                    you know, suddenly finding themselves in a governing role. They were—and
                    Nicaraguans in general—are very gracious people; they happen to be that kind of
                    people. So you can meet with them, and the conversations will always be at least
                    civilized. Even though they got heated, they were civilized. And they really
                    respected the fact that we had done some of the things we did; they respected
                    that. But they resented, very much, the long-term support of Somoza, and so on.
                    So you'd have to go through that.</p>
                <p>And the questions that arose early were, you know, what are these bunch of guys?
                    I mean, are they going to work themselves into a lather? Are they going to ever
                    turnover power to anybody? And what's the role going to be of the Cubans, and so
                    on.</p>
                <p>Well, it wasn't too long before it became clear that the Cubans had an in that
                    nobody was going to compete with. The Cubans had fought with them; the Cubans
                    were their military advisors. The Cubans are very good at ingratiating
                    themselves because they know the culture. And Castro was bigger than life to
                    them. To them there were very few heroes that they could think of that would
                    supersede Castro. So that quality was there. And I think all of them, sort of,
                    aspired to be pint-sized Castros.</p>
                <p>So you saw that at the same time you were hoping that there was a learning curve
                    here, and that these people would understand that governing is not just a
                    question of, you know, making speeches, and acting like a popinjay. But the
                    chances of this thing ever moving democratic were very slim. And that I reported
                    early, even though I thought we should constantly push on it, constantly remind
                    them what they promised, constantly talk about the human rights, and free press,
                    and so on. And we made a big fetish of that. I mean, I never had anybody come
                    into that country that we didn't go past La Prensa and visit. And they knew
                    exactly what that meant.</p>
                <p>And we made a big to-do about human rights. I went to their independent human
                    rights commission, which was investigating every abuse, and so on. I went out to
                    their jails early, to look at them. You know, I just made a big, major effort to
                    have them understand that we didn't have our eyes closed. And when we spoke, I
                    used to speak quite honestly about it. That they made a hell of a mistake by
                    having so many people in jail. That they'd taken on a burden that was going to
                    leech them for no good reason. And over the long term, it was going to cost them
                    more than they'd ever be able to recover from—whatever security concerns it
                    addressed.</p>
                <p>I lectured them about security. I said, you know, “I've been around enough
                    security people to tell you they give you bad advice almost all the time.” And I
                    said, “Watch the intelligence people that you're getting from Cuba. Because you
                    think they're wiring for you; I'm telling you, they're wiring you for sound.”
                    And you get some interesting responses back.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>I found two things that we had to worry about. One was their export of
                    revolution. Because they were fascinated by the romantic idea that they were the
                    new revolutionaries. Castro told them, “You're the new generation.” This guy is
                    a—you know, he's a world-class snake oil salesman. He really is a
                    mesmerizer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You met him, didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Yes, he's a mesmerizer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The first anniversary . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: He's a real, real article; but he's a snake oil salesman. No matter how
                    good he is, he's a snake oil salesman. He convinced these guys that they had
                    brought about a new concept of revolution. His (Cuba) was almost an antiquated
                    model; this (Nicaragua) was the new model, see, and the new model had two new
                    elements in it. One was religion; it had the church. And the second—it had
                    people from the private sector. In other words, it was a total societal
                    overthrow. And it had all the elements of a new revolution. But this was
                    baloney. They were just taken in by this. And they were taken by the idea that
                    they could play a role way beyond Nicaragua.</p>
                <p>In fact, I remember one of them was telling me—I think it was Humberto Ortega. He
                    said, “You know, you are very fortunate to be here at this time. Because you can
                    see from us, you know, how things are going to play out all through Latin
                    America.” He said, “We're going to be the model all through Latin America.”
                    Well, you know, when you get a young guy—32 years old, who has just become all
                    blown up with euphoria, who attained power because of the fortunes of the draw—I
                    mean, the Sandinistas didn't win a victory, they just slid in on a series of
                    circumstances, that just were fortuitous for them. Nonetheless, it gave them
                    this heady feeling that the whole gosh-dang continent was going in their
                    direction, Chile, and all the rest of Latin America. They felt, “We are the
                    center of the universe.”</p>
                <p>Now what was happening, which made this thing very credible to them—every cuckoo
                    nut around the world was there. We had extremists from Peru. We had the
                    Montoneros from Argentina. Miristas from Chile. The Tupamaros from Uruguay. We
                    had the PLO. We had North Koreans; it was the first time I saw the North
                    Koreans. We had revolutionaries from Africa. I mean, you walked
                    around—especially at the Intercontinental Hotel—and it looked like some sort of
                    a Hollywood stage.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>Then you had all the people who were looking for happenings. You know, Hollywood
                    starlets, and musicians, and goodness knows who else. They were all there. And
                    these guys were booted up to stardom. They were heady as hell. They really
                    believed they were supermen. It was very dangerous; it seemed to me it was very
                    dangerous for these people to think that they could do these things, when they
                    couldn't even run the country. Nicaragua was in terrible shape.</p>
                <p>And I used to talk to them about relations with their neighbors, and relations
                    with us. Basically the line I took was that they should attend to their own
                    needs at home. That became problematic. I mean, it was there right in the
                    beginning. And they would argue at great length that, you know, you don't
                    understand that there's sort of a harmonic feeling here, throughout this region.
                    And all these other societies are not going to make it; they're going to topple.
                    And I'd say, “You're going to pay a price. We are not going to sit idly by.
                    Forget it.” You know, “If you want this regime to survive, you better tend to
                    your own business. As long as you tend to your own business, at least people can
                    be tolerant of some of the screeching. But if you start fooling around . .
                    .”</p>
                <p>“Oh, well, we're not doing quite that.” Well, this became central, and I think
                    it's always been the central issue; just how much they were going to intrigue
                    and get themselves involved in other countries. And ultimately, I think it led
                    them into problems that have beset them ever since.</p>
                <p>Now, they come to power in July of 1979. In March, 1980 the presidential
                    campaigns began in the United States. The Republican platform contained a plank
                    identifying the Nicaraguan Sandinistas as Marxist Leninists, and so on and so
                    on—that we would not tolerate them, and so on. So you had that in the mix right
                    away.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, Reagan wins in the election, and that starts to turn events even
                    further than they would have gone, I think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What kind of a position did that put you in personally,
                        with your contacts there? This seemed to show a face of an America that you
                        hadn't been representing to them.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: At first nobody understood what it would mean. I didn't have any idea,
                    either. The only people that ever came down there were some real creeps, that
                    had been tied up with groups out of Arizona.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right wing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>PEZZULO: Right wing, yes. This was the Santa Fe group, and they had people who
                    went out, did some writing. A couple of, sort of, agency people, who had been in
                    the agency; and a couple of other people wandering around. People from Helms's
                    staff came down. But you didn't have any sense of where it was going.</p>
                <p>Then, of course, things appeared in the press in early December, that there was a
                    hit-list of ambassadors, who were going to be replaced. And one was Bob White,
                    and I was on the hit-list, and so on.</p>
                <p>You know, I could feel there was some wave sweeping through Washington, that was
                    going to make this damn thing impossible. I did get hold of Haig. I went up to
                    Washington in December, and met with Secretary Muskie. I just happened to walk
                    by his office, and I wanted to say goodbye. And he invited me in and wanted to
                    talk. And we talked at length. And I told him about this business. And he said,
                    “Oh, you've got to talk to Haig.” He said, “Let me call him. I find him to be a
                    reasonable man.”</p>
                <p>Eventually, I got to Haig, and spoke to him. And I told him I would retire,
                    resign. I mean, I was not going to be party to this, if they wanted to do that.
                    He said, “No, no, no. I don't want you to do that.” He said, “I know about your
                    work, and I want you to stay there, and I want you to give me your best
                    advice.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Well, fine, I'll stay there.” I didn't want to stay there long,
                    because I had gotten a commitment—even from the Carter administration—that I'd
                    leave in August—the summer of 1981. I mean, it was an exhausting job. You were
                    really a grind, you know, putting up with the propaganda, and then trying to get
                    these people to behave rationally. Then fighting in Congress for money, and
                    having them traipse out all the stupid statements these people were making all
                    the time. You were fighting on all sides all the time. So I figured two and a
                    half years was enough. And I had asked to be relieved in the summertime, and
                    they said fine.</p>
                <p>So when I saw Haig, I said, “That was the commitment, I'll stay through the
                    summer.” And he was fairly decent. And I went up in February, again, when they
                    were in office. And already the State Department had transformed itself. They
                    were already changing positions. I went up, and they had cut off all the
                    assistance. And I went to Haig, and I said, “Look, what the heck are we doing?
                    You know, let's do this . . . You know, if we want to sanction this bunch, then
                    you don't need me. I mean, I think we can still work these guys. That's what I
                    like to do, sort of angle them a little bit. I'm not saying they're going to
                    turn Nicaragua into Connecticut, but I think we can deal with these fellows. And
                    I think we can prevent them from doing stupid things, and causing problems in
                    the hemisphere. I think that's a cheaper way to go about it, than to get into
                    some sort of John Wayne approach. You're going to lose going down that
                    track.”</p>
                <p>He said, “I buy that.”</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He did? That's interesting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: He did, in February. What I didn't know, was that he was, at the same
                    time, agreeing to begin this covert program. I suspected it, because I'd heard
                    some funny things were going on. The complete openness I enjoyed before was
                    changing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: In Washington. I mean, Vance was great. Muskie was great. People around
                    him were very forthcoming. Even the NSC, that was a little problematic at first,
                    understood that this was an antsy situation. They really gave me my head. They
                    said, you know, “Follow wherever you think you can go with it.” Nobody knew
                    where the hell to go with it. (Laughs) You sort of had to move it along.</p>
                <p>Well, then suddenly I could see this was not going to continue. I mean, the week
                    after I went to see Haig, and he tells me, “Look, I'll follow you. Just keep me
                    informed,” I went to see a member of the junta one day, on something, and he
                    said, “Why do we have to get insulted by you people?”</p>
                <p>And I said, “What do you mean, insulted? What happened?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, there was a diplomatic reception in the State Department. And our
                    representative was there, and your Secretary of State went up to her and put his
                    finger in her face, and said . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is a Nicaraguan saying this to you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Yes. This was one of the members of the governing junta. I think it was
                    Sergio Ramirez. He stuck his finger in her face, and said, “You better tell the
                    boys down south, you know, your government, that they better behave themselves,
                    otherwise they're really going to be in for it.” Allegedly, Haig had made the
                    threat in front of other diplomats.</p>
                <p>I said, “I can't believe this.” Then I checked it out; later it turned out that
                    he did insult the Nicaraguan Ambassador. And, you know, what the hell?</p>
                <p>Ramirez said, “You know, we've had a tough enough time just working this thing
                    through.” I called up, and I asked—I don't know who was there, I think Enders at
                    that time, or somebody—and it was true.</p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>I said, “What the hell was that for? What do we accomplish by sophomoric
                    insults?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Well, you know, the Secretary . . .” But Haig was like that. You never
                    knew what he was going to say.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Haig himself who . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: This was Haig. And he'd go off and have a press conference, and blow off
                    some steam. So it was clear to me you just couldn't hold this baby. I mean, this
                    was going to be some sort of a showboat up in Washington, playing for some other
                    game, and you were just some sort of a popinjay. I started pressing hard to get
                    out of there. I called Enders, and . . . But they didn't want to respond. I
                    mean, Enders was busy with other matters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was Assistant Secretary then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Well, he was delayed in being confirmed for a long time because he had
                    problems with—I think he had problems with Helms. But he was held up. But he was
                    sitting there. But he was not official. And he had Steve Bosworth, who is just a
                    first class guy. And Steve became, basically, the guy I worked with. I didn't
                    know Steve, but Steve was a pro. And I used to tell Steve, you know, “You tell
                    Tom that I'm leaving here.” Nobody was talking about orders. I figured this is
                    crazy; I'm just going to be left here, and they'll work around me, and I might
                    just as well be in Ohio, for all the good I'm going to do.</p>
                <p>And then, the relationship really started to go sour. Because the Sandinistas
                    realized that I wasn't playing a major role anymore. They could see—the
                    Sandinistas—that before, at least, I was representing an administration; the
                    administration was in line with what I was saying. Now, I was just somebody who
                    was representing the United States of America, but I was not representing the
                    administration. So the whole things became less real, and it wasn't any fun
                    anymore. So I wanted to get out, and I pressed hard.</p>
                <p>And finally, I called to Washington, and made the arrangements to go to the
                    University of Georgia. I mean, nobody was doing it for me. I called. I said, “Do
                    you have one of those Diplomats in Residence slots? I want to go off for a
                    year.”</p>
                <p>They looked around, and said, “Yes, we can get you to Georgia. How's that
                    sound?”</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>I said, “Fine, cut the orders. Tell Tom.” And I called and said, “Look, they have
                    offered me this. I think it's good. And I'm going to be leaving on this date.”
                    And I encouraged Tom to come down—well, I encouraged somebody to come down, and
                    he decided to come. And he was good. And he saw that you could deal with the
                    Sandinistas.So I kept pushing for someone to come down. I felt someone—they were
                    not naming an ambassador. I mean, I was going to leave, and there was no
                    movement to name anybody. And I felt at least someone from Washington should
                    come down, and get a sense of this. So I urged Bosworth. I said, “You come down,
                    Steve.”</p>
                <p>And finally, he called me one day, and he said, “Tom is coming.”</p>
                <p>And I said, “Great.” And he came down, and you know, Tom can speak for himself on
                    this . . .</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's Tom Enders?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Tom Enders. You know, he's a tough cob, but he's an intelligent man. And
                    he came down, and I'm convinced he thought it would be something different. And
                    he found that you could hit these guys right between the eyes with a bat, and
                    they'd come right back and talk to you. I mean, they're not the kind that get up
                    and walk out of the room, which I like. And he laid it out for them. And, in
                    effect, said, “You know, we're coming to a crossroads with you guys. And if we
                    don't reach an accommodation, it's going to be a problem for you. Because we're
                    a big country, and I'm just telling you. I don't want to threaten you, but the
                    fact of the matter is, we can hurt you.”</p>
                <p>And they went back, and you know, all the recriminations about you people are
                    doing this, and that, and the other thing; you don't understand, and you accuse
                    us of this, and that, and the other thing. And all these statements you made in
                    Washington—your President, your Secretary of State. So it went back and forth,
                    back and forth.</p>
                <p>And that evening we—we went through a real day, and at the end of it we were at
                    the DCM's house—we had a little reception with the business community. And they
                    left. And he said, “What do you think?”</p>
                <p>I said, “What do you think?”</p>
                <p>He said, “Interesting.” He said, “You really can talk with these guys.”</p>
                <p>I said, “I told you that.” I said, “I think you can cut a deal, Tom.”</p>
                <p>And he said, “What's the deal?”</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>I said, “Well, the deal is very simple. You know, they're scared to death that
                    we're going to come down on them. And we don't want these guys fiddling around
                    in other countries. And we don't want to see them building up their armed force
                    any bigger than it is. They're becoming a police state, and they're becoming a
                    threat to everybody around. They've succeeded in giving their neighbors the
                    jitters.” I said, “The deal, very simply, is they make a commitment to stop
                    exporting revolution of any sort. And they contain their armed forces at a level
                    we mutually agree to, which has to be in conformity with other armed forces in
                    the area.” And they were all about, you know, 15,000, or 17,000. I said, “You
                    know, you pick a number out of the hat.”</p>
                <p>“And we on our side, make a commitment that we will not mount any attack on them.
                    In other words, a mutual security type of agreement.”</p>
                <p>He said, “I'll try it.” So he went to see Ortega alone—Ortega wanted to see him
                    alone. And he told him, he said, “Now, how does that sound?”</p>
                <p>Ortega said, “I'll buy it.”</p>
                <p>So he left, and two days later I left. And I went to Europe for two weeks. Came
                    back through Washington. And Tom had a tough time getting—he had committed
                    himself to sending Ortega a draft of an agreement—something down on paper which
                    could then be negotiated—something they would negotiate. And he had a devil of a
                    time getting anything cleared, as you can imagine. Now, how much he knew about
                    what we were starting to do, in terms of covert action—I don't know. I mean, Tom
                    can speak to that. I don't know. I think it was in the wind then, and . . .</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Contra . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: Yes. What he ended up putting on paper was damned insulting, and crass.
                    When I looked at it, I said, “Holy crow.” I mean, you know, “You're asking these
                    people to close up shop and go away. I mean, it's a little strong. But maybe,
                    you know, as a negotiating position, they can handle it. I think it's
                    tough.”</p>
                <p>Well, they showed it to Arturo Cruz, who was then their ambassador to Washington,
                    and he said, “This is an insult.” Arturo is no hard-line man; I mean, he's a
                    very reasonable man.</p>
                <p>Well, Enders couldn't get anything through the administration in Washington, that
                    resembled anything like the beginning of a negotiation. It was really an
                    insulting attack.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They just wanted the Sandinistas to disappear.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>PEZZULO: Yes. I mean, that was clear that early, and it's still clear. I mean,
                    what the Reagan administration has wanted for the past eight years was to have
                    the Sandinistas disappear. They had this obsession that the Sandinistas were the
                    cause of all problems in Central America. That the Sandinistas were a problem,
                    there is no question. But they certainly were not at the core of all the
                    problems in Central America. The Sandinistas, by coming into power as a
                    revolutionary force, destabilized Central America. Their inflated rhetoric and
                    their support to other guerrilla groups were destabilizing; no question.
                    However, that was containable. But not by pursuing the Reagan administration's
                    line.</p>
                <p>What we've done in the process is turn this thing into some sort of a mindless
                    crusade, where other people now question our sanity, including our allies in
                    Europe; for a kind of a game that should have been played at a different level,
                    with a different tone, with toughness, hardness with these guys, with Fidel
                    Castro, with the Soviets. I think you had to talk tough turkey, and no fooling
                    around. But you needed pros to do it, and not ideologues, and people who think
                    diplomacy is rhetorical overkill.</p>
                <p>I mean, we went from a careful, calculated attempt to move a revolutionary
                    leadership a bit—to some sort of a circus. And that's deplorable. I mean, that
                    to me is the end of diplomacy. You've moved from professionalism to a theatrical
                    Hollywood spectacular. So now I don't know where you're going. I don't even know
                    how you'd begin the dialogue anymore.</p>
                <p>I was up at the Council (Council on Foreign Relations) last night, with a bunch
                    of people—including Elliott Abrams. There's no way to begin this discussion
                    anymore. And I went home just feeling, you know, where the hell do we go as a
                    country anymore? I mean, I don't want to defend anybody. I don't mind looking at
                    a problem; I'm not going to defend anybody. But I will look hard and honestly at
                    reality, and I think I can do it as well as the next guy.</p>
                <p>And that's what we need, you know, in diplomacy. We don't need brilliance, we
                    need people who are willing to go in and deal with the facts, and work with the
                    realities, and hopefully once in a while have an inspiration, or a little sense
                    of something. We don't need this, this is embarrassing. We've become a Banana
                    Republic.</p>
                <p>And what it does is take the play away from what I would consider the art form of
                    diplomacy, which I think is one of the more fascinating things you can do. This
                    weird game of one-upmanship, and vindictive sparring is degrading. I really
                    don't know—it takes us away from our strengths, as a people. I mean, our country
                    was made by guys who knew how to move things. I mean, that's what this country
                    was—you know, you brought people over here who came from countries that didn't
                    have a break, and they knew how to cut a road, and they knew how to plant crops,
                    and they knew how to do things. And half of them couldn't even speak well; it
                    didn't matter. You know, they opened shops, and worked. They were doers. They
                    were people that worked with their hands and raised families. It was not this
                    blasted rhetorical baloney. I mean, we're turning . . .</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is what they left behind in Europe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>PEZZULO: This is what they left behind; all the trappings, and all the phoniness.
                    It turns your stomach. I mean, I found—last night—I haven't been that depressed
                    in a long time. I went home last night, and I said, “Where do you go from here?”
                    I mean, I'm not going to engage in that kind of stuff.</p>
                <p>I wouldn't even hazard an honest comment to those people, because they're not
                    dealing with the kinds of things which I think are fundamental to understand
                    other societies and dealing with them. And that is, beginning with some sense
                    of, you know, what makes them pulse; and where the other personalities fit into
                    this. That's the intrigue to me.</p>
                <p>You know, how these things fit together, and how you can move them, and shape
                    them. And have them see where your—your country's interests, and your country's
                    attitudes can somehow find some common ground with theirs. I don't care whether
                    you're talking to Israelis, or Jordanians, or Chileans, or whomever. If you
                    can't reach that point of connection, there's nothing to talk about. If all I'm
                    going to do is call you names, or say you're a good guy and go home, you don't
                    need a diplomat. You can do this by telephone. (Laughs) Well, the end of that
                    speech, but it's just deplorable.</p>
                <p>One word about congressional relations, which I thought was a fascinating sort of
                    accident I fell into. Because Bob McCloskey, who I went to work for in '74,
                    suddenly became Assistant Secretary for Congressional Affairs, because Kissinger
                    was upset with the then-incumbent, who was a former governor of Maryland—no,
                    Virginia, I'm sorry. Bob had never done this kind of work, but Bob has a natural
                    sense of public affairs, and dealing with people, and institutions. He's just a
                    natural.</p>
                <p>And I went in with him, and we really changed the composition of H, because H
                    before was a little group of people who really didn't know much about the
                    Foreign Service, and foreign policy. These were people that had come in for one
                    reason or another over the last 15 years or so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: H was the . . .</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>PEZZULO: Congressional Relations Office. But you had no substantive people in H,
                    who knew anything about policy, or the concerns of the bureaus. So what we did
                    was enlarge it, to bring people in from each of the geographic regions, and IO,
                    EB, and so on. We brought in first-class officers to do congressional liaison.
                    They came with substance and could relate to bureaus with substance. Then they
                    could go out into Congress, which they didn't know, and start to feel their way.
                    And pretty soon they could relate to the processes on the Hill because they were
                    tied into the substance in the Department.</p>
                <p>And they became instructors, really. Because the Foreign Service has a reluctance
                    to deal with the Congress. Foreign Service Officers tend to be that way; they
                    don't really see the Hill as their natural habitat. But once you make them
                    understand that, you know, the way a committee's behaving, or questions it's
                    raising about whatever—the minute you start relating to them, and talking to
                    them, and providing them with some insight into what's going on—you do reach a
                    point, unless they're really antagonistic, where you satisfy their needs, and
                    you know, further your own purposes.</p>
                <p>So it was a very interesting period, and you get a sense of a branch of
                    government, which is unique. And each congressman is, sort of, a private
                    businessman. And they become—each one of them becomes somebody you've got to
                    study a bit, to get them to move for you. And the committee processes, and these
                    interminable discussions, and the torturous way bills move through the
                    system—it's just another world.</p>
                <p>But my point is, that the Foreign Service—and certainly people in the executive
                    department—should be exposed to the Congress. Because without that, our
                    country—especially on the foreign policy side—doesn't work. If you don't have
                    something resembling bipartisanship—and you can see how the Contra issue has
                    become such a mess, fundamentally because people just ignored what the opponents
                    on the Hill were saying. They thought that the President could move Congress,
                    and he can, but you pay a tremendously high cost. If you can't develop a
                    consensus there, that this is the direction in which the United States should
                    go, you're lost. You're just always going to be expending more energy trying to
                    fight the case than it's worth. And you're going to lose the policy in the
                    process. So I think it's fundamental, and it's fundamental to Foreign Service
                    Officers.</p>
                <p>And the last thing I'd like to say is that I really have—maybe it's old age—but
                    I'm starting to get a real concern about where the Service is going. When I came
                    in—at a period when the Foreign Service was, I thought, a glorious group of
                    capable people; when you didn't have to say a hell of a lot to have people
                    accept the fact that you had chosen a profession of quality. That was understood
                    within the government; you just—it was true. There happened to be a little bit
                    of snobbism, and elitism, which I never thought much of; but I think it goes
                    with that other. But there was a sense of esprit in the organization.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>I think it's gone through hard times, and I think when the Service forgets
                    that—you don't have to reward people for good performance all the time, but you
                    just can't cut them off at the knees and expect that kind of example not to be
                    read for what it is within the Service. And I think things have happened in the
                    last decade which have been deplorable. And you don't recoup easily. I mean,
                    courage is tough to come by in any profession. It's a scarce commodity. And
                    integrity is even scarcer. You just don't find that—you don't pay for it, you
                    don't build it overnight. And that's exactly what you need; you need courage and
                    integrity in FSO's.</p>
                <p>Because the Foreign Service does not have a big constituency. It doesn't have a
                    big budget, with a lot of goodies out there that you can sell to Congress. And
                    it's always fighting the kind of things—or presenting the kinds of issues that
                    people in Washington—particularly your political leaders—don't want to hear. So
                    you've got to be better than everybody else, to make the case; you've just got
                    to be better. It's not a question of—you don't have anything else, but integrity
                    and quality to go up and say, “Look, this is the way it is. I'm not saying it's
                    good, bad, or indifferent. This is the way it is. And these are the kinds of
                    things we're going to have to face. You know, we're going to have to make the
                    best of four lousy choices here. And this is the least lousy.”</p>
                <p>And then you're going to have to understand that those are the kinds of things
                    that are pressures to whatever administration—whoever walks into that White
                    House. But once you start cutting it in a way that people become echoes of
                    whatever they think the top guy is doing . . . As I say, this may be a little
                    bit of old age, and I don't deny that. But I just think it's deplorable to see
                    people who can't sit down and be honest about what's going on. And the minute
                    you lose the honesty of your sense of what is happening in a country, and how
                    the United States should be relating to it, then the rest goes with it. End of
                    sermon.</p>
