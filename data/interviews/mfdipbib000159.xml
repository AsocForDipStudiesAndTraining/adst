                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: February 23, 1998</p>
                <p>Copyright 2001 ADST</p>
                <p>Q: Today is February 23, 1998. This is an interview with Bilha Bryant. It's being
                    done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic Studies and Training. I'm
                    Charles Stuart Kennedy, and Bilha and I are old friends. Bilha, could you tell
                    me when and where you were born and tell us something about your family?</p>
                <p>BRYANT: I was born in Dupnitza, a small town in the foothills of the Rila
                    Mountains in Tsigonian, Bulgaria, in 1934. We lived there until our semi-forced
                    immigration to Israel, four years after the Communists took over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me about your family in Bulgaria and what you
                        remember,because you were 10 years old, weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Yes. But I remember quite a bit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: First tell me about your family, what your family was
                        involved in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: My paternal side, Sephardim (Spanish Jews), had lived in Bulgaria since
                    the exile from Spain. The family tried to observe Jewish traditions but knew
                    very little about Jewish religion and did not really practice it regularly. My
                    father was in a profession that was not deemed at the time “Jewish.” It involved
                    travel to villages and farms and very close contact with peasants who were all
                    Christians. He was a tobacco grower and exporter. My maternal grandfather, whom
                    I never knew since he died before I was born, was a miller and also dealt with
                    Bulgarian farmers. I do remember my maternal grandmother; tall, slim and
                    beautiful, and rather sad. Rumors were that she was not purely Jewish. After the
                    death of her husband, she was obliged to move in, for periods of 6 month a year,
                    with her two sons and their families. My paternal family was large and
                    close-knit, but not very happy, with a great deal of family feuding. The extreme
                    hierarchy in the family touched all of us, but mostly the women.</p>
                <p>Q: I take it there wasn't the equivalent of - I may be mispronouncing this - a
                    shtetl - in Bulgaria, a Jewish enclave, a small village or something like
                    that?</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>BRYANT: Bulgarian Jews were assimilated into the society and did not stand out as
                    Jews. They didn't speak Yiddish or go to the synagogue, except for the High Holy
                    Days. My own father had a lot of Christian friends from all levels of society.
                    It was not the same sort of Jewish community you saw in Poland or the Ukraine.
                    The old generation spoke Ladino, an ancient form of Spanish from the
                    14th-century when Queen Isabella kicked the Jews out of Spain.</p>
                <p>The separation was mainly economic: poor people lived across the river and very
                    few (before Communism) were able to “cross the bridge.” We visited the house I
                    grew up in Dupnitza. We left Bulgaria in November '48 and, as I said, left
                    everything behind. And now, 50 years later, there they were: the same sofa, the
                    same table and chairs, everything as we left it. The family that had taken over
                    the house continued to live there all these years. It was so eerie.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about schooling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Jewish children had to attend segregated Jewish elementary schools.
                    Looking back I am not sure why, since we were not taught anything very Jewish,
                    such as the Old Testament or Hebrew and when we reached middle school, Jews and
                    Christians attended the same schools and got along fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say you left there when, about '45 or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: No, we actually left in November of '48.</p>
                <p>Q: Well then, what about Bulgaria during the war years, because Bulgaria was an
                    ally of the Germans, of the Nazis, and of course, everyone knows what the Nazis
                    were doing to Jews? Did this impact on Bulgaria?</p>
                <p>BRYANT: Comparatively speaking, Bulgarian Jews were very lucky. The combination
                    of the reluctance of Tzar (King) Boris to allow our deportation, and practically
                    a miracle, saved the Bulgarian Jews from the fate of the rest of the Jews in
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about your father's business?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: According to the new Nazi law - The Law for the Defense of the Nation-
                    Jews were not allowed to own rural property, own or manage a commercial firm, so
                    on. And this is what happened to my father's business. It was taken over by his
                    Christian partner with no compensation whatsoever.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What type of government was there in Bulgaria then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: It was, of course, a monarchy with a pro-Nazi, Fascist government. I
                    don't really remember who the Prime Minister was at the time, but I know that he
                    was closely allied with the Nazis and followed their policies. A new law
                    required that all Jews register, declare all their properties and possessions,
                    and deposit all their money in blocked bank accounts. We were also made to take
                    Jewish names. For example, in my case, I was known as Bili Mosheva but had to
                    delete the “va” and become Bili Moshe. This law also prohibited Jews from
                    voting, holding public office, employing non-Jewish domestic help, a curfew
                    between the hours of 9 p.m. and 6 a.m., and the most devastating of all, all
                    Jewish men between the ages of 20 to 40 were sent to army labor camps.</p>
                <p>The same fascist government also agreed to allow the Germans to use Bulgarian
                    railroads to deport Jews from Macedonia, Greece, and Yugoslavia. Dupnitza was on
                    a main railway from Macedonia and I will never forget the cries for help coming
                    from the box cars, always in the middle of the night. We knew they were being
                    sent to concentration camps, but we never imagined what was happening in the
                    camps.</p>
                <p>Apparently, Hitler was becoming very angry with the King for refusing to follow
                    with his policy on the “Jewish solution” and for resisting to send Bulgarian
                    forces into Greece. He wanted an urgent face-to-face meeting. The day after the
                    King returned from Germany, he fell ill and died a few days later of
                    undetermined causes. Rumors were that he had been poisoned. I remember watching
                    the train carrying the King's body for burial in the Rila Monastery passing
                    through Dupnitza. Thousands of people were lining the tracks, crying. Jews were
                    crying not only for their protector but also for the fate that will befall them
                    after his death.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember when that happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: I am not sure. I think in the summer of 1943.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>BRYANT: Things become worse for us. The Fascist government supported by the
                    King's brother, Cyril, could now freely deport the Sofia Jews to the provincial
                    towns where they had relatives so that they could stay with them and not disrupt
                    the housing market. We seemed to have quite a few relatives who lived in Sofia,
                    because our modest house became a home to about 30 relatives. A family occupied
                    every room in the house, including the living rooms and we all shared three
                    kitchens. Despite the horrible conditions, the lack of food, and the fear of the
                    future, I clearly remember the love and kindness that prevailed in the house,
                    especially towards us children. As it happened, the evacuation spared the Jews
                    from Sofia from the horrific bombing by the British, which caused a great deal
                    of damage and many casualties in the capital.</p>
                <p>But then, one beautiful summer day in Dupnitza, something terrible happened; I
                    remember being on our small balcony with my brother and cousins watching the
                    British planes pass over the town (not for the first time), “just like silver
                    birds.” We yelled at the top of our voices “Please come and save us, we love
                    you,” and then we saw tens of bombs coming down on Dupnitza. Houses, perhaps
                    quarter of a mile way, were hit, dust and smoke raised over the town and
                    screams, which I still remember with horror, were heard all over the town. The
                    bitter irony of it all was that about 40 Jews, living as we did in the same
                    house, were killed. We learned later that Dupnitza was not the actual target but
                    because their original target was impossible to hit, they decided to get rid of
                    the bombs over our town. After the bombing we all ran from our homes at the
                    first sound of the alarm. Dupnitza, being built in a deep valley between high
                    hills, had very few places to hide. One of them was the railway tunnel, which
                    was used as bomb shelter, but Jews were not allowed there. So we hid under trees
                    and bushes and hoped for the best.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were you following the war news in all this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>BRYANT: BBC transmitted every evening in Bulgarian. As soon as the broadcast
                    started, everyone gathered around the radio and even the little ones sat quietly
                    listening to the news, which if I remember correctly described the battles being
                    fought and later won by the allies. But, in 1942 Jews were ordered to deliver
                    all radio sets to the authorities as part of the “Law for the Defense of the
                    Nation.” We all knew that this was only the beginning and got information
                    wherever we could get it.And then, on March 8, 1943 rumors reached our community
                    that the government has agreed to the Germans' demands to deport Bulgarian Jews
                    to concentration camps in Germany. I remember well the terror and the
                    helplessness we all felt, even the children. And indeed on March 9th we were
                    ordered to “pack a small bag with personal belongings for each member of the
                    family, since you may be sent to different locations.” I remember that day so
                    well, but not as if it was happening to me, but as if I were watching a movie.
                    While my mother was packing each of us a small bag, tears rolling down her
                    cheeks, my father decided to swallow his pride and go and beg his Christian
                    partner to “please take my children away and hide them with friends in one of
                    the villages.” The reply was “I couldn't endanger my family by saving your
                    children. But you know I have always liked the silver candlesticks in your home.
                    You won't need them any longer. Could I have them?”... My father came home
                    heartbroken: this was his friend and his partner of 30 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: We gathered in the living room and decided to eat up all the food we had
                    “stashed away for bad times” while we had the opportunity. There was a lot of
                    hugging and crying and all sorts of advice, “in case anyone survives.” At 10
                    a.m. on March 10, which was my birthday, there was a knock on our door and we
                    were told that we were allowed to leave the house and that our deportation has
                    been postponed. I didn't remember that myself, but my parents told me that there
                    was another attempt to deport the Bulgarian Jews, but this time “a miracle”
                    happened. Trains were otherwise engaged in transporting soldiers and ammunition
                    to the front.</p>
                <p>By the way, not one Bulgarian Jew was sent to the death camps. There are a lot of
                    conflicting stories about Boris, but the fact remains that he had the courage to
                    stand up to Hitler and to refuse our deportation. I honestly think that without
                    King Boris and his supporters, the Bulgarian Jews would have been doomed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well now, there was this peculiar thing that Bulgaria
                        never declared war on the United States, I think. Wasn't that it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>BRYANT: Indeed, and it is even stranger that Bulgaria never declared war on the
                    Soviet UnionApparently, when the war broke out, Bulgaria wanted to keep its
                    neutrality, but Hitler didn't like that a bit and pressured King Boris to join
                    the pact between Japan, Italy, and Germany. The King refused, but when Germany
                    offered to return to Bulgaria territories lost during the First World War, he
                    agreed that his country would become only a passive ally to the Germans. But,
                    Bulgaria became an ally all the same.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a Bulgarian, how did you look upon the United
                        States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: As Bulgarian Jews we were praying for America and England to win the war
                    and save us. They were like gods to us; I remember it so well. I seem to have
                    known a lot about the United States, but I honestly don't know how.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Weren't there movies? This was a sort of common culture
                        throughouall of Europe. Gary Cooper and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Yes, you are right. We did go to movies at every opportunity. The good,
                    handsome American men in the movies symbolized for us decency and heroism.
                    Bulgarian Jews worshiped Roosevelt himself. So it was especially painful to me
                    to read his letters in the Holocaust Museum about the “low priority for the
                    United States on saving the European Jews.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the end of the war when the Soviet army came?
                        Did thaimpact on you all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Very much so. Bulgarians in general and the Jews in particular, received
                    the Soviet soldiers as Bulgaria's saviors. In fact, there were many Jewish
                    partisans that fought side by side with the Soviets. Later on, many of them
                    became Communist Party leaders.</p>
                <p>With time, the general situation in the country further deteriorated. Bulgaria
                    was always considered as “the fruit and vegetable garden of the Balkans.” But
                    just after a year of the Communist regime, there was no fruit or vegetables to
                    be had. The main reason was that everything was being sent to the Soviet Union.
                    Another reason was that the farmers of the newly established “collective farms”
                    were paid so poorly, that they had no incentive to produce more for the domestic
                    market.</p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>Politically, the worsening situation had a great impact on my own family as well.
                    The new government blamed “the rich” for exploiting the proletariat. The
                    authorities began getting involved in my father's business and looking for
                    reasons to intimidate him. Not long after that, his business was nationalized.
                    In school, children were indoctrinated into the Communist Youth Party and
                    encouraged to report on anyone who spoke against the regime, including family
                    members.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were how old? Let's see...'34, they came about '44.
                        Let's saabout 10.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: About 10. Old enough. And I was fascinated by communism and became a very
                    devoted little Pioneer girl. The communists gave me the opportunity to get
                    involved in writing and the theater. I was in seventh heaven and my parents were
                    horrified.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had a red kerchief and...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: I wore a uniform, too. I was asked to read poems and write speeches on
                    Stalin, Dimitrov, and the great promises of communism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did thing change at all around '48, when Yugoslavia
                        decided to break away? Did you feel any impact of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: I remember the many Yugoslav children coming to Bulgaria as youth
                    exchange. And then one day, they were no longer our “brothers and sisters.” But
                    there was no other impact that I remember.</p>
                <p>Life had become unbearable for my parents. They worried that my father could be
                    arrested at any time and that, God forbid, I might become a real communist. At
                    that point they started exploring the possibility of leaving Bulgaria. As a
                    first step, they arranged that my brother, then 15, leave Bulgaria for
                    Palestine, with a group of 40 Jewish boys and girls. They left Bulgaria via
                    Turkey and Syria. The trip took over two months because of all sorts of border
                    crossing difficulties.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a legal thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: It was legal, both leaving Bulgaria and entering Palestine,but I don't
                    know the details.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you a part of this group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: No, my brother was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was when, about '46, '47.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: In '46. It was before Israel's Independence. So he went. He was only 15
                    years old and the family missed him terribly. But we knew that his departure
                    would be the impetus for us all to join him in Palestine. When in May of 1948
                    Israel was declared independent, “shlichim” (emissaries) came to Bulgaria to
                    encourage Jews to immigrate to Israel. My parents and many of their friends from
                    Dupnitza decided to go. We had to leave everything behind - we only took what we
                    could carry. And I never went back to Bulgaria until 1997 when I visited there
                    with my husband and brother and his wife.</p>
                <p>We visited the house I grew up in in Dupnitza. We left Bulgaria in November '48
                    and, as I said, left everything behind. And now, 50 years later, there they
                    were: the same sofa, the same table and chairs, everything as we left it. The
                    communist family that had taken over the house continued to live there all these
                    years. It was so eerie.</p>
                <p>And so, all the Jews that were leaving for Israel gathered in the Central
                    Synagogue in Sofia, carrying our measly possessions. The Israeli emissaries had
                    arranged to take us by train to Rijeka and then on ships to Haifa.</p>
                <p>Q: That's interesting. How did you get to Rijeka? The reason I say this is that
                    around this time the Yugoslavs were going through this break with the Soviets,
                    and Rijeka, of course, being a Yugoslav port?</p>
                <p>BRYANT: The Yugoslavs were quite friendly to Israel and I am sure they were paid
                    handsomely to let us through. But let me tell you, it was certainly not a
                    pleasure trip. We “traveled” by train in cattle cars - about 50 people to a car
                    - from Sofia all the way to Rijeka. That's a long way, with no toilets, no water
                    - it was just horrible. And then from Rijeka we got on an old, beaten-up cargo
                    ship. We had to stay in the hold and sleep on the shelves that were meant for
                    cargo. It was really quite bad, but you know, one survives these things.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it like getting there? By that time you were a
                        younteenage girl. You were about 14 or so.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>BRYANT: That's right. The terrible thing was that I knew very little about Jewish
                    religion or Zionism. I also new very little about Israel. When we first arrived,
                    we were placed in a large British former campsite - the British had just left
                    Israel - for a few weeks until we knew what next. We were housed in a large
                    barrack with about 30 other families. We were given a little money for food. I
                    remember that for the first time in my life I was actually hungry.</p>
                <p>My brother had left the kibbutz and was able to get a job and a room for us in
                    Haifa and he suggested that we all move there. And so we did. My father came to
                    Israel with nothing except a few Turkish gold coins - I still have one as a
                    souvenir - but he had nothing else. At the age of 46 he had to start all over
                    again, without language, profession, or money. The only work available at that
                    time in Haifa was in the port as a stevedore. My father was a slight and slender
                    man, not strong enough for this sort of work. So he would come home without
                    having found work or earned any money. It was really very sad.</p>
                <p>The only thing that helped us survive these difficult times was the love and the
                    wonderful sense of humor my family had. My father loved his drink. When we lived
                    in Bulgaria, he used to make his own wine and slivovitz. In Israel, the village
                    of Zikhron Ya'aqov had a very large winery - even then they were making wines in
                    Israel. So one day my father finally got a job, from all places in the winery,
                    filling up bottles of wine; the perfect job for him and a wonderful joke for the
                    family. So he finally started making a little money. I remember well when he
                    first got his wages, he brought home fresh bread and cheese and I was the
                    happiest girl in Israel.</p>
                <p>Q: So here you are, prime material for learning about new countries. You've
                    already been a young Pioneer and you've learned the glories of the Soviet Union,
                    and you're a good student. You're ready to pick up the glories of Israel.</p>
                <p>BRYANT: And I did. Obviously, I did because at the end I had became an Israeli
                    army officer and later an Israeli diplomat. Yet somehow I always felt different.
                    Perhaps I was too tall to be an Israeli...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You are how tall?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Well, I'm 5'9” now. And I was almost as tall when I was 15. Too tall
                    compared to other girls that age. I was also too skinny. Israeli girls at the
                    time use to wear bloomers; you might have seen them in photographs. And of
                    course, being tall with skinny legs, I looked horrible in bloomers. Also I was
                    very shy, though shy is not the right description of me then and now. I was very
                    insecure. And so my father decided, since he had no money to send me to a proper
                    school, why not accept the suggestion of the immigration authorities to send me
                    to a kibbutz with a group of Bulgarian children my age. And that's what I did. I
                    was sent at the age of 14 to Ein Harod, which was one of the nicest old
                    kibbutzim in the valley of Yisrael, where I joined another 40 Bulgarian boys and
                    girls.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you speaking Ladino at this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: No, Bulgarian. I never learned Ladino.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you said you didn't know Hebrew. There was no Hebrew
                        oanything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: No, we didn't speak or understand Hebrew. We spoke Bulgariaamong us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You must have been somewhat isolated from most of the
                        Israelis.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Yes, because most of the people in Israel, and in the kibbutzim, had come
                    from Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union and spoke Yiddish, so we were Europeans
                    but did not speak Yiddish, which made us an oddity. In the kibbutz we lived in
                    wooden cottages, 10 children to a cottage. We worked in the morning in the
                    fields and we went to school in the afternoon where we were taught Hebrew,
                    Jewish history and all other subjects related both to Israel and to the world.
                    It actually was a very good curriculum under the circumstances. I remember
                    working in the vegetable gardens, the vineyards and the grapefruit groves and
                    most of the time enjoying it.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, the kibbutzim were coming out of, you might say, the socialist left
                    wing, not the religious side, so you weren't really picking up the religion.</p>
                <p>BRYANT: Unfortunately not. We were taught the Bible, but as part of history, not
                    religion. Great emphasis was put on Hebrew and Israel's recent history. The
                    “kibbutzniks” themselves were atheists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your brother, who had come before you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: When we arrived to Israel my brother was still in a kibbutz. He had
                    fought during the war in the Palmach-I don't know if you have heard of it-this
                    is the very small, select army of young men and women from Kibbutzim. He was all
                    of 16 when he went to fight. He left the kibbutz and found a job in Haifa to
                    help my parents settle down. Having left the kibbutz with no profession fit for
                    the city, my brother found work with the railroads. He became an engineer for
                    the Israel's new railroads. This was very hard and dirty work, but he did that
                    for a while and helped the family a great deal.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By this time you were what, around 16?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: 16.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the kibbutz society?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Very, very nice. Some of my best memories of Israel were from the
                    kibbutz. And I'm talking about a different era in the kibbutz. At the time I was
                    in Ein Harod, people in the kibbutz worked very hard to sustain themselves and
                    help youth groups such as ours. They worked in the fields during the day and in
                    the evenings, after dinner in the communal dining room, we all gathered to read
                    poetry, discuss the current situation in the country and the world and most
                    importantly play the accordion and dance folk dances. It was such a beautiful,
                    beautiful existence. The kibbutz children did not live with their parents and we
                    all worked together. I think the existence of the kibbutz at that time was
                    really why Israel actually exists today.</p>
                <p>Q: Well it was really coming out of the European socialist experience. Sort of
                    the intellectuals put it together, and it was probably the only time it worked
                    anywhere.</p>
                <p>BRYANT: Right, and it really worked. It's amazing, because there were no
                    squabbles about “he got that and she got that,” and people actually liked each
                    other. I am very glad to have had this experience.</p>
                <p>I stayed in Ein Harod for two years and was quite happy there. But I missed my
                    family and had to move on. My parents and brother worked very hard to ensure
                    some sort of financial future and I knew I had to help; I needed to get a job
                    and I also needed to continue my education, and I was only 16.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>So when I returned to Haifa, I enrolled in high school where I also learned
                    accounting, typing and shorthand. Bear in mind we are talking about typing and
                    shorthand in Hebrew. I had just learned the language, but I needed to learn a
                    profession so that I could work during the day and go to school at night. And
                    indeed, I learned. And one day, I overheard the school director recommending
                    someone for a job and saying: “You'll be very happy with her. She is smart, hard
                    working and reliable.” I, of course, assumed he was recommending someone else. A
                    few minutes later I was called to the Director's office and introduced to a very
                    distinguished looking gentleman who was recruiting his first clerk for an
                    American-Israeli automotive plant that was being established in Haifa. The
                    American firm Kaiser-Fraser had just signed an agreement with an Israeli company
                    to assemble American cars in Israel. A lot had to be done administratively
                    before building the plant. The gentleman, Mr. Berman, needed somebody to work
                    for him, and here I was. He looked me over and he said, “Well, you look very
                    young, but you must be good since the director says you can do anything.” With
                    great trepidation I started working for this man. He was patient and kind and he
                    taught me a great deal. He really did and I shall forever be grateful to him. At
                    night after a long and stressful day in the office, I went to school.</p>
                <p>When the factory was completed, Mr. Berman and I moved to our new offices and
                    started recruiting other employees. By that time, I was considered a “senior
                    employee” at 16. I worked hard and climbed up the ladder to being the secretary
                    of the chairman. Kaiser-Ilin was very good to me and I learned there not only to
                    be a good secretary, but also to become more conscious of the world outside of
                    Israel.</p>
                <p>As you may know, at the age of 18 all Israelis are required by law to enlist in
                    the Army. So when I reached 18, I too had to enlist. After the 4-week basic
                    training, I was sent to a Military Intelligence Officers Course for six
                    exhausting months at the end of which I was assigned to the Mixed Armistice
                    Commission with Syria and Lebanon. As it happened, this was the beginning of my
                    diplomatic experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Mixed Armistice Commission in those days.
                        We'rtalking about 1950-ish, aren't we?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Well, '53 or '54. Representatives from the Israeli and Syrian or Lebanese
                    military would meet once a week to discuss border incidents; it could be as
                    minor as a donkey crossing the border, or something serious such as kidnaping
                    across the border or shooting at working farmers. Of course, United Nations
                    officers also participated. Eight to 10 people usually attended the meetings,
                    not more than that, depending on the seriousness of the incident. Not much was
                    happening on border with Lebanon, but there was always something going on with
                    the Syrians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of things were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>BRYANT: At that point the Syrians were sitting high up on the Golan Heights and
                    were shooting at Israeli farmers, or fishermen on the Kinneret (Lake Tiberias).
                    Both my superiors were high-ranking officers conducted the discussions. I was
                    only a second lieutenant and my job was to sit quietly and take notes of the
                    proceedings and then follow up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were these meeting at that time there with the
                        Syrians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: The meetings were very civilized. There was no social chatter and
                    exchange of jokes, but at the same time there was no hostility as such. I think
                    the hatred came later on when the Arabs started losing part of their
                    territories. The Syrians, as you know, lost the Golan Heights.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was thinking-there was the 1948 War; the next one was
                        '57, wait?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: '56.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the '56 war would be the Suez War?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: The Suez War. As soon as the war broke out, I, like thousands other
                    Israelis, was mobilized. I was assigned to the Public Affairs Office of the
                    Israeli Army, specifically, to escort foreign journalists who were reporting on
                    the war. A very interesting thing happened then; if you remember, the Israeli
                    army was moving very fast across the Negev. So there we were, riding across the
                    desert in a convoy of buses following the conquering army. At one point we lost
                    track of the army but were able to continue by following the hundreds of shoes
                    and boots left behind in the desert by the retreating Arab forces. Actually, I
                    found that to be a very sad sight. Finally we did get to Sharm el Sheikh.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which is the port on the Gulf of Aqaba.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Yes, but we got there before the Israeli tanks got there. I was
                    terrified, I must admit. Everything seemed eerily quiet. Apparently, the Arabs
                    had already left, so there was no danger to us, but let me tell you, I wouldn't
                    like to go through that experience again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you run into any Americans by this time or had any
                        feel foAmerica?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>BRYANT: During my stint in the Army I met, and in fact become friendly with two
                    U.S. Air Force officers. I was not a good judge of character at that time, but I
                    thought the colonel as very worldly and interesting. The major, on the other
                    hand, was charming but basic. He knew very little about the Middle East and what
                    was happening there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the Air Force, you know, of the services, didn't get
                        arounmuch in those days. They flew airplanes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: During that time, I met and worked briefly for General Moshe Dayan, who
                    was then the Northern Commander. He was dangerously flirtatious, but delightful.
                    He came often to our office on the shores of Lake Tiberias and would always
                    bring a flower and compliment me, and then concentrate on the “business” part of
                    his visit. I was really smitten by him: he was good looking, charming and
                    extremely intelligent. He just filled up the room when he walked in, he really
                    did.</p>
                <p>Later on I also met Chaim Herzog, who was at the time the Commander of Military
                    Intelligence and later, as you may know, became President of Israel. In Israel
                    after completion of your military service, you remain in semi-active duty and
                    can be called back at any time of need. I was well known in military circles as
                    a good and efficient worker. So whenever the intelligence service needed help,
                    they would call me, “Bilha, we need you here,” and off I'd go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were back at Kaiser?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Yes. I would serve in the reserves for a few weeks at a time and mostly
                    enjoy the challenge and the change, but it got to the point that I could not
                    afford it; after a while Kaiser-Ilin stopped paying my full salary and the Army
                    was certainly not paying much. This is when I actually met Chaim Herzog, worked
                    for him and we became very good friends.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had things changed at all after the '56 war?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: No, they hadn't. Perhaps at first the glory of victory helped morale in
                    the country, but it also brought a new and horrific factor to everyday life -
                    terrorism. While I haven't lived there for over 35 years, I still remember well
                    the horrors of terrorism for the ordinary Israeli. I still get upset at the
                    thought that the Arabs lost the Suez war fair and square and that the only way
                    they could stand up to Israel was by killing and maiming innocent people,
                    including small children.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now Bilha, what was your father doing in this time now?
                        Did hbegin to sort of make his way in Israel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Both my parents were working very hard. They had rented a small shop in
                    downtown Haifa where they sold fruit and vegetables and also served sandwiches,
                    coffee, tea and cold drinks to adjoining offices. My brother and I realized how
                    hard it was for them to be doing that; they did not speak Hebrew and they felt
                    degraded doing that sort of work. Both my brother and I spend any free time
                    helping them in the shop.</p>
                <p>We all lived together in a house we shared with a nice Arab family: they had the
                    first floor and we lived on half of the second floor sharing it with a Polish
                    religious couple. We were a closely-knit family so that even when I was in
                    Tiberias, I made an effort to come home as often as possible.</p>
                <p>Despite the difficult times, we somehow managed to remain happy. There was a lot
                    of laughter and joy in our small apartment in Haifa. And then one night, while
                    my brother and I were out to the theater, my father was taken to the hospital.
                    It was late at night, the buses were not running and we had no money for taxi.
                    Instead, we ran the three miles to the hospital and learned that my father had
                    had a severe heart attack, but that he had survived. After his return from the
                    hospital he had another attack and died at home. He was relatively young man; he
                    was only in his 50s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, very difficult.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Can you imagine, at the age of 45, you leave behind everything you have
                    worked for all your life and start again with nothing? We could and did overcome
                    poverty, but my father's early death was devastating to us. It was especially
                    traumatic for my mother, who at the age of 44, and under such difficult
                    circumstances became a widow.</p>
                <p>And here is where the Bulgarian influence showed its face: While my father was
                    alive, my brother and his new wife and baby lived in my parents' apartment. But
                    as soon as my father died, the situation was reversed and mother and I found
                    ourselves living in my brother's apartment... This is how things work in this
                    part of the world; women use to have very few rights. My brother is a wonderful
                    loving man and he took the responsibility kindly. My mother did not remarry and
                    continued to live with my brother's family in Israel until her death. But, to my
                    delight, after my marriage to Ted she also spent a few happy years with us in
                    many overseas posts. She was a wonderful company for our three daughters and
                    great European influence on their upbringing. She is dead now.</p>
                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>Q: How did you find, as a young woman, sort of moving up and in the upper
                    circles, in a way, through talent, Israel? I've heard it's very lively
                    society-lots of debating, very vibrant political life. Did you get involved in
                    that at all?</p>
                <p>BRYANT: Very much so. As I said earlier, I never felt as if I belonged in Israel.
                    Yet I knew that since I had to continue to live there, I had to do the best I
                    can with what I had. And so I did. I had an interesting group of friends in the
                    theater, and in the arts. I traveled often to Zfat, an old city in the north of
                    Israel, which had become an artists' colony. I knew a number of the artists and
                    had a great deal of fun with them. Between a full time job, and night school,
                    there was very little time left for socializing. I knew that something had to go
                    and that it could not be my job, so I gave up my college education. I have
                    always regretted the decision... In the meantime, through hard work and
                    determination, my job in Kaiser-Ilin had become more demanding, requiring travel
                    and long days and nights in the office; In fact, it had become a very exciting
                    job and I thrived on it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Well, I was the assistant to the Chairman of the company, which involved
                    preparing administratively everything he needed or might need to perform his
                    job. I handled all his Hebrew correspondence, attended his meetings and took
                    down the minutes-really, everything. I also traveled with him on business
                    trips.</p>
                <p>By the way, while working at Kaiser-Ilin I met Eleanor Roosevelt during her visit
                    to Israel, and to our factory, and in fact, have a photograph of myself
                    presenting her with bouquet of flowers. I also had the opportunity to meet many
                    American businessmen, including Soapy Williams, who later became Assistant
                    Secretary of State for African Affairs, and found them very friendly.</p>
                <p>Q: I would think in those times everything was so loose and people coming in and
                    all that degrees did not have the quite same meaning that they would have in a
                    more stable time when there's sort of a track. I mean, you had people like
                    yourself, I mean, coming in and sort of moving ahead without these formal
                    degrees - and frankly, a lot of time was wasted.</p>
                <p>BRYANT: It's true, you know. I never thought about it that way. One of the things
                    I regret very much is that I never got a degree, but here I was, a young woman
                    from another world really making it in Israel.</p>
                <pb facs="0017" n="Page0017"/>
                <p>One day while at work, I received a telephone call from one of the top officials
                    in the Israeli Foreign Ministry who had known me when I was with the Mixed
                    Armistice Commission. He told me that the Ministry had a number of positions in
                    the Foreign Service; would I like to join the Service. The first thing I thought
                    was: “how could I join? I don't even have a degree.” But they didn't even ask me
                    about that. They had known my work. I discussed the offer with my family who
                    encouraged me to go ahead and see how I like it. The exams and training took
                    place in Jerusalem, and lo and behold, six months later, I was offered a choice
                    of two posts; one in Johannesburg as a vice-consul and the other in The Hague as
                    a cultural attach�, which sounded a little more interesting for me. Besides,
                    South Africa seemed so far away. And so I accepted the one in Holland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you describe the Israeli Foreign Service in those
                        days? We're talking about what, '57, no, 1960?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: I joined in 1959 and arrived to The Hague in January of 1960. The Career
                    Israeli Foreign Ministry had been established not too long before. It was a very
                    small selective group of people mostly from academia and the military. They were
                    well educated, many of them in England or the United States, they spoke
                    languages, were involved and enthusiastic and very smart. The whole of the
                    European division at that time had a staff of about 15, perhaps less. In The
                    Hague embassy, there was the Ambassador, a distinguished Dutch Jew who had lived
                    in Holland before the war. He spoke many languages, but his Hebrew left much to
                    be desired. There was the DCM [deputy chief of mission], an economic counselor,
                    political officer and myself, and that was it. That was the embassy in Holland.
                    And there were so many official visits! When we were in Holland, Ben Gurion came
                    for a visit. You can imagine an American embassy during a President's visit.
                    Here we were, four people; and here he is, Ben Gurion with a large entourage and
                    a lot of demands. The Dutch at that time loved Israel, which made my job so
                    easy. It was not hard to convince the journalists to write good things about
                    Israel. They were so fascinated by the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a lot of Dutch young people going to Israel
                        to thkibbutzim?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Many young Dutch Jews would go to Israel but only for about six months or
                    so. We found the Jews of Holland, the ones that survived the Holocaust, very
                    much like the rest of the Dutch people; honest, decent and always very helpful
                    to the embassy, with money and any other way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from 1960-</hi>
                </p>

                <p>BRYANT: 1960 to 1963. And I remember so well how I met my future husband. My
                    husband Ted Bryant had been a vice-consul in Haifa and lived about three blocks
                    away from where I lived. But since I am younger, I never met him socially in
                    Haifa. On hearing that was being posted to The Hague, a friend in Kaiser-Ilin
                    who used to see him socially in Haifa, suggested that I look up Ted Bryant who
                    was then at the American Embassy in Holland and say “Hi.” He could introduce you
                    to young people there. But when I got to Holland I was really overwhelmed. I was
                    worried and scared and excited all at the same time. I was really alone for the
                    first time in my life, and I was too nervous to call him, so I never did. And
                    one day, my ambassador, whose wife was not very social, invited me to accompany
                    him to the “Yakharche Day” celebration. (Flag Day in Dutch). The celebration
                    took place on fishing boats going out for the first herring. Many diplomats are
                    invited and, according to the Ambassador, it usually is great fun. I of course
                    accepted. It was a cold, rough day, and the seas were high, and the wind was
                    blowing hard and yet I found the outing very exciting. I met quite a few
                    friendly and fascinating people. Among them was a lovely Mexican girl who was
                    also a diplomat, and several good looking Australians. And then I met a
                    beautiful Dutch baroness, who was very kind to introduce me to her “man,” Ted
                    Bryant. And so we started talking. And I asked, “Were you in Israel?” And he
                    said, yes, he was and oh, how pleased he was to meet me and, of course, “we must
                    get together.” And that was the last I heard from Ted Bryant. Weeks later, my
                    ambassador asked me again to go with him to the annual dance at the Club du
                    Jeudi dance since his wife could not go. This invitation was much more difficult
                    for me to accept since I was very poor and couldn't afford to buy an evening
                    dress. I was making very little money, but I did buy a dress. I don't think I
                    ate for about for two weeks. And when we got there, there was a Paul Jones
                    dance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. This is where you hold hands and sort of snake
                        througand then at a certain point-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Yes, and when you stop the man who stands across from you would be your
                    partner until the music stops. The first man who was across from me was a small
                    dark man, and, you know, I was young and quite attractive. And so he sort of put
                    his arms around me and started dancing, and said, “From where are your beautiful
                    eyes?” And I said, “From Haifa.” And I could feel his hands loosening. Well,
                    apparently, he was the Egyptian Ambassador. When the music stopped next, my
                    partner was a gentleman with one arm, who was the German attach�. And you know
                    the war was still fresh in my mind, so I wasn't happy. I thought to myself,
                    “such a waste of a dress!” Here I was dancing with an Egyptian and a German. My
                    third partner was a good looking clean cut man who promptly started speaking
                    French to me, saying: “Oh, je suis Belge.” And so we started talking, and he
                    asked me where I was from. When I said Haifa his eyes lit up and he remembered
                    me. And we re-met, and that was the beginning of our romance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So '60-'63 was the only time you were in the Israeli
                        ForeigService.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>BRYANT: Yes, and I remember an Israeli assistant secretary of the Foreign Service
                    saying to me when I announced my resignation: “We don't need women in the
                    Foreign Service. If they're attractive, they get married in two or three years.
                    And if they're not attractive, they stay there and become mean and frustrated.”
                    He was horrible.</p>
                <p>Q: Well, now we're in a much more equal situation, but there really was a problem
                    in foreign services all over. Up until very recently, when a woman officer got
                    married, often to a foreigner, more or less, she was expected to do resign, so
                    it meant that your investment was sort of down the tube. So I mean, it was not
                    just a prejudicial thing; there was a practicality: do you hire somebody who was
                    not going to hang around very long?</p>
                <p>Well, these interviews are sort of focused on your time dealing with foreign
                    affairs, but I think we might as well, because later on we're going to talk
                    about your time in the Department of State, talk about your time as a Foreign
                    Service wife. When did you get married?</p>
                <p>BRYANT: That's another interesting part of my life. We got engaged in February of
                    1963, but Ted wrote to say that he could not marry me without prior approval
                    from the State Department. He asked that I make an appointment with the
                    Political Counselor at the American Embassy in Tel Aviv, who by the way was an
                    old colleague of Ted's. I was quite nervous about the whole procedure; for one
                    thing I had been in the Military Intelligence Service, as well as in the Israeli
                    Foreign Service. Nobody believed I was actually a diplomat but thought I was in
                    the Shin Beth (the Israeli FBI), which I really wasn't. After my very pleasant
                    interview with the Political Counselor, I had to meet with the Consular Officer,
                    who looked me over carefully and asked a lot of questions. I had the distinct
                    feeling that he was judging my manners. And then, of course, the security
                    clearance took a while. Finally in May '63 Ted got permission to marry me and in
                    June of 1963 I arrived to the States. We were married in St. Thomas Church in
                    Washington, DC on June 29.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened then? Where was your and Ted's first
                        assignment?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Ted was in African Affairs. Now bear in mind that this was 1963, Kennedy
                    was President and Africa was very prominent in American politics. Soapy Williams
                    was assistant secretary of state for African Affairs. FSOs and wives were asked
                    to attend by-weekly get-togethers with African Embassies' staff where Soapy
                    Williams called and we all danced square dances. We had wonderfully close
                    relations with Ted's colleagues. In fact, people we met in African Affairs are
                    still our very dear friends, like Tony Ross. I loved it, I really did. According
                    to regulations, I had to remain in the U.S. for three years to qualify for an
                    overseas posting as a diplomat's wife.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: -and be an American citizen-</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>BRYANT: And I became an American citizen. During these three years in Washington
                    we had two daughters. So I was sort of busy. Even so, I was very involved in
                    Ted's life; enjoyed his friends and colleagues and made new friends. And then
                    our first posting was Mozambique.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And that was Portuguese.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Portuguese East Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: From 67 to 69.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And what was Ted doing there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>BRYANT: He was the deputy principal officer. That was probably one of the worst
                    experiences I have had in my life. Not as a post. Mozambique was a beautiful
                    place. Louren�o Marques was lovely, just lovely. But both the consul general and
                    his wife were from Oklahoma and they didn't know what to make of me, they really
                    didn't. Perhaps my foreign accent sounded suspicious to them. I was friendly,
                    happy, and I entertained beautifully, and they definitely didn't like me or
                    trust me. I have a very interesting story to tell about that. We did not have
                    super markets in Louren�o Marques where we could buy food for parties and things
                    like that. A few of us wives would get together and make the three-hour trip to
                    Nieuwspraat in South Africa, just on the border and either we would drive
                    ourselves or have a consulate car take us. This particular trip was for the
                    Fourth of July party at the Consulate General's residence. We took an office car
                    and driver and went to do the shopping for the party, including a number of
                    turkeys from the local butcher. When we came back, they dropped us off and took
                    all the turkeyabout six or seven of theto the consul general's residence. About
                    9 o'clock that evening, the telephone rang. The administrative officer was
                    calling to tell me that a turkey was missing and to ask me if I had taken it.
                    When I said that I had not, he insisted: “Bilha, you must have taken the turkey.
                    The Consul General asked that we come and check in your house.” I said, “You can
                    come and check,” but I was in tears, I can tell you. They came and of course,
                    they didn't find the turkey. But the next day they did find out that in fact two
                    turkeys were left behind because the butcher had forgotten them in the freezer.
                    And that was that, no apologies. So you can see this incident did not make me
                    happy and not very confident about my future in the U.S. Foreign Service. The
                    Consul General must have been intelligent, but you couldn't' tell. Perhaps being
                    in charge for the first time in his life did something to him. He had a dog, and
                    we all had to go once a week and play with the dog. And whenever they
                    entertained, and some of us attended their dinners, one of our duties was to
                    entertain the dog for 10 to 15 minutes. I mean during a dinner party; people
                    were talking and you had to throw this stupid ball to the dog. It was incredible
                    how they got away with such behavior.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You wonder how people can do it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: But they do. And every time he left the Post, he gave written
                    instructions to the administrative officer and all of us about our “dog's
                    duties: “Bill will come at eight o'clock in the morning and give him some
                    grapes; June will come at ten and give him his biscuit,” etc. It was really,
                    very difficult to respect a man like that. Mozambique was a very delightful
                    place to live, and all the Portuguese and Africans we met there were very, nice
                    people. It's too bad that relations in the Consulate General were not
                    happier.</p>
                <p>Q: Did you have much contact with what one would today call the “natives.” It's a
                    pejorative term, but you had the Portuguese who were settled there, and those
                    who were of African ancestry, who were basically sort of kept apart, weren't
                    they?</p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>BRYANT: The truth is that we did not meet Mozambican Africans socially. I
                    remember a famous African artist, -I don't remember his name-who was very
                    popular with the European diplomatic community. He was one of the few Africans
                    we could invite, so we all fought over him. We did know well and socialized with
                    the “native” Portuguese, mostly government officials, and businessmen. I
                    remember vividly the visit to Mozambique of Sam Westerfield, a deputy assistant
                    secretary for African Affairs, who was a good friend from our stint in
                    Washington. Sam was black and was especially interested in meeting Africans. So
                    we had a party for him and of course invited our one and only African, the
                    artist. When Sam Westerfield walked into our house, our wonderful “houseboy”
                    Ricardo opened the door for him, and Sam shook his hand and introduced himself.
                    Then he walked into our kitchen and shook hands with the rest of the staff. They
                    stood there quite taken aback, and told me, “Madam, it's not acceptable to us
                    for somebody to come and shake our hands while we are working.”</p>
                <p>There were quite a few black shop attendants. Where else did we sethem? -tailors
                    and shoemakers, people like that.</p>
                <p>They seemed happy, at least in Louren�o Marques. We didn't feel that they were
                    badly treated, because the Portuguese really accept color, much more than any
                    other European nation. What they lacked is the possibility of a good education.
                    The Portuguese made a big mistake in their policies with the Africans.
                    Mozambique could have been a prosperous and happier country for the Portuguese
                    remaining there, had they provided an education for the Africans. But otherwise
                    we did not see much poverty.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any revolt going on out in the hinterlands?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Yes, at that time already the revolt had started, but Louren�o Marques
                    itself was not affected. You could not tell. We heard about things happening out
                    there. In fact, we traveled a great deal, but we were never worried. I loved the
                    Mozambique Africans; they are happy, gregarious, friendly and smart people. They
                    were my favorite Africans, and I've known quite a few Africans. By the way, when
                    Mozambique became independent at least one of the people who worked for us
                    became a government official.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '69 you went where?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>BRYANT: By that time we all spoke Portuguese, so as a natural progression we were
                    told that our next assignment would be S�o Paolo and that Ted was going to be
                    Consul General there. At that time we still had only two little girls, and they
                    both spoke Portuguese since they went to a Portuguese nursery school. I started
                    telling the girls about Brazil and about S�o Paolo. I was very excited myself
                    since I had uncles and cousins there who had left Bulgaria for Brazil. We left
                    Mozambique and took our home leave with my husband's family in Rockport,
                    Massachusetts. The basic mistake was leaving our telephone number with the
                    Department because few days into our home leave Ted was informed that the Consul
                    General had decided to extend for a year so would we like to go to a place
                    called Ethiopia? And at that time you didn't really have much choice in the
                    Foreign Service except hang around Washington. So in September of '69, we
                    arrived in Addis Ababa. But our household effects went to Sao Paolo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was Addis Ababa. You were '69 to when there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: '69 to '72.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was life like in Ethiopia at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Fascinating. It was the most exciting place I've ever been. Addis Ababa
                    was not a city; it was a combination of small villages with dirt roads between
                    them, with cows and sheep on the roads and with people dressed in beautiful
                    white-I forget what they call those-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: -like togas-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Like togas. And it was just like living back in the 15th or 16th century.
                    The Ethiopians are very nice, and their women beautiful, with big eyes and
                    lovely smiles. When the Emperor left the palace on the way to his office,
                    usually twice a day, everybody on the road would bow, including diplomats-well,
                    not I. There were quite a few Italians in Addis Ababa, mostly industrialists.
                    The Armenian community was quite large; they ran most of the super markets in
                    town, as well as being the official jewelers to the court. We did get to know
                    socially some of the Ethiopian princes and princesses, and were very close
                    friends with a number of the ministers. I know it doesn't sound like it, but we
                    all enjoyed Ethiopia very much. Ted traveled extensively, climbed mountains, and
                    I was busy with the American Women's Club where I was in charge of publishing
                    the yearly diary. I was also busy having another baby, so for me, it was a
                    little more difficult to travel.</p>

                <p>BRYANT: In Ethiopia there was quite a large presence of Israelis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: -because there were close ties with that country.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the Israelis treat you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: The Israelis treated me all right, but the Americans were not too happy
                    about my being friendly with them. It appeared that our ambassador-Ambassador
                    Hall-was upset after Ted and I attended a dinner at the Israeli Ambassador's
                    residence. Instead of telling Ted or me, he mentioned his unhappiness about it
                    to somebody else, who in turn mentioned it to someone else, when it finally
                    reached us as nasty gossip. The Ambassador should have realized that I no longer
                    considered myself an Israeli; the fact was that I married an American, not an
                    Israeli and to top it all, I married a non-Jew. I was happy to dedicate my time
                    to the US Embassy and did and we had three children who were not being brought
                    up Jewish. I had friendly relations with the Israeli Embassy in the same way I
                    was friendly with the Greek Embassy or any other embassy in Addis. So because of
                    the Ambassador's feelings, I didn't see the Israelis after that any more. In
                    fact, it was sad because the Israeli Ambassador to Ethiopia at that time was a
                    former naval officer whom I knew from my days in the United Nations Mixed
                    Armistice Commission. In general we were very happy in Ethiopia.</p>
                <p>We came to Ethiopia after difficult time in Mozambique. Instead of going to
                    Brazil, we ended up in Ethiopia. Ted was assigned to be the chief commercial
                    officer there, and was supposed to have the former commercial officer's house.
                    Well, lo and behold, we got there and we moved into the house, but a few weeks
                    later we were told to move out because an AID officer outranked my husband and
                    wanted the house. So, with both girls, off we went to our new house, far away
                    from the embassy and the school, across the street from the AGIP gasoline depot,
                    and next door to the slaughterhouse! In fact, our address was #2 Slaughterhouse
                    Road! Not only that, but the girls had to cross train tracks to get to the main
                    road where the school bus picked them up! And here we were, all by ourselves,
                    away from the American community (there was a military attach� who lived next
                    door to us) because the man from AID outranked my husband by six months or
                    something like that. It demoralizes one, it really does. We are not only talking
                    about Ted; we are talking about the whole family. I mean, here we are, just
                    having taught the children that we are not in Brazil. “Mommy, is this Brazil?”
                    “No, darling, this is Ethiopia.” And “Mommy, is this our home?” “No, darling,
                    no, we have to move again.” So it was difficult.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>Life in the embassy was friendly and pleasant. We made good friends there that we
                    still see today. But I do remember the unreasonable duties the wives were given
                    by the Ambassador's or the DCM wives (or any wife that outranked us); after
                    large embassy parties, we would be asked to stay and count the silver. You see,
                    in Ethiopia, and especially at the Ambassador's residence, there was a large
                    staff. You would think this would be something they could do. We ourselves had a
                    staff of four. And here we were made to stay on and count silver! And another
                    thing: if you talked to any of your friends for more than a minute, some embassy
                    official would come around and say, “Circulate, circulate.”</p>
                <p>All wives were also expected to be involved in the American Women's club and all
                    its activities. I worked on the yearly “Ethiopian Diary” which we published and
                    sold to local companies and merchants, and I must say, I liked it. There was
                    also an International Women's Club, where the Ethiopian princesses and
                    diplomats' wives from other embassies got together to do good deeds for the
                    local schools, orphanages, etc.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: The first two years the Ambassador was Bill Hall. He was a career
                    ambassador. I think he was the inspector general before he came to Addis. I
                    don't think he felt very well while he was in Addis - the altitude or something.
                    His wife was an old Foreign Service wife, very determined, very serious, very
                    demanding, really - but not unpleasant.</p>
                <p>But you know, you look back on these things and can't believe some of it. I had
                    two little girls and I was expecting our third. While we entertained a great
                    deal, because we knew a lot of people, I didn't expect anybody in Ted's section
                    to provide food for our parties. On the other hand, when the Ambassador and the
                    DCM entertained at large parties, we were expected to bring dishes.</p>
                <p>This is, by the way, where we met and got to know George and Barbara Bush. Bush
                    was the ambassador to the United Nations at the time. The UN sat for a session
                    in Addis Ababa in 1972 and he came for the session. We had met them both in
                    Mozambique at a small dinner party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feel for unhappiness with the Emperor at
                        thatime? He was getting on in years by this time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>BRYANT: No, we all thought that this man was truly admired by his subjects. On
                    the other hand, his son, the Crown Prince, was not popular at all, perhaps
                    because he was not often exposed to the public and had not been given the chance
                    to prove otherwise. What we worried about was that when he died, his son would
                    take over and this could bring unrest in the country. We were so amazed at what
                    finally happened in Ethiopia. He had ruled Ethiopia well for most of the 40
                    years. He was an old man who didn't know how to change with the times, and
                    unfortunately his advisors did not serve him well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well he was essentially ruling from 1913-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: -through 1970. So it's 60 years.</p>
                <p>Q: So we're talking about 60 years. He was regent, and he went through a couple
                    of permutations, but essentially he was ruling from 1913 on.</p>
                <p>BRYANT: And he loved his people, and he actually thought, really-we met the
                    emperor and we knew a lot of his advisors-he actually thought he was doing good
                    things for his people. They had built a wonderful university, very active and
                    very well run. One didn't feel that people were unhappy, one really didn't'; but
                    of course, they must have been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, some may have been. It depends on leadership. It was

                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Very, very unhappy. And you know, people who visited Ethiopia just at
                    that time told us that the university had been closed, people in the government
                    murdered or arrested and in general a great deal of misery.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: In '72 we went to Karachi, Pakistan.</p>

                <p>BRYANT: '72 to '75. Karachi was to me like Ouagadougou.In fact, Ouagadougou was
                    more familiar for me because Ted was in African Affairs. Karachi sounded like a
                    horrible assignment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bilha, we're off to Karachi. You went to Karachi
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: We went to Karachi in September of '72.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Karachi like at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: On our way from the airport all we could see was rows of huts and poverty
                    all around us. The road leading to the center was wide and the traffic on it was
                    hundreds of rickshaws, bicycles animals and lots and lots of people-quite
                    terrifying, really. The intent of the wide road leading to the center was to
                    make the city of Karachi appear modern, but they were not quite there yet. But
                    when we arrived downtown to the residential area, the whole impression changed.
                    It was as if the British had never left; big, beautiful houses, with lush
                    gardens and flowers everywhere, beautiful clean streets -it was as if we had
                    stepped into another world. Our own house was gorgeous large house, with
                    beautiful gardens and a large staff to help run it. To think that Karachi
                    sounded so horrible and we dreaded going there and yet it turned out to be one
                    of our best postings in the Service-the Pakistanis were very, friendly and
                    generous people which made life very pleasant, but most important were the
                    wonderful colleagues, wives and even children the Consulate General was blessed
                    with: from the wonderful Consul General, Gordon Tiger, to the marines who became
                    our friends and guardians.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there from '72 to what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: '75.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were relations during that time? Did anything come to
                        sorof intrude on this idyllic life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: At that time, we were tilting toward Pakistan. We had an AID mission, and
                    we were very helpful to them. So nothing actually happened to ruin that sort of
                    idyllic relationship with the Pakistanis. It was hard to see the poverty around
                    us and we tried to help the people around us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned you had a houseful of servants. How the
                        devil doeone deal with that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>BRYANT: It's really easy. I found it easy; we all knew that I needed them at
                    least as much as they needed us. Though they fought among themselves once in a
                    while. It was much easier to deal with them since they were all Muslim and knew
                    well the hierarchy. They knew that the bearer would be the main person, and they
                    should take orders from him, rather than from me. So all I had to do was tell
                    the head bearer what I wanted done-how many people were coming for dinner and
                    when. Then I would talk to the cook and decide on the menu. All I had to do for
                    the party is be entertaining and make sure the guests were happy.</p>
                <p>Social life in Karachi was very busy and I must say some of it great fun. But at
                    that time we had a small baby Alexi and 2 little girls, Penny and Debbie, who
                    needed care. So we had a nanny for the day and a nanny for the night, with whom
                    I communicated constantly. But the rest of the staff, such the chaukidar
                    (guard), the dhobi (laundryman and the gardener, I left for the head
                    bearer).</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time, did you run across the Bhuttos?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Yes, but mostly his wife, Nasreen. I think-simply because we knew their
                    Pakistani friends and were invited to their houses, we used to meet them often.
                    The Pakistanis we knew drank a great deal, but they tried to hide that they were
                    drinking alcohol. The women would drink coke all evening, but as the party
                    progressed they would get happier and happier. So one evening I decided to ask
                    how could anybody be that social for such long hours drinking only coke? And so
                    I was told what's in the coke, either rum, gin, or whisky.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Not socially. But I remember something very interesting and very ironic-
                    Bhutto used to bring his own drinks to parties-not ours, but to other Pakistani
                    parties. He actually brought his own drinks and even water for fear of being
                    poisoned. It was very ironic how he died because he was so worried about-</p>

                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Yes. At the time we were actually visiting from New Delhi and having
                    dinner with Pakistani friends, among them politicians and ex-military people.
                    When the radio announced that Bhutto was hanged, there were loud gasps from
                    everyone around the table. Nobody expected that this would actually be done.</p>

                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>BRYANT: They did not like Indians at all. They really did not trust them as far
                    as they could throw them. That was then, in 1972. When we were in India, at
                    least they had started to talk to each other, but at that time, the relations
                    were really strained. The Pakistanis felt that the Americans were right to be
                    giving them as much aid as we did, since Pakistan was the most westernized and
                    easiest country to deal with in the area; while the Indians, they said, were
                    difficult and inward looking. The civil war in Afghanistan was going on and many
                    Afghani refugees had moved to Peshawar and needed assistance. And if I remember
                    correctly, the Americans were there to help.</p>

                    Indi— I'm confusing the times. We traveled a great deal around Pakistan. We went

                        Pakistan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Yes, and we had a very large mission which included AID, Library of
                    Congress, etc. 250 people worked in the Consulate General, including the local
                    employees. The mission actually had quite a great deal of autonomy, perhaps
                    because of the distance from the Embassy. Though the capital was moved to
                    Islamabad, Karachi remained a very important city, where heads of industries and
                    banks lived. Now I remember something that really brought economic havoc to the
                    country. The Bhutto Government announced the nationalization of all private
                    banks and private industry. It was hard enough for the bureaucracy to run the
                    county, imagine the disaster when they tried to run the banks and
                    industries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Islamic fundamentalism much of a force when you
                        werthere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: No, not in Karachi in any case. When we were in Peshawar one saw most
                    women wearing “burqas” (face and body covering). If I may generalize, most
                    wealthy women, certainly in the large cities, wore Pakistani shalvar-kameez
                    (pants with long-tail shirts) or beautiful saris but never western clothes. The
                    poorer the women were the more hidden behind the veils they seem to be. Per
                    example, our bearer, whose family lived on the premises, had both his wife and
                    daughter behind burqas. Mind you, his daughter was only 12 year old. Most of our
                    servants stopped everything as the “muezzin” called and went to pray, but I
                    honestly don't recall any of our Pakistani friends praying, and we were close
                    friends. Everyone however observed the month of Ramadan.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left there in '75. Where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Since we hadn't been home for a long time, we requested a home
                    assignment. In August '75 we went back to Washington, we got our tenants out of
                    the house. We found proper schools for the girls; we fixed the house, which was
                    in bad repair after years under tenants. The nine months we spent in the States
                    were difficult but we managed to achieve what we needed to and were looking
                    forward to a few quiet years in Washington. And then, Ted came home from the
                    office and announced that we have been posted to Seoul, Korea.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to Korea. We were there together. You were in
                        Korea from when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: We arrived to Korea in September of '75.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you like Korea?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: I did not like Korea very much. I had been living in a gentle society -
                    even Africa was a gentle society. Women were gentle, men were polite and
                    pleasant, and our staff at home was always willing and pleasant. And we came to
                    society that was so very different in every way.</p>
                <p>We also had an unfortunate thing happened: Ted came to Seoul to be the Commercial
                    counselor, but when we arrived there he was told that his “predecessor” had
                    decided to extend for two more years and instead he will be running the U.S.
                    Trade Center. Ted is not an outgoing man; he is more of a thinking man. So he
                    was very unhappy with the assignment. But moreover, it started all over
                    again-which house do we get since his job description had changed? Somebody had
                    a little higher grade, or he had been in grade longer than Ted-and here it was:
                    d�j� vu al over. After long deliberations, we were placed in an old
                    three-bedroom house with narrow wooden staircase leading to the bedrooms. I
                    worried that our 4 year old would fall down the stairs and hurt herself. Later
                    on we were moved to a nice house. So even if I were inclined to like Seoul
                    because of the different culture, this attitude by the powers to be managed to
                    sour me on the whole country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And nobody would call the Koreans a “gentle” people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: No, you certainly couldn't. I honestly think that the influence of the
                    U.S. Army on the Koreans did not help much in their attitude. Also the English
                    they learned from the Army left much to be desired. I remember sitting next to a
                    prominent Korean businessman at a dinner party, who kept repeating after
                    everything I said “No sweat, Mrs. Bryant.”</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>Since the economy in Korea was improving at the time we were there, we had
                    practically to beg colleagues who had servants to help us find some. As you
                    remember, social life was quite hectic and we did have three young children, so
                    naturally I needed help. I also must admit that I was a bit spoiled after
                    serving in Africa and the sub-continent. You remember the servant situation in
                    Korea. Even when you finally got someone, they definitely worked on their
                    terms.</p>
                <p>Our two older girls went to the school on the base, which was not a very good
                    school. Alexi, on the hand, went to a wonderful Montessori school where half the
                    children were Korean and the rest foreigners. There were 26 children in whole.
                    The foreigners paid the tuition for both theirs and the Korean children. This
                    was a wonderful experience for Alexi and she really loved it. She also learned
                    to speak Korean and was very helpful when we shopped in the Korean markets
                    positive.</p>
                <p>I am not being fair to include all Koreans in my criticism. We did meet and made
                    friends with some very interesting Koreans. We also liked our colleagues in the
                    Embassy and saw them socially. The country sights were magnificent and we
                    managed to see quite a bit of the country.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, you went back to India.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Then Ted got a telephone call from personnel that an FSO who was assigned
                    as a commercial counselor in New Delhi did not get a medical clearance and that
                    the Embassy needed someone urgently. Would Ted like that assignment. My gosh, we
                    had been nine months in Washington, we had just settled down in Korea after ten
                    months and things were looking up. Moving again with three children was just
                    horrific. It really was. But I knew Ted was unhappy with his job. We talked it
                    over and decided that Ted should accept. So we packed yet again and went to
                    India.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in New Delhi from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: We got to New Delhi in-let's see- June of '77 to June '81.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find New Delhi at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Most people could not believe that we actually loved Karachi and were
                    even more amazed that we wanted to go back to this part of the world. The fact
                    was that Karachi had a wonderful school for the girls, we had really good
                    friends both in the ConGen, especially our Consul General and wife Gordon and
                    Marian Tiger, and among the “natives,” we had a wonderful house and we were just
                    happy in Karachi.</p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>So I thought of New Delhi in similar terms. When we arrived to New Delhi during
                    monsoon, we had a house designated for us and ready for occupancy. And we liked
                    the house and the vast garden. The house was actually an old English bungalow,
                    quite large with intricate arrangement of rooms, but charming and comfortable.
                    We actually settled down quite quickly and though the weather was horrendous, we
                    were looking forward to our life there. We'd been there a week or so when one
                    morning the cook called me to ask for something. As we finished discussing the
                    menu for a dinner party in the foyer, since the kitchen was away from the house,
                    and we both left, the whole ceiling of the foyer caved in. I am not
                    exaggerating. Another minute and it could have killed us both. And for the next
                    week I couldn't stop crying. And you know I'm a big, strong woman and I don't
                    cry easily. I was so upset. Mind you, before we got into the house, we were
                    given temporary quarters for three weeks so that they could fix our permanent
                    house. This must have been the straw that broke the camel's back: having had to
                    move three times in two years and then that happens. I must have had a mild
                    nervous breakdown. Monsoon time in New Delhi is difficult as it is: you look out
                    of your air conditioned house at the beautiful green gardens expecting to go out
                    into the fresh air, but instead you go our into 120 heat with 99 humidity.</p>
                <p>The embassy in New Delhi was quite large as was the city and the embassy
                    community was dispersed. Perhaps this was the reason that nobody offered to help
                    us, even to show us where the most essential places are.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Ambassador Goheen, who was in a way an old Indian hand,because his
                    parents had been missionaries in India.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was from Princeton?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Yes. He was actually the youngest president of PrincetoUniversity. Both
                    the Ambassador and Mrs. Goheen were very nice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering whether that set the tone?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>BRYANT: Very possibly. Normally somebody at the top says, “Well now, look, we
                    want to make sure that newcomers are shown around and helped to settle down.” If
                    no volunteers were available, then make it part of embassy regulations. Archer
                    Blood was DCM, and I think at this point he was not very happy with his career.
                    This again colored the whole atmosphere in the embassy. Once a month Archer
                    Blood gave a reception for all newcomers. If you were to miss his reception, you
                    would have to wait for a month for the next group to arrive. New Delhi was a
                    large city with a large embassy, and you were expected to make your own way,
                    which thanks to having lived before in the sub-continent, we happily did. The
                    ambassador was not very social as well; he was an intellectual and not the life
                    of a party. Since Indian hosts usually served dinner not before 10 p.m., the
                    ambassador accepted few dinner invitations. Indians are extremely hospitable,
                    especially when it comes to important Americans and other foreigners and they
                    cared deeply that we attend their lavish dinners. My Indian friends would often
                    ask me to try and convince the ambassador to accept an invitation promising to
                    serve dinner by 9 p.m. I also remember during dinners at the residence, when
                    Ambassador Goheen would whisper to me, “Bilha, try to get them out of here by
                    ten.” But Indians never even arrive until about 10 or later. So socially it
                    wasn't working very well in the embassy. And politically was not much easier: we
                    were still tilting toward Pakistan and the Indians resented it openly. The first
                    thing an Indian will ask me at cocktail parties “How are you, Mrs. Bryant? I
                    understand you have lived in Karachi. How does that compare with New Delhi? You
                    like India better, don't you?” Of course, in my case, I did not like India
                    better; Karachi was friendly, comfortable and life much easier for us. I must
                    admit though that we found India to be one of the most fascinating countries we
                    have ever lived in, much more interesting than Pakistan. In India, wherever you
                    turned, whatever you looked at was history, culture, civilization and even
                    beauty. Since Ted was commercial counselor for all of India, we were able to
                    travel a great deal all over the country. I can't tell you how much we enjoyed
                    this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the Indians? I'm talking
                        about thclass that you were dealing with, I guess the political class.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>BRYANT: Well, Indians are intelligent, quick and smart. They are hospitable and
                    friendly, but they are definitely opinionated and quite defensive. As soon as we
                    arrived to India, we met a great number of Indian businessmen and
                    industrialists. They appeared open and easy to talk to provided the subject was
                    agreeable to them. But anything that may be construed as criticism towards
                    India, even complaining about the monsoon, is taken as an insult to the country.
                    I mean, we were very careful when we talked about India's economy or the
                    political system. What I did find, however, was that the women in India were
                    well educated, independent, ambitious, career-oriented and free to pursue their
                    interest. It was certainly not so with Pakistani Muslim women of the same class.
                    Those women were doctors and professors and teachers. They were fascinating to
                    meet socially. But here again the conversation had to be on their term. When we
                    happened to talk about the hard life of Indian women in the villages and I would
                    ask, “Why do you have so many children? I mean, after all, there are now ways
                    to-” the answer was “Oh, but India is such a rich country. There is a lot of
                    food for everybody.” Well, of course there was a lot of food for people who
                    lived in certain sections of New Delhi. There was very little food in the poor
                    suburbs of New Delhi and in the villages across India. There was very little
                    room in their small huts for them and their many children. Movies that you see
                    about India are actually very accurate. But Indians will never, never admit
                    there are poor people in India. “We are taking good care of ourselves.” Then
                    they bring up the subject of American Blacks and the “terrible” treatment they
                    receive here. In the late '70s and early '80s -maybe things have changed since
                    then-most conversations were controversial, unless we talked about the beautiful
                    saris, wonderful Indian food and of course the music. They have many things to
                    be proud of, but their arrogance overshadows their achievements. It's
                    interesting to compare them with Indians in the United States who contribute to
                    American life in so many ways, from science to food without much fuss. But this
                    is only my humble opinion made while living there for four years and getting to
                    know the people very well. After all, we were out, and I don't exaggerate, every
                    night of the week. We would first go to a cocktail party and then arrive at the
                    dinner party by 9-9:30 still being some of the first guests. Dinner will not be
                    served until midnight.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How does one manage with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Not very well, really. I managed by trying to have a nap every day, but
                    poor Ted! It was really very difficult on him because the next morning he had to
                    get up early and go to the office by 8. That's why a lot of our American
                    colleagues drew the line there. They said, “That's all, if they don't serve
                    dinner by 9, we leave.” I see pictures of us in India. I tell you we looked very
                    tired, extremely tired. In addition, the weather in India is enervating. There
                    is a very short period of the year when it's really comfortable; by February;
                    New Delhi is already very hot. We had 12 air conditioners in our house, so if
                    the electricity was going we were fine. Beautiful gardens surrounded the house.
                    Because of the water we all had stomach problems quite often in India. You tried
                    to be careful and always drink bottled water, but then the waiters would put a
                    piece of ice in your glass, and that's it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After this assignment, in '81, what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Well, as many of our colleagues, we parted sadly from the Department of
                    State. Ted had been assigned as commercial counselor to Brasilia, but again, at
                    the last moment, the commercial counselor in Brasilia decided to extend for two
                    more years. Ted learned about this while attending an economic conference in
                    Malaysia and since we had friends there, I decided to join him. In any case,
                    whatever happened during his negotiations with personnel, Ted decided to resign
                    on the spot. Usually, Ted and I discussed all problems and decisions concerning
                    the family. But this time he didn't consult with me at all and I was very, very
                    upset about his decision. We had three young children in grade school and I was
                    still a young woman and not ready for retirement. Ted himself wasn't very old
                    either; he was 55. Instead, without thinking twice, he just resigned. He thought
                    that he would leave the Foreign Service, and with his economic background be
                    able to find a job outside the Service that he would enjoy.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, that was a very hard time for the economy and jobs were scarce.
                    And the worst thing-and this may be interesting for some people to know-was when
                    we found out that while in Korea Ted my had stopped paying our part for health
                    benefits. I don't want to make my husband sound stupid, because he is not. He is
                    rather vague. And nobody in India-in the administration there that had his
                    records-nobody warned him that he was retiring without health benefits, since
                    you have to pay 5 consecutive years into the system before you retire to be able
                    to get the health benefits. They could have suggested that he stay for another
                    year in the Department and then leave with proper benefits. Nobody told him. My
                    husband retired in India-he didn't even retire in the United States-and we came
                    back, and I said, “Oh, we have to organize our health, and all those things.
                    What are we going to do?” And he said, “Oh, we don't have health coverage.” I
                    said, “What!” He said, “Oh, Bilha, we can afford it; we have enough money to pay
                    for our coverage.” I was beside myself. We had three children and my mother
                    living with us, and he was saying, we can pay for ourselves! You see, the
                    trouble was that I didn't know much about these things; I was just a wife. So
                    instead of yelling and screaming I decided to take matters into my own hands and
                    went to talk to the appropriate person in the State Department to see whether
                    something could be done. The answer was that nothing could be done because this
                    is the law.</p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>So a thought struck me that I may be able to get a job with State and I just
                    walked into the Office of Personnel in European Affairs and asked for a job.
                    “What can you do,” they asked. I said, “Well, I was a Foreign Service officer.
                    I'm really quite capable. I can do something.” And they said, “Can you type?”
                    and I said, “Yes.” (though I actually didn't type too well). Now here I am, the
                    wife of a Foreign Service officer, and until recently a “lady of leisure”, an
                    expert in moving and entertaining, accepting a job as a temp secretary/typist. I
                    asked if I could get a permanent job with benefits and the answer was: “Not
                    until positions open up.” In any case, to cut a long story short, I learned how
                    to type, and on the day of the test took a Valium and was able to type the
                    required 40 words a minute. The Soviet Bureau was desperate for clerical help
                    and I was sent there.</p>
                <p>Q: This would be in-: '82?</p>
                <p>BRYANT: And so I started working the following week, but I warned the Office
                    Director that since I have three relatively young children, I could only work
                    part time and he agreed. I didn't type very fast, but I was very conscientious
                    and hard working. I was willing to help anyone that needed help, and they let me
                    help; sometime it would be xeroxing or distributing papers, but more often than
                    not they would ask me to respond to letters or telephone calls seeking
                    information about the Soviet Union. I also learned to use the “Wang”. To the
                    relief of the busy officers, I started taking over some of their work. They were
                    so pleased that they wrote to Personnel asking that I'd be hired as a permanent
                    secretary to the Director, despite the fact that I didn't want to work more than
                    three or four days a week. And so I got a permanent job with health benefits
                    that covered all of us, and so we are fine. I worked in the State Department for
                    11 years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about the time that you were there, because
                        there waa progression, wasn't there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Yes, definitely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did this work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>BRYANT: Well, you know, I didn't realize that I was ambitious. I had forgotten my
                    earlier career and all that, because I was enjoying being a wife of a FSO and
                    bringing up children. But when I started working, the old ambitious Bilha
                    reappeared. I would look at the young Foreign Service officers, who were really
                    just beginning, and I'd think to myself, “I know I could do that.” My English
                    was quite good, especially my written English. And of course it was 1982, with
                    everything happening in the Soviet Office. Everyone was working long hours into
                    the night. The Jewish “refuseniks” immigration question was being raised often
                    by visiting U.S. dignitaries to then Soviet Union and lists had to be prepared
                    and letters to be written. I was given the job and did it for a couple of years.
                    As relations improved and we started having cultural exchanges with the Soviet
                    Union, I went to work for this section within the same office, and then I moved
                    on.</p>
                <p>Q: While you are dealing with Jewish immigration affairs, did the Israeli embassy
                    or any Jewish groups say, “Aha, we have a friend in court” and go after you?</p>
                <p>BRYANT: Having upset Ambassador Hall in Ethiopia because of my friendly relations
                    with Israeli diplomats, whom I had known before I became an American, I really
                    kept my distance from the Israelis in Washington, and that's the honest truth. I
                    did not know anybody in the Israeli Embassy and with the name of Bryant I don't
                    think they knew who I was.</p>
                <p>It was very ironic to see diplomacy in action: Both the U.S. and the Israeli
                    governments were arguing over every Soviet Jew, especially someone like
                    Sharansky and other Jews of his caliber. The Israelis wanted as many Soviet Jews
                    as possible to increase the European population in Israel and somehow culturally
                    balance things. Eventually Sharansky himself chose to go to Israel. The irony is
                    that Sharansky, whom they wanted so badly, has become ultra-conservative and is
                    now a thorn in any Labor government. He's no longer the liberal Russian; he is a
                    supporter of the Likud party and openly proclaims his hate and intolerance
                    toward the Arabs. So the Israelis really did not do very well by getting
                    Sharansky and his kind to Israel. So I did keep away from the Israeli embassy,
                    definitely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were working on the refuseniks, how
                        did wwork on that? What did we do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: We presented to the Soviet Government long lists of names of Soviet Jews
                    who wanted to emigrate. In fact, every time Secretary Shultz met with high-level
                    Soviet officials, he would insist that the Soviets find fifteen minutes time to
                    discuss the emigration of Soviet Jews. The Soviets would look through the lists
                    and let few refuseniks out. It had become a principal for the Soviets not to
                    succumb to our demands and to bargain about them. I actually felt that had we
                    not pushed as hard, more Soviets Jews might have left since they had become a
                    nuisance for the regime. The few that were able to leave were cared for by
                    Jewish organizations that helped them settle either here or in Israel.</p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>Q: Did you get any feeling that within the Soviet office there was concern that
                    we had other things to deal with besides immigration from the Soviet Union? And
                    usually these things are pretty quid-pro-quo, and so if you insist on one thing
                    you are expending negotiating capital.</p>
                <p>BRYANT: Well, I must say that there were indeed so many more important things
                    happening at that time that the political officers in the Soviet office could
                    not invest a lot of time in this and considered it more as a gesture toward the
                    American-Jewish community rather than an important policy issue. The political
                    officers themselves were very unhappy with the travel restrictions and such that
                    were imposed on Soviet diplomats in the States and especially their UN staff, as
                    a bargaining point for free emigration. The political officers in the bureau
                    were unhappy with the arrangement, since travel restrictions were imposed on our
                    diplomats in the Soviet Union as well. They also thought at the time there were
                    far more important issues between the two countries. So it was difficult. I
                    can't tell you how devoted and hardworking those officers were. They were at the
                    office all the time. It was hard on me also because I said I'd work three days a
                    week, and I found myself working almost every day and late hours and all that,
                    but it was an exciting experience because it allowed me do interesting jobs that
                    mattered. I learned so much about the Soviet Union.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were dealing with refuseniks from sort of when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: I think for about a year but I don't remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this was when Reagan was calling the Soviets the “evil
                        empire” and all this. It was a right-wing Republican administration. Did you
                        feel that where you were?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Very much so, except that I thought Shultz was a wonderful Secretary of
                    State. He was a moderate Republican. He was also a man who surrounded himself
                    and took advise from Foreign Service officers. He did listen and he did try to
                    influence Reagan. He didn't have much influence because wasn't Weinberger then
                    the Secretary of Defense?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: So that was a difficult period for sure. Weinberger was very close to the
                    President and had strong opinions on the Soviet Union. But people on the Soviet
                    Desk knew they had the support of the Secretary and found working for him very
                    rewarding. These officers had first class minds, deep knowledge of the Soviet
                    Union, many of whom had lived there and yet nobody ever guessed what was coming,
                    none of them. It was incredible.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you moved over. Where did you move to then after you
                        lefthe refuseniks?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Well it was the same office. Then I worked for the cultural exchange
                    people for less than a year. At this point there were so many Congressional
                    letters on the Soviet Union piling up on the officers' desks that I suggested to
                    the director, who was a good friend-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the director?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Jim Shumaker. Later Shumaker left to become Consul General in Leningrad.
                    Louis Sell replaced him. Louis asked if I would mind answering some of the
                    hundreds of congressional letters and I agreed. In any case, then I became the
                    congressional specialist for the Soviet Desk. I answered letters on the
                    Refuseniks, on food shortages and many more issues that I honestly don't
                    remember any more. It covered each and every political and economic issue we had
                    with the Soviets at that time. Of course, I would write the letters and then
                    clear them with the appropriate officers. I would write, type and pack the
                    letters according to the extreme bureaucratic demand of H. So I became a
                    specialist on Congressional letters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why would Congress be writing you letters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: In fact, constituents would write to their Senator or Congressman on a
                    variety of issues that concern them, including at the time issues on the Soviet
                    Union. They would write on behalf of constituents urging the emigration of
                    certain refuseniks, complaining about why are we helping the Soviets and
                    sometimes why are we not helping them and most often and most urgently concerns
                    about human rights in the Soviet Union. At this point I can't remember all the
                    issues, but I do remember that some of the letters about the human rights
                    situation were involved and complex, requiring detailed responses as to what is
                    the USA doing to alleviate the suffering, etc.-I mean, really, three or four
                    page letters. So here I became the Congressional specialist. By the way, every
                    summer I was able to take two month off and go to Massachusetts with the family.
                    Eager young interns who were interested in the Foreign Service would replace me.
                    One year, while the Director was a way, the Deputy told me that I could not take
                    my usual “summer vacation.” And I left the office. Of course, when I returned
                    they still hadn't find a replacement for me and wanted me back, but I didn't
                    agree. And I decided to go and work for H.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: H being Congressional Relations.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>BRYANT: Congressional Relations. And this was probably my worst experience in the
                    State Department. It was the Correspondence Division, and so 12 women, all GS-9
                    to 12, sat gossiping about each other and really hating each other-terrible. We
                    had prepared language for all the letters we wrote. That means that I will get a
                    pile of letters and instead of composing the responses I would fill out forms
                    that say: use paragraphs 1, 7, and 9 and pass them on to the secretaries for
                    typing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a mindless job.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Mindless. I mean, a secretary could do that. Why pay a GS-9 and 11s to do
                    that sort of work? Well, I could not stand the job and the atmosphere in the
                    office and decided to look out for something else. So one day while I was having
                    lunch with a friend, an officer, complaining about my horrible job he said,
                    “Hey, I have a job for you. Eastern Europe wants somebody like you. They are
                    overwhelmed with work. Why don't you come and meet the director?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This would be about when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: May of '85. And so I went to see the director of Easter European Affairs,
                    Jim Swihart, who was a nice, soft-spoken man. We talked for a while and he told
                    me that he really wants me to work for the office. When I told him of my
                    “working conditions, working 3 to 4 days and going to Rockport in the summer, he
                    said, “I don't care. When you come back, you start work here. Bilha, please
                    start work here.” And in September, I started. That was '85-or was it '86? I
                    think it was '86. The office dealt with Romania, Hungary, Poland,
                    Czechoslovakia, Bulgaria and Albania. Things were happening in all these
                    countries in varying degrees, and you could feel it in the air. Being Bulgarian
                    myself, everything about this part of the world seemed familiar. So I was very
                    happy. The Director and his deputy were both wonderful and set the tone for the
                    whole office. The officers were great. I had an interesting job. I had a title.
                    I got promoted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your basic job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: I was the public affairs officer. I really loved this job, and I worked
                    four days a week rather than three. I worked well with the officers and when
                    things started happening we were all extremely busy but honestly quite happy.
                    Then, you know, revolution in Poland with Walesa and in Romania with-what was
                    his name?-</p>

                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>BRYANT: Ceausescu. Even Bulgaria started moving out of thdarkness. It was the
                    most exciting time for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: I did that until I retired. I started in '86 in Eastern Europe and a lot
                    of changes happened while I was there, you know, new directors, new officers and
                    new countries, but I continued to be very happy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, you retired when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: I retired in December '94.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How well prepared did you find the place? We're really
                        talkinabout, all hell broke lose in '89, and particularly in Eastern
                        Europe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Nobody was prepared to what actually happened.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there any feeling there that this guy Gorbachev and the Soviet Union seem
                    to be heading off on a course that may loosen the ties with the Soviet Union
                    with these Eastern European countries?</p>
                <p>BRYANT: Nobody guessed until the fall of Ceausescu. No, Poland was before that.
                    Ceausescu was '89. Poland was '87 or '88 beginning with the strikes in Gdansk.
                    We were all very excited, not as much about Walesa-and you have to bear with me
                    because names have disappeared-but about the very intelligent very articulate
                    man that was his prime minister for a while. The Department was trying so much
                    to really support him, but the political system in Poland did not work quite as
                    we expected. Walesa and his people were the winners. Nobody expected things to
                    move as fast and we were all overwhelmed. The officers hardly went home; there
                    was so much to do. But looking on the positive side, we were all extremely happy
                    with the way the changes in Poland occurred. It was a peaceful revolution and it
                    became an example to the rest. Economic help followed immediately. We knew they
                    would know what to do with it.</p>
                <p>I remember working on the President's visit to Poland, which was very
                    interesting. I actually wrote a detailed scenario for the President. Not having
                    been to Warsaw, I was still able, with information from officers who have lived
                    there, to write in detail what Warsaw looked like, what stops the President will
                    make and where, etc.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any concern that when things started moving in
                        Polanthe Soviets might move in.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Yes, for the first few months, people were really considering what should
                    be done in case the Soviets decided to interfere. But Gorbachev not only did not
                    interfere, but also gave some leeway to their former satellites. As soon as this
                    happened, the Poles, the Czechoslovaks and the Hungarians took the ball and ran
                    with it. I must say, there was so much going on in all of Eastern Europe and all
                    at the same time that it's hard for me to remember details.</p>
                <p>Q: As sort of the press person, there is the State Department press spokesperson,
                    and what was the connection? I mean, these things were happening fast.</p>
                <p>BRYANT: I can tell you. First thing when we arrived to the office, would be the
                    press release. I will collect the information and draft the press release in
                    very short sentences. Then it will go to the desk officer in charge of the
                    country where it was happening. He'll make changes and give it back to me. I'll
                    make the changes and bring it to the deputy director. He would look at it. He
                    was a very relaxed, a great guy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Jim Hooper. Great guy. Then Jim would say, “Just take it over to Jim” or
                    whoever was in charge at the time. Jim would fuss with it a little, not too much
                    and then the press release would go up to the office of our Assistant Secretary
                    for European Affairs and at least 10 people would fuss with that there. I am
                    speaking of a press release of perhaps 10 lines or even less. And then it will
                    go to the Assistant Secretary himself. The document will end up on my desk after
                    every addition/correction. And so, by the time it got to the Press Office, there
                    was very little remaining from what I had written, except for the actual facts.
                    So that's what happened. And for all we knew, the Press Office might have
                    changed it also. Then we'll receive the final version, and we'll file it, and
                    the next day it will start all over again.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An awful lot of cooks on this particular soup.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: And they really worried about every word. “Oh, don't say that, because
                    that might look promising. Don't say that because that might sound
                    negative.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have Eastern Germany?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>BRYANT: No. But here is where I want to say something. It was so interesting to
                    see that certain racism shows it's claws everywhere. In this case it was between
                    being a “real European” or not. At that time everything was being done for
                    Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary. I know because I worked with the economic
                    assistance groups outside the Department of State and read all the constituents'
                    letters urging more and more assistance. And here were the poor southern
                    cousins, Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia and Albania completely neglected, I mean,
                    truly. After all, not too many constituents would be interested in these
                    countries. And being Bulgarian myself I especially felt it. Nothing, or
                    practically nothing was being done. It was very interesting to see the office of
                    Eastern European Affairs spiritually split in two. By the way, later as I
                    understand it, the office was actually divided to Northern and Southern Affairs,
                    because it got to the point where the officers of Southern Europe insisted that
                    something be done for the countries they represented. What else was very, very
                    interesting? I was going to mention it. I lost my thought.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Poland had been kind of out there somewhat different

                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Yes.</p>
                <p>Q: They had never quite gotten rid of the Catholic Church, and you know, things
                    had been happening. You actually had a labor movement. But then going to
                    Czechoslovakia, where, after the Prague Spring of 1968, I mean, this is a very
                    repressive regime.</p>
                <p>BRYANT: And in Hungary, where after...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, after '56...</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Yes, there was really blood on the streets.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any feeling that these places were going

                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>BRYANT: They caught everybody by surprise not because this was not expected, but
                    because of the speed things happened. In Czechoslovakia they called it the
                    “velvet revolution.” Vaclav Havel had been in contact with our embassy for some
                    time so he was a known quality. And the embassy had been reporting that things
                    would work well in Czechoslovakia. But Hungary-nobody was very positive about
                    Hungary, and as it happened they were right. During the country's first
                    elections, ex-Communists were elected as Prime Minister and President. It was
                    amazing how little we guessed and yet how well the officers were prepared, under
                    the circumstances. I mean, so much had happened and in such short time, and yet
                    these officers were able to handle the situation, and handle it quite
                    successfully.</p>
                <p>Q: Was there sort of a sense of running around and saying, “Omigod, something is
                    happening in Czechoslovakia. What can we do?” And running around, I mean, in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>BRYANT: Definitely. Plenty of running around, not knowing how to go about certain
                    things. Wisely in many cases they asked advice from Americans of Polish,
                    Hungarian and Czechs decent who were knowledgeable about these countries and who
                    got involved earnestly in improving conditions in their former homelands. With
                    all the different issues and diverse personalities involved, the situation
                    somehow never got chaotic. It was dealt efficiently and well, considering that
                    everyday something unexpected would happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about what was happening in Romania, the fall of
                        Ceausescu?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: The Romanian desk officer was a very good officer, but even he didn't
                    imagine what actually would happen. What people in the office expected was that
                    the new Romanian regime would let Ceausescu go to the Soviet Union, but in all
                    probability his people will be running the country. They would start slowly
                    toward democracy and eventually economic reforms. We really can't get credit for
                    what happened next in Romania. All credit goes to the starving miners who seized
                    the moment during their big strike. And here again it was a big surprise to our
                    officers. Except for Bulgaria, Romania was one of the most devoted Communist
                    countries in Eastern Europe and, in my humble opinion; we didn't handle Romania
                    very well and the reason was that we were not veryinterested in handling Romania
                    very well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Bulgaria was just not on the radar.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>BRYANT: Not even that. We did almost nothing for those poor brave Bulgarian
                    people, who were struggling to get rid of the Soviets and needed all the help
                    they could get. We just handled the situation very badly. The fact was that we
                    didn't need anything from Romania or Bulgaria. Bulgaria didn't have a large
                    community with influence in the States and most Romanians in the U.S. are
                    Gypsies. Only the Gypsies' Association was writing letters urging assistance to
                    Romania, which I found amusing. On the other hand we did have a huge Polish
                    community; In Chicago there are almost as many Poles as in Warsaw. The
                    Polish-Americans had a great influence and they knew it. They wanted things done
                    for Poland and demanded that things be done immediately. It was ironic, I
                    thought, that while they urged the government to help Poland, they wrote letters
                    to State demanding that the U.S. Government help them recover their nationalized
                    houses in Poland. And who would pay for that? The Polish Government, of
                    course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you are moving into this, the real thing in a way
                        shifteover rather quickly into Yugoslavia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Very quickly indeed. This job for me became the most important and
                    stressful work I have ever done. I remained the public affairs officer for
                    Eastern Europe, but really most of my work revolved around Yugoslavia. At that
                    point, the three central European countries were being reorganized into another
                    office. There was nothing happening in Bulgaria. Romania quieted down; except
                    for the Romanian orphans issue also took a lot of my time. Americans are kind
                    hearted and love children. And when they read in the papers about the tragic
                    situation, everybody wanted to adopt a Romanian orphan. But then when the
                    Romanian orphans started trickling into the U.S., the adoptive parents realized
                    how sick those kids were - many had AIDS also - there came the letters and the
                    pleas for help. This was a large and complex project I had to carry.</p>
                <p>When I finished with this project I moved to the Yugoslav desk. Then it all
                    started. I am not a great political scientist-but even I knew that we were
                    handling the problems of Yugoslavia badly. I remember writing letters for the
                    signature of President Bush, which showed in no uncertain terms the indecision
                    and flip-flopping of the administration on the issue. If we had put our foot
                    down there and then and shown Serbia our determination to prevent the conflict,
                    we would have saved 200,000 people who died for nothing and a lot more misery
                    for everyone in the country.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>BRYANT: What we kept saying was it's really none of our business since these
                    people had been fighting for something or another throughout history. This was
                    wrong. During the 50 or so years of Communist regime, the people of Yugoslavia
                    lived in peace, in the same neighborhoods or small villages. They intermarried
                    and had children, so it possible for them to live peacefully. And we kept
                    saying, and I remember I kept writing it over and over again, “The people of
                    Yugoslavia have fought for the last 500 years, and they fought over Kosovo, etc.
                    We do not want to get involved.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were the officers dealing with Yugoslavia on
                        this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: The officers who knew Yugoslavia wanted us to do something to prevent
                    what came next. Our ambassador in Belgrade, Warren Zimmerman, whom I liked very
                    much, wanted us to really slap the wrist of Milosevic. He wrote many letters to
                    Congress and other organizations giving examples of Milosevic's politics, and
                    urging the U.S. Government to do something about this man. He rightly predicted
                    that Milosevic would make havoc in Yugoslavia.” But nobody seemed to listen and
                    I don't honestly know why.</p>
                <p>I must say, I really had a great deal of admiration Deputy Secretary Eagleburger
                    who had served as a third secretary and an Ambassador to Yugoslavia and I've
                    written a lot of letters that he signed without much fuss or too many changes.
                    Yet, Eagleburger insisted that these people (the Yugoslavs) hate each other and
                    will kill each other at any opportunity. “We cannot and should not help.” The
                    Europeans were reluctant as well; worrying that all the refugees from the
                    conflict will end up in their countries. The charitable organizations were the
                    only ones who got involved, by providing food and shelter to the affected
                    population, but couldn't of course stop the fighting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you sense, as things developed, the siege of Sarajevo,
                        thmassacre at Srebrenica, and on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>How were these things hitting you?</p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>BRYANT: It had become a very difficult place to work. All of us on the Yugoslav
                    Desk were very, very unhappy that after all our hard work, we couldn't stop the
                    bloodshed. We were faced daily with reports describing in details the massacres
                    of innocent people that occurred in many places. I remember reading about 16 or
                    17 Bosnians who got on a train for Sarajevo and never arrived there. Later on
                    their bodies were found in a mass grave. We had to read the reports about the
                    terrible rapes and just horrible situations-a young Muslim woman in Sarajevo who
                    was raped by Serbs not being able to tell her parents about it not to bring
                    shame on the family. And with all of that going on, we sat there and wrote
                    platitudes. We are the most powerful nation in the world. If we had said to
                    Milosevic, “Stop it. If not, we will drop a bomb in the middle of Belgrade”-just
                    say it, don't do it. But we kept saying we would not get involved. Milosevic is
                    a bully, and we all knew he was a bully. You have to use different tactics with
                    a bully and yet we treated him like a normal man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There were several resignations, I think three men who
                        werworking there. Did that have any effect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Three young men. I was working very closely with them. That was very sad
                    because they were good officers and brilliant young men. One of them actually
                    worked for the Secretary before he came to the desk. I though they all had very,
                    good reasons to resign. I remember doing the press release and giving it for
                    clearance to one of the officers-they were working then on Sarajevo. He would
                    look at it carefully make some small changes and say: “Great, this sounds good.
                    It is strong.” I had become very ego-involved in the conflict and liked the
                    approval of my direct superiors. But then the press release might not even come
                    back to our office, but we would listen to the press conference and realize that
                    nothing was left of our original document. We were very upset, disappointed and
                    demoralized.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it coming from the State Department up above, or was
                        it thWhite House?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: I really think it was coming from the White House, but Stathad a lot to
                    do with it.</p>
                <p>Q: Tell me something. You were there. I got the impression-and please correct me
                    or explain it-but his spokesperson was Margaret Tutwiler, and I had the feeling
                    that Bush had a coterie about him, led by Margaret Tutwiler, who were mainly out
                    to make sure that Baker looked good for a future presidential run. And you know,
                    secretaries of state are the people who have to deal with bad news, and they had
                    better not start worrying about how they look and start worrying about policy.
                    Did you have that feeling?</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>BRYANT: I am afraid you are right. One of the things we kept hearing about our
                    possible involvement in Yugoslavia was, “We get involved, and when the first
                    Americans come back in bags, then we'll have hell to pay.” And Baker did not
                    want that; he wanted the pure image of an American patriot. And I am afraid the
                    public opinion was very much the same. Hundreds of people would call the desk
                    and ask that we do something for the people of Yugoslavia, but as soon as you
                    mention sending our military to help, the tone of support would change. “I hope
                    you're not going to send anybody to Yugoslavia to fight and die.” So it was not
                    an easy decision for the President and the Secretary to make. Maybe it's only
                    the way I felt, but the work continued to be hard and the morale was getting
                    lower and lower, and I thought, I don't want to be here any longer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Good time to go.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BRYANT: Yes, I didn't want to be there any longer. I have good memories and I was
                    wise to do this job and stay for as long as I did. I was even wiser to leave
                    when I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, why don't we stop at this point?</hi>
