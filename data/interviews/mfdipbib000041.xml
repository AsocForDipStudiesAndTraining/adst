                <p>UNDER SECRETARY GEORGE BALL</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Paige E. Mulhollan</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: July 8, 1971</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's begin by identifying you, sir. You're George Ball,
                        and during the Johnson Administration you served as under secretary [of
                        state] from the time Mr. Johnson took office until the summer of 1966.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Until the end of September of 1966.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Then you came back as ambassador to the United Nations for
                        a very short period.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: A period of four months beginning—I thought it was the beginning of June of
                    1968, but that wouldn't make it four months, would it? No, it wasn't four
                    months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was April, May, and June, wasn't it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Actually I was appointed in April, but because of the fact that Arthur
                    Goldberg, who was my predecessor, wanted to see something through—I've forgotten
                    what it was—I didn't actually take office, as I recall, till June.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How well did you know Mr. Johnson back in the days prior
                        to his vice presidency, when you were working for Governor Stevenson in his
                        campaigns of the fifties? Did you have any personal contact with Lyndon
                        Johnson then at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Very little. I knew him casually, not only because of my relationship with
                    Stevenson, but because as a lawyer in Washington I had had some very casual
                    relations with him. But I didn't know him well, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that include the 1960 convention when Mr. Johnson was
                        an outspoken candidate on his own, as well as Mr. Stevenson?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>BALL: Actually in 1960 I was at the convention. I didn't take any part in it. I
                    was simply there on the sidelines, holding Adlai's hand. It wasn't a very happy
                    affair, because none of us expected him to be nominated, but one had to see it
                    through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Mr. Johnson as vice president? You were in the
                        State Department throughout that period, first as under secretary for
                        economic affairs and later as under secretary.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: I had a certain amount of dealings with him, and they were all very
                    satisfactory, very pleasant. One got the very clear impression of a man who was
                    quite unhappy with his lot. Here was a-man who was an activist, who was used to
                    being at the center of power in the Senate, who suddenly found himself with
                    substantially no power whatsoever, working with a president who, for reasons
                    I've never been able to understand, treated him as apparently every president
                    treats his vice president: fails to include him in serious councils, rather
                    ignores his advice, and gives him the most menial tasks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does that mean that Mr. Johnson wasn't really very close
                        to any of the foreign policy decisions that you worked with while you were
                        working for Mr. Kennedy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: He was not at all close to them. He was actually involved in very few of
                    the decisions that were taken during that period, or in very little of the
                    discussion. Now, an exception to that was in October of 1962 when he came into
                    the meetings of the so-called Ex-Com during the Cuban Missile Crisis. Those
                    meetings were held in my conference room at the State Department. We had a kind
                    of continuous session that went on for that week while we were trying to decide
                    what action to take.</p>
                <p>He came into the meetings. He said relatively little. He didn't take a dominant
                    part at all in the discussions. The rest of us did to a much greater extent. He
                    was inclined to take quite a hard line, as I recall, but displaying at the same
                    time a kind of deference to the rest of the group, almost making it clear that
                    he recognized that he didn't have the background and experience, that he had not
                    been through this problem in as intimate a sense as most of the rest of us had
                    been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The stereotype of the man always concerned with domestic
                        things and not very knowledgeable about foreign affairs is fairly true then,
                        officially.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: That's fairly true. Then, of course, he went on certain missions. He went
                    on the mission to Berlin at the time of the Wall. But it was again in a kind of
                    public relations role rather than a substantive role.</p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From the department's point of view, how did he perform as
                        a public relations ambassador, either in the Berlin case or in his Vietnam
                        trip? Acceptably or unknowledgeably?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: He was very hard to work with, I think partly because of the insecurity of
                    his own position. It was much more difficult to work with him as vice president
                    than it was as president, much more demanding, less reasonable in these demands,
                    in my observation. After he had become president and was secure in his mastering
                    of the situation, I always found him relatively easy to work with, but he
                    certainly was not during his vice presidential period.</p>
                <p>There was one time when he complained very bitterly to me about some speech that
                    someone in the department had written for him. I rewrote his speech myself,
                    wrote him a letter of explanation, and he acknowledged it with a good deal of
                    grace, in effect, not exactly apologizing, but recognizing that the fault had
                    not been all on our side. But I can't say that even during that period I got to
                    know him extremely well, although he always treated me with a great deal of
                    warmth, and from time to time would give me what I suppose was the maximum
                    praise for Lyndon Johnson. [He'd say], “You're a can-do man. {Laughter}</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Specifically on the Vietnam issue, you signed I guess the
                        so-called critical telegram August 24, 1964 that is alleged to have led to
                        Diem's downfall. This was when I believe Kennedy and McNamara and Rusk were
                        out of town. Did Johnson get involved in that because they were gone?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: No, he didn't get involved with it at all. I'll tell you the situation. It
                    was during the period when Dean Rusk was at the General Assembly in New York. He
                    went up every year for a couple of weeks at the beginning of the General
                    Assembly because the foreign ministers and the heads of government from all over
                    the world were there, and it was a great opportunity to consult.</p>
                <p>McNamara was off on a holiday, as I recall. I believe I saw the President in the
                    morning, and then he went up to Hyannis Port. I think it was one of the four
                    times in the six years that I got to play golf. I think twice I did it with Rusk
                    and twice with Alex Johnson. Alex and I had gone out to play golf for a couple
                    of hours at the end of the day. I had been on the phone with Rusk all day.
                    Obviously I always left word as to where I was.</p>
                <p>Just as I was finishing up the ninth hole, or eighteenth, I think it was probably
                    only the ninth hole, we normally didn't have time for more than that—it was a
                    public golf course contrary to what was in the paper at the time, it was not
                    Chevy Chase, I don't belong to any golf club—Averell Harriman and [Roger]
                    Hilsman appeared in a great sweat. They had a telegram that they wanted me to
                    approve because I was acting secretary, [a telegram] that could be sent to
                    Saigon.</p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>So we went back to my house. I looked at the telegram; I recognized that this was
                    a telegram of considerable importance. I personally was not unsympathetic with
                    what it said because I had felt that we had really run our course with the Diem
                    regime. Unless he got rid of the Nhus and straightened up, II felt] that it was
                    impossible to go forward. If we were prepared to get out, that was one thing,
                    but I had found no sympathy with my general views that we ought to get out of
                    Vietnam. So if they were saying to the generals as this telegram did, saying to
                    Saigon, to the embassy, “Make one further effort with Diem, but you can tell the
                    generals that we're certainly not-encouraging a coup and we're not going to
                    assist a coup, but we will support any respectable, non-communist government
                    that is established, that existed.” It was perfectly clear that this could be
                    taken as encouragement and would indeed be taken as encouragement by the
                    generals.</p>
                <p>So I talked to Rusk in New York and gave him a rather [general briefing]. I don't
                    think I read him the text, although I probably read him the critical
                    paragraphs—we didn't have a secure line—and told him that I was going to call
                    the President and see what the President thought of it. Rusk said, “Well, go
                    ahead.”</p>
                <p>So I called Kennedy at Hyannis Port, and I went over the whole thing. He asked me
                    what I really thought. I had told him that Averell and Hilsman very much wanted
                    to do this. I had made some changes in the telegram; I had watered it down
                    myself actually over their earlier version. I read him the critical paragraphs.
                    I told him that this would certainly be taken as encouragement by the generals
                    to a coup. But I said I thought that, in my judgment, the situation with Diem
                    was becoming an enormous humiliation to the United States, that we were
                    supporting a regime which was behaving in the most unconscionable and cruel,
                    uncivilized way toward a significant minority of the population. Madame Nhu was
                    making the most outrageous statements, and Nhu was a very devious and unreliable
                    fellow. I thought to send this telegram to Lodge, who had just arrived there,
                    was probably all right. So he approved it</p>
                <p>He said, “Where's Bob?” I said, “He's away.” He said, “Get hold of Ros Gilpatric
                    and see that it's cleared with him.” So I left it with the Pentagon people to
                    prepare and get out. I notice the accounts now say that Ros says he cleared it
                    because he understood the President had cleared it. Well, that wasn't exactly
                    what the President did, and that wasn't the instructions I gave. The
                    instructions were that the President said that if it's agreeable to Gilpatric,
                    to go ahead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess [John] McCone was gone, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: McCone was gone, too, yes. Anyway, we went ahead.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Johnson was not involved in any of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>BALL: He wasn't involved in any of it. There's been a squib in the newspapers
                    that his book is going to say that this was just cleared by underlings, which
                    isn't the case. It was cleared by the President of the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Apparently he's supposed to have held this against
                        Hilsman, too. Is this what led to Hilsman's departure shortly after the
                        President took office?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: No. I fired Roger Hilsman, with the full approval of Mr. Rusk. He had
                    become very difficult. He was so full of his own omniscience with regard to
                    Vietnam, and he was lecturing the generals on strategy. He became rather a
                    nuisance. So we got rid of him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm glad to get that story on the tape because I suspected
                        that that was indeed the case. I'm glad to have you put it on there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: I can tell you another story, if we're going to put any time limit on this.
                    And that is that Dean Rusk once said to me later, “You fired Roger Hilsman, but
                    would you do a great favor for me? I said, “What's that?” He said, “Would you
                    let me say that I fired him?” {Laughter}</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The good things, the Secretary wants to take credit for
                        himself.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>It's strange in light of some of the revelations of the so-called Pentagon Papers
                    that apparently one of the things that Hilsman was very strong on was the covert
                    operations strategy, and that was being undertaken at just the time that he
                    left. Of course, he later said that he left because the President wasn't doing
                    what he wanted to do.</p>
                <p>BALL: Roger spent a great deal of time in his own self-justification, taking a
                    lot too seriously.</p>
                <p>Let me just add one thing on this, just to complete the record. I don't think
                    that this telegram was what precipitated the coup. Nothing happened after this
                    telegram. The generals decided they couldn't do anything about it. This
                    telegram, as I recall, was in August. The coup took place the first of November,
                    and that's quite a long time afterward. In the meantime a lot of things had been
                    done. President Kennedy himself on television had made some very tough remarks
                    about what Diem has to do to straighten up, and this could very well have been
                    taken as that kind of encouragement. In fact, we had already started putting the
                    squeeze on by withholding aid, so that I think we had established the causal
                    relation, one way or another. I think this was only one of a number of things,
                    and to put the total focus on this, I think, was a great mistake.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It may have been done by Hilsman putting it in his book so
                        prominently, as a matter of fact. After the assassination, I believe you
                        were one of those who accompanied the new President Johnson back from
                        Andrews [Air Force Base] on the helicopter that night. Can you describe
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: The situation that night, as you recall, the members of the cabinet were on
                    the plane that had taken off from Hickam Field en route to Japan for the annual
                    joint cabinet meeting with the Japanese and United States governments. I was
                    acting secretary of state. Bob McNamara was in the Pentagon. Mac Bundy was in
                    the White House. In fact, the whole rest of top level government was out of
                    town.</p>
                <p>So I telephoned Dean Rusk and told him that the President had been shot—on the
                    plane—and he said that they had just had word from one of the press services and
                    what was the situation. I told him all I knew. He said they were going to come
                    into Hickam Field and he would call me as soon as he got to Hickam. He called me
                    from Hickam Field, and I told him the President was dead. He said, “Where shall
                    we come to? Shall we come to Washington, or shall we come to Dallas?” I said,
                    “Come to Washington.” Of course, they weren't going to get in until much later
                    that night.</p>
                <p>In the meantime, I found myself suddenly with a great number of duties imposed
                    which I didn't ever think of as attached to the Office of the Secretary of
                    State. There are all kinds of statutory proclamations and actions that a
                    secretary of state has to take on the death of a president. It derives from the
                    fact that the Office of the Secretary of State as originally conceived was
                    really the Secretary of State; it wasn't the foreign minister. There was going
                    to be an associate foreign ministry. Then they put the two things together, but
                    there were still some residual obligations that were left over from the original
                    conception. So I was very busy drafting proclamations and doing all kinds of
                    things that afternoon.</p>
                <p>Then Bob McNamara, Mac [Bundy], and I went out to meet the new President. We met
                    him; we got in the helicopter with. President and Mrs. Johnson, and the five of
                    us rode back to the White House together. We talked a bit. The President, of
                    course, was enormously moved by the dreadful experiences he had been through. He
                    talked principally of how gallant Mrs. Kennedy had been, how she had insisted on
                    standing with him even though the blood was still on her stockings and dress and
                    so on.</p>
                <p>He assured each one of us that he was going to count on us, that we had to stand
                    by him, and that the government was going to go forward. [He said] that the one
                    thing that heartened him was the fact that he was surrounded with fine people
                    like us, the things that I suppose one would normally say.</p>
                <p>We got to the White House. We went in through the Cabinet Room. The President was
                    going to meet with the leadership. So I went back to the department, because I
                    still had a thousand things I had to finish that night. Then I went out later to
                    meet the cabinet when it came in.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was not a policy-discussion evening. That was just a
                        recovering-from-the-shock-type of conversation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>When did he finally get into starting to try to master the issues outstanding in
                    the area of foreign affairs? Right away?</p>
                <p>BALL: As I recall, when we got off the helicopter we stopped very briefly in the
                    Cabinet Room, and he said, “Now, what do I have to do right away? What are the
                    things that have to be done in the next forty-eight hours? Apart from the
                    funeral arrangements, what substantive problems are there?” I think I may have
                    mentioned two or three things that were on top of the agenda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lodge was in town, I think, wasn't he? Or just about to
                        come into town, or something of that nature?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Yes, he was. He had come back for some kind of briefing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the funeral itself and Mr. Johnson as a
                        personal diplomat with all the world leaders who came in? I know in the case
                        of De Gaulle it was rumored that this was the beginning of a sort of
                        breakdown of relationship between the two.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: I obviously had a great deal of conversation with the President about how
                    we organized this reception: whom he should see and whom he shouldn't see; the
                    fact that De Gaulle was coming over; what attention should he pay to him and
                    what attention should he pay to everybody else. We agreed that for the De Gaulle
                    visit that he would go into the Secretary of State's office, as I recall, since
                    the reception was on the eighth floor of the State Department. I'd asked the
                    General to come in. To the best of my recollection, when he met with the General
                    ! think I stayed in the room with them, but I'm not certain on that. I can't
                    really recall. There were so damned many things going on. If I didn't, Dean did,
                    and I don't know which one of us did, very frankly. We always operated on a kind
                    of interchangeable basis. He may have felt he had to stay with the other heads
                    of state.</p>
                <p>But it wasn't a substantive conversation of any significance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So far as you know, it didn't lead to any long-term
                        [consequences]?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>BALL: I don't think so. The General felt honored, I'm sure, to be given even this
                    brief meeting under the circumstances. I can't imagine anything serious came out
                    of it. But let me say that President Johnson was extremely awkward at that time
                    and ill at ease. This was just out of his experience, I mean not a part of his
                    experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he take your advice on who to see, for example, and
                        what to say, how to say it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Yes, by and large. He resisted at some points if we crowded people on him
                    he couldn't quite understand why we had to see then. No, I don't say that—he was
                    not [adverse to] the arrangements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During that first two or three months, as you watched the
                        new President sort of start settling down into the job he'd suddenly come
                        to, did he frequently display a shortness with the Kennedy men, a blow-up at
                        Kennedy men, an abuse of subordinates?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: I think he was doing his best to lean over backwards to make them feel a
                    part of the show. Certainly during that early period he gave every indication
                    that he wanted them to stay, that he certainly didn't want anyone leaving. He
                    wanted them to feel that they had a place with him.</p>
                <p>Now, when I say that was the attitude of the President, I'm not suggesting that
                    some of the people that he brought in didn't have fairly abrasive relations with
                    the Kennedy people because this was certainly true.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course they were replacing them, and they were. .</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: They were replacing them, and even if they weren't replacing them, they
                    were working alongside of them. And they were perfectly open in making clear
                    that they had better access to the President than the Kennedy people did. But I
                    think the President did his very best.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you in your now considered hindsight estimate
                        the situation in regard to Vietnam when the presidency changed? Was it such,
                        for example, that Mr. Johnson could have disengaged? Was that a time when a
                        basic change could have been made?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>BALL: There was always a time when a basic change could have been made. I never
                    subscribed myself to the belief that we were ever at a point where we couldn't
                    turn around. What concerned me then as it did much more intensely even later was
                    that the more forces we committed, the more men we committed to Vietnam, the
                    more grandiloquent our verbal encouragement of the South Vietnamese was, the
                    more costly was any disengagement.</p>
                <p>I think it would have been terribly difficult for him to have disengaged
                    immediately, because it would look as though he were repudiating the policy of
                    Kennedy. I think that this is something which would have been almost impossible
                    for him to do. At that time there was no particular opposition to the war
                    amongst the public. I think he would have been subject to all kinds of
                    attack—that the moment he gets in, he turns his back on the policy of President
                    Kennedy and gives something to the communists. I just don't think he could have
                    done it then, as far as the domestic political situation was concerned.</p>
                <p>But actually what he was most concerned with was not Vietnam at that point. While
                    Vietnam had begun to fill up more and more of the kind of screen through which
                    we view things, at that time it was just one of a lot of things that were
                    ongoing.</p>
                <p>I've got something—I don't particularly talk about it, but one of the very few
                    things I took away from the department was telecons of my conversations for six
                    years. I could tell you a lot more, actually, if I sat down and reviewed
                    them.</p>
                <p>But I got the impression that the President's instinct was to do what came
                    naturally to him. It's easy to forget now, but at that time it was almost a
                    constitutional crisis as far as President Kennedy's program was concerned. There
                    was a kind of constipation on Capitol Hill that was really very serious, and the
                    President turned immediately to the problem of how could he get the Kennedy
                    program through. I think he felt sort of a personal responsibility to Kennedy to
                    get his program through. I think he deeply felt this, and he did it superbly. He
                    did it much better than Kennedy could ever have done it. Whether Kennedy could
                    have done it at all, I'm not sure, because by that time he was very worried
                    about it. He was not getting along well with Congress at all.</p>
                <p>So this was what consumed an enormous lot of his [Johnson's] time. He was much
                    more intent on this than he was on the problems of Vietnam which were cranking
                    along. It was in the hands of exactly the same people who had been advising
                    Kennedy, and I think he was more or less inclined to let those of us who had
                    this responsibility continue with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've had people tell me that Vietnam didn't really engage
                        him probably until after the 1964 election. Of course, now we're being told
                        that all these decisions had occurred before then.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>BALL: That's absolute nonsense. They weren't decisions. What was happening was
                    that after he got the legislative program through, or even before, he became
                    immediately involved in the election campaign, the convention and the campaign.
                    The Tonkin Gulf occurred in the middle of that, in August.</p>
                <p>I remember at the end of September I had become so deeply concerned about the
                    situation in Vietnam that I sat down during the nights—because I couldn't do
                    this in the office and I couldn't use any staff—and dictated a memorandum which
                    turned out to be about seventy-five pages long.</p>
                <p>Q; Is this the one that got leaked to Joe Alsop ultimately?</p>
                <p>BALL: Yes. He never saw the memorandum. All that was ever leaked to Alsop was the
                    existence of the memorandum, the fact of its existence. This was a memorandum
                    that challenged every assumption of our Vietnam policy. And then the second
                    section was a kind of plan for disengaging. I don't have this with me. I've got
                    it, but I don't have it here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Will it be in the presidential library somewhere?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It did get to the White House, then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Yes, it got to the White House. What happened on that was that the
                    memorandum was written the last week of September. It took me about two weeks,
                    because, as I say, I'd get up at three or four in the morning—I had a dictating
                    machine in my house—and I would go into the library there and dictate through
                    the night.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's sometimes the best time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Yes. I had a very strong conviction that I should never treat with the
                    President on an ex parte basis. So I sent a copy of this to McNamara, and one to
                    Rusk, and one to Mac Bundy. I think there were only five copies made,
                    altogether. McNamara, in particular, was absolutely horrified. He treated it
                    like a poisonous snake. The idea that people would put these kinds of things
                    down on paper!</p>
                <p>We met then for two Saturday afternoons to discuss this thing. As I say, the
                    general attitude of the conferrees was to treat it as something that really
                    shouldn't have been done. Although I think that Rusk and Bundy were more
                    tolerant of my effort to put it on paper than Bob was. He really just regarded
                    it as next to treason, that this had been put down on paper.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was anybody else saying such things at that? Anybody in a

                </p>
                <p>BALL: No. None of them. Not at all.</p>
                <p>In some way the fact that I had written the memorandum challenging the
                    assumptions of our Vietnam policy did get to Alsop. I have a theory that Mike
                    Forrestal knew something about it. Whether this is true or not, I don't know. It
                    would be unjust to leave that accusation in that form, because Mike said he had
                    not done so.</p>
                <p>Anyway, Alsop had a column in which he said that I had written a memorandum
                    challenging our policy in Vietnam and that while I knew something about Europe,
                    my knowledge of Asia one could put in a thimble. So I wrote Alsop and said,
                    “Dear Joe, You are quite wrong in your state-merit that my knowledge of Asia
                    could be put in a thimble. It could be put in a soup plate. By this, I mean it's
                    much broader than you suggest and also more shallow.” (Laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which he probably accepted at face value.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: The President was very upset that this thing appeared.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the column, you mean? Not with the memorandum?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Not with the memorandum, which he had not then seen. I didn't press to show
                    it to the President, because he was occupied with the campaign at that time. But
                    about the first of January, after the election, Bill Moyers was over for lunch
                    with me one day, and I gave this to Bill. He read it, and he says that this was
                    the beginning of his conversion on the Vietnamese issue. So then I said, “Well,
                    if you feel that this is something serious, I had intended it for the President,
                    and I want to give it to the President.” Which he did.</p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>And the President read it not once, but twice, so he told me, and he was very
                    impressed, or shaken, by it. So he insisted that we sit down and start
                    arguments. Well, that was the beginning of a process I then employed, because
                    then I wrote the President every few weeks setting forth, in effect, what I
                    thought were quite serious reasoned memoranda which were difficult to do
                    because, as I say, I had to do them all myself. But each one was addressed at
                    some particular proposal for escalation, challenging the proposal and arguing
                    that we were losing the war, that it was an unwinnable war, that the whole
                    objective was an unattainable objective, that we could commit any number
                    of—500,000 I think was the figure I used at one point in a memorandum—and that
                    we still would not win. All the reasons I've set forth. And each time I ended
                    up, “Therefore we should cut our losses,” that this would be the consequence in
                    short-term problems, but in long-term we would gain by it, which I set forth in
                    relation to each country: countries in the Far East, countries in Europe, the
                    neutralist countries, and so on.</p>
                <p>The President always read these things. And the reason I know he read them is
                    because he always insisted on having a meeting then, and he would call on me to
                    present my views, which I would do. The reason I know he read them was that he
                    would sit there without looking at them and he'd say, “Now, George, you say on
                    page nine” so-and-so. “I don't see how you can possibly defend that.” So then
                    I'd defend it. “And on page fourteen you say” so-and-so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're not bluffing when you can do that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: No, he wasn't bluffing. I always sat next to him at the table. So I know he
                    wasn't reading from anybody's notes. He read them, and it was perfectly clear
                    that he read them. And invariably without exception I think he always thanked
                    me, as he put it, for disagreeing with him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they ever occasion, in being presented that
                        frequently, what you considered really a basic reconsideration of some of
                        the premises by the other principals?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Not basically consideration of some of the premises. But what did happen
                    was that the President on two or three occasions said at the end of the day,
                    “Look, I agree with George. I think he's right. We're not going to do this
                    thing. I don't agree with you, Bob, you've got to make your case. I don't agree
                    with you, Mac. We're not going to do it.”</p>
                <p>But we ended up by doing it a couple of weeks later, because events moved on and
                    pressures built up and so on. I think I slowed the process, let me put it that
                    way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And didn't destroy your effectiveness with the President,
                        as far as you know?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>BALL: Not so far as I know. My relations with the President, by anything he ever
                    indicated to me, always remained very good. I always had the feeling that I
                    could say anything to the President.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He didn't block you out because he knew you were going to
                        be unsympathetic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: No. Let me say if I had found myself excluded from meetings as the Vice
                    President did, for example, then I would probably have quit. But, on the
                    contrary, I was always involved. And very often when we'd have something up,
                    he'd turn to me and say, “All right, George, let's hear what you have to say
                    against this, because I know you will.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Does that mean, though, that you became kind of the house
                        critic? I mean, just going through the motions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: He used to use the term, “You're my devil's advocate,” but it was never a
                    stylized affair, as far as I was concerned. I think that he did this rather
                    deliberately, and I was prepared to accept it on these terms, because after the
                    Alsop leak I think he wanted and I think they spread the word around the White
                    House that, “George Ball is just sort of doing this on an institutionalized
                    basis, just always filing the brief for the other side.” Which was not the case.
                    What I was doing was deeply felt out of my own guts here. I wouldn't have sat up
                    until three or four o'clock in the morning doing it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You don't stylize something at three o'clock in the
                        morning!BALL: The interesting thing about all of this from my point of view
                        was not only the President's response, but the fact that we had very, very
                        hot arguments that never affected my relations with Dean Rusk or Bob
                        McNamara. Bob McNamara may have felt angry at me from time to time—and the
                        others [may have]—but it was never a personal matter, let me put it that
                        way. And it was never taken that way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you said the first memorandum dated from September of
                        1964.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: It was dated October 5, as I recall, but it was written [beginning in late
                    September].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That came after the Tonkin attack, and you also were a
                        primary principal in that, I understand.</hi>

                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>BALL: Yes. But at that time I think my views were fairly well known, but they
                    hadn't been put down on paper. I mean, I would urge them in the councils. This
                    was the first time I deliberately sat down and reduced to paper my very strong
                    feelings about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you describe the Tonkin affair from the vantage point
                        that you occupied in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: When the first Tonkin Gulf thing occurred, Rusk was away. I was again
                    acting secretary of state. That always seemed to happen during a crisis. There
                    is one interesting thing which actually I discovered the other day reading one
                    of these telegrams, telecons, and that is I talked to McNamara and I talked to
                    Bundy in the course of the afternoon following the [Tonkin attack].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say Bundy without a first name, you mean
                        Mac?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Mac, yes. Bill Bundy was really a—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He wasn't even an assistant secretary—oh, yes, he was by
                        then in September, 1964.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Bill is offended with me because I apparently said in the Star the other
                    day that Bill was more the technician than the man of substance. Well, this was
                    certainly true. He was not in the top councils. He was an assistant secretary of
                    state. From time to time, we would have him there but this was simply to outline
                    a plan, something of this sort. But he was not one of the top three or four
                    people that were always talking to the President about these things.</p>
                <p>I talked to them in the course of that afternoon—I believe it was the afternoon
                    after the Tonkin Gulf, because one gets mixed up there because of the
                    international date line. But talking to Bob McNamara, talking to Mac Bundy, our
                    principal concern was one thing: that there would be a kind of orgasm of outrage
                    in the Congress and that some of the right-wing hawk Republicans might take such
                    action that would be in effect a declaration of war or would put the
                    administration in a position where we had to do things which we thought would be
                    very unwise, that might involve bringing the Chinese in or offending somebody
                    else. So we talked about it. And I think it was McNamara who suggested it to me
                    that wouldn't it might not be a good idea to leak it out that there had been a
                    34-A attack, and that while they were not related, the other side might have
                    thought they were related, and therefore if it attacked the Houston. . It wasn't
                    the Houston first. It was the other one, whatever it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was the Maddox first.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>BALL: The Maddox, yes. It was because they were confused by these things—in order
                    to blunt the effect.</p>
                <p>Now, that was the first attack. The second attack was a different matter. We
                    didn't know for a time whether it was a real attack or not. The only real
                    confirmatory evidence which came in later was the intercept of the radio from
                    the mainland. But I think that the President always had considerable doubt
                    during at least part of that period and even afterwards in a sort of kidding
                    way, he would say to McNamara, “Well, those fish [certainly] were swimming,” or
                    something.</p>
                <p>But anyway during the time that we were seriously considering action we thought
                    it was genuine. Then we thought it might not be. And then when the instructions
                    were finally given—they were given subject to there being confirmed that there
                    had been an actual attack—the President decided that this was the time to go up
                    to Congress, that we were going to probably have to do some more things, and
                    that was the time to go up to Congress and bring Congress fully in, and that
                    this was a very good occasion to do it. And the fact that we were giving some
                    direction to a congressional action might save the Congress from doing something
                    more extreme.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: I can't remember. I think I had a slight hand in tinkering with the
                    language, but I don't know who wrote it. I think it was based on an original
                    Bill Bundy draft. I think it was redrafted in the White House. I think I made
                    some lawyer suggestions at the end.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: Yes, the draft that Bill Bundy had written earlier which was too long and
                    wordy, as I recall.</p>

                <p>BALL: Yes, I went up. I was always the President's ambassador to Bill Fulbright.
                    I went up, as I recall, and I spent quite a lot of time with the Foreign
                    Relations Committee, trying to get this thing through.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: I think that what happened with him—and I like Fulbright, I don't mean to
                    be unfair to him—he simply hadn't given the matter all that much thought at the
                    time; perhaps didn't read all the implications into it that one might have if
                    he'd studied it more carefully. The language was perfectly clear; it was
                    extremely far-reaching language. But, even so, it didn't go so far beyond that
                    Near Eastern Resolution at the time of the Lebanese invasion, or the—</p>

                <p>BALL: I don't think so. “Let's go get this authority.” It didn't seem to me that
                    implied in this was much more than that. “Let's get some authority from
                    Congress,” rather than act entirely—again, this was perhaps a lawyer's
                    instinct—on the basis of the implied powers of the President, war powers of the
                    President. I just thought we ought to tidy up. That was really what it was.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So he was engaged in Vietnam to that extent. Had he been
                        in on any of the so-called decisions that had been so much subject to
                        discussion in connection with the Pentagon Papers? The 34-A decisions,
                        contingency plans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: No, I don't think he had ever heard of it. I can't be sure of this. My
                    recollection is that he had never heard of the 34-A. I'm not even sure I had
                    myself.</p>
                <p>Now, on all of those 34-A decisions, let me say that, as I recall, the
                    authorization which was approved by the Ten-Eleven Committee or some damned
                    thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think that's the name of it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Too, the command in the Southeast Asia theater was fairly broad, so if they
                    wanted to run a particular 34-A operation, they ran it. I don't think the
                    individual operation had to be approved, just the program of operations. With
                    respect to that particular committee, our representative on the committee was
                    Alex Johnson, and Alex had the practice of before going to one of these
                    committees, he would bring in the proposals and the files which they were going
                    to consider and show them to me, and he would get my instructions as to the
                    position that the department would take. This didn't always happen because
                    sometimes I was away, but I had confidence in Alex, and he acted on his own. But
                    when I was there, this was always done.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And this is as high as it got.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: This is as high as it got. And in the Pentagon, it was Ros Gilpatric who
                    was doing it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The same level.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it your understanding that there existed in early
                        September of 1964, as the Pentagon Papers seem to be saying, a consensus
                        that we were going to start bombing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: There wasn't any consensus. There were a lot of people thinking, you know,
                    “This situation is not good. Let's think of all the contingencies.'' And
                    everybody who was working on South Vietnam was writing papers about this or that
                    type of program. There wasn't any consensus at all.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And certainly not a presidential decision?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Certainly not a presidential decision. No, he definitely didn't make it. He
                    didn't want to make this decision. He was always a very reluctant fellow, but he
                    always got kind of dragged along, kicking and screaming. The impetus toward
                    escalation never came from Lyndon Johnson, I can assure you of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There did occur that fall several instances that might
                        have provoked the same kind of retaliation that we took in Tonkin Gulf and
                        we didn't take retaliatory action.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they involve presidential refusal?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Usually. The President would say, “Yes, we're not going to do this.” And
                    then what happened really, the reason why the bombing started in February, it
                    didn't have anything to do with any very clear decision that something had to be
                    done to the North, but that something had to be done for the South. There had
                    been a whole sordid series of coups, a feeling that the whole political fabric
                    of South Vietnam was beginning to disintegrate, and that we had to do something
                    very fair and affirmative if we were going to keep this damned thing from
                    falling apart. That's what happened. It was a great bucker-upper for South
                    Vietnam. That was the Whole reason for it. I say the whole reason. That was
                    really the reason for it.</p>
                <p>Now the problem that I was encountering at that time, particularly with Bob
                    McNamara—and, again, I don't want to be unfair to him. He was the one who had
                    the responsibility for the war in a rather special sense, in the military sense.
                    He was under enormous pressures from his own soldiers and sailors and airmen to
                    escalate, and he resisted. He made his own decisions, and he kept the thing
                    under very considerable control and under great restraint. But the reaction I
                    always had from him was—he would put up a proposal, and I would say, “Well, I
                    don't think it's demonstrated that this is going to achieve the purpose at all,
                    and I don't think that the argument has been made in any convincing form that
                    this can succeed or that it's going to do any good. The cost could be very
                    considerable, and it's one more step on this road,” and so on. He had a set
                    answer, which was, “All right, George, what do you propose to do?” I had a set
                    answer, too. I proposed that we cut our losses and get the hell out. But that
                    was no [acceptable] answer.</p>

                <p>BALL: Well, they did with the Edsel, but ....</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: It was an unacceptable answer in the current mood at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had anybody joined you by February of 1965 in that point
                        of view in regard to the bombing when the bombing decision was being
                        made?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: No. That was the general attitude I had toward every act of escalation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But you were still alone as late as February of 1965?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: I was alone in the top councils. If Bill Bundy tells me he had lots of
                    reservations, and I suspect he did—Bill is an honest man—he never argued them in
                    any direct or vigorous way, even to me. He would always say, “You're
                    overstating. You've overestimated this thing. It isn't as bad as you say,” and
                    so on. I think there were people in the department who were beginning to feel
                    this way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lower down, you mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Yes. My own personal assistant, George Springsteen, I think agreed with me.
                    Abe Chayes, who was in the consular department. But they were in a position
                    where they couldn't make their voices felt.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the bombing did start, was it clearly understood by
                        everybody that this was going to be a permanently instituted policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: No. It started on a so-called tit-for-tat basis. Max Taylor was pressing
                    this idea of gradually escalating the thing. I had a kind of sense of fatality
                    that I wasn't going to keep it from happening. It would indeed happen. Once you
                    get one of those things going, it's just like getting a little alcohol; you're
                    going to get a taste for more. It's a compelling thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it seriously considered that the bombing program
                        itself might call for a greatly expanded ground force, if for nothing else,
                        to protect the air activity?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: I wrote one paper which is not in the presidential file. I guess to make
                    this complete if you want any documentation on paper, I'll get you a copy of
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'd like to, if it's not in the presidential files
                        particularly.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: I'll tell you why it isn't in the presidential files. It was a paper that I
                    wrote to President Johnson describing the escalatory steps which would follow
                    one another until we got into deep trouble—a war with China and a war with the
                    Soviet Union and so on—because I wanted to take him through this. I wrote it,
                    and then I tried to negotiate it with McNamara and Bundy. We spent a whole
                    afternoon going over this, and they disagreed with me on one significant point.
                    They weren't going to be a part of that. Llewellyn Thompson went with me pretty
                    much the whole way. So then I wrote it for the President as a paper which
                    reflected the views of Thompson and myself and of Bundy and McNamara, with the
                    significant differences which we noted. I sent this to the President and he
                    called me and said come over. I went over with Mac Bundy. I think this was on a
                    Saturday. We sat down and C went through it step-by-step and explained the logic
                    for each step. Then he did something that he had never done before. At the end
                    of I suppose an hour and a half or two hours with him, he handed the paper back.
                    So I have the original.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's why it's not in the files.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: That's why it's not in the files. I suspect it would be in the files of the
                    Pentagon, although it hasn't appeared, to the best of my knowledge. But I'll get
                    you a copy of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things you suggested was that ground troops
                        would be a necessary follow-up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you think that was fully understood by the people who

                </p>
                <p>BALL: Nobody was prepared to concede that any particular step would require any
                    further step. This was kind of a standard assumption which I kept repeating
                    again and again was a false assumption. The argument that I kept making through
                    these memoranda. I remember quoting Emerson about “things are in the saddle” and
                    “You're losing control. You go forward with this further step, and you will
                    substantially have lost control. Finally, you're going to find the war is
                    running you, and we're not running the war.”</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: No, it wasn't made that early. As a matter of fact, the very big review
                    that we had wasn't, in my recollection, until June. Then we spent a week
                    fighting this thing out, and there had been no decision taken.</p>

                </p>

                    Bundy's supervision. They gave it to me at the very last minute, saying, “It's
                    just going into page proof,” and so on. I read it and said, “I think this is
                    absolutely appalling. It doesn't prove a damned thing.” So then I made an effort
                    to strengthen it, and I rewrote parts of it, and so on. But even so I thought it
                    was terrible. I always thought it was terrible.</p>

                <p>BALL: I was a trained lawyer. I thought this was a most unpersuasive brief. It
                    never seemed to me—and particularly this technique of taking a special case
                    history and tracing it through and drawing lots of conclusions from it, I didn't
                    think you could do that.</p>

                        this time? Was there optimism in the State Department?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: It depended on what parts of the State Department you're talking about. I
                    remember saying to Bill Bundy once on a certain measure of escalation that, “I
                    don't think this thing has a chance. I think it's absurd to be putting this up
                    and seriously going for it.” I said, “What do you think the chances are?” “Oh,”
                    he said, “10 or 15 per cent.” I said, “That's absolute nonsense for a great
                    government to go ahead on as potentially costly a program of this kind in terms
                    of lives, in terms of ancillary breakings that might occur on that kind of a
                    risk. It's just a lousy business judgment. You can't do it.”</p>
                <p>I think it differed from one man to another. I think that McNamara up through
                    that period was absolutely convinced that one could make a quantitative
                    demonstration, given the disparity in resources between the United States and
                    the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong; that if we didn't impose our will on the
                    country, it was simply because we weren't using those resources properly and
                    weren't being sufficiently skillful and imaginative. Therefore, it was a
                    tremendous challenge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But doable?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: It was doable, because the figures demonstrated it. With Rusk, it was quite
                    a different thing. He was enormously influenced by his experience during the
                    Korean War. He had been a key element in the Korean situation and Korea, so far
                    as he was concerned, had been a great success. So I would say, “Look, you've got
                    no government. It's impossible to win in a situation where you've got this
                    totally fragile political base. These people are clowns.'! Whereupon, he'd say,
                    “Don't give me that stuff. You don't understand that at the time of Korea that
                    we had to go out and dig Syngman Rhee out of the bush where he was hiding; there
                    was no government in Korea either, and we were able to come through. We're going
                    to get the same breaks down the road. One of these days something is going to
                    happen, and this thing is going to work, just as it did in Korea.” I think he
                    believes that almost to this day. He said on television the other night that he
                    had misappraised the will of the staying power.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>I had quite a differing... I resented the idea that there was any particular
                    wisdom on one side or the other. Everyone was responding to his own set of
                    experiences. Bob McNamara was analyzing this thing as a man who was trained in
                    quantification, who believed in systems analysis, who believed in application of
                    games theory to strategy, who was enormously persuaded by the disparity in
                    military power. This was his approach.</p>
                <p>I think that Mac Bundy saw this as a fascinating set of operational problems. I
                    think he assumed that we were so clever, somehow we could find the key hook.</p>
                <p>For myself, I had a whole different set of experiences. As a practicing lawyer, I
                    had had among my clients various agencies of the French government when they
                    went through the Indo-Chinese experience. I had heard everything before. I used
                    to tell this to the President when McNamara was present, and it would just drive
                    him up the wall. I'd say, “Look, Mr. President, everything that the Secretary of
                    Defense has been telling you this morning, I used to listen to with my French
                    friends. They talked about the body count. They talked the relative kill ratios.
                    They talked about the fact that there was always a new plan, and with a little
                    increment of effort, the Navarre Plan, the DeLattre de Tassigny Plan, and so on,
                    that was going to win the day. And they believed it just as much as we're
                    believing it sitting around the table this morning. I can tell you, however,
                    that in the end, there was a great disillusion. And there will be one.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it didn't get through.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: It didn't get through. And as you will note, if you ever see those
                    memoranda, a lot of them were filled with references to the French experience.
                    That was no particular wisdom on my part. I just had a feeling that this was a
                    terrible place to commit power, that there was no political base on which it
                    could rest, and that the physical terrain was awful, what President De Gaulle
                    described to me as “rotten country.”Q: I'm not, as I move along here, leaving
                    out a lot of important things, particularly the peace initiatives. I want to go
                    through them chronologically together, if you don't mind. I'd like to get the
                    rest of these escalation decisions in chronological order.</p>

                <p>BALL: We could do some work tomorrow morning for a while. Tonight I ought to

                        go. Then tomorrow morning we can probably do a vast portion of it. Let me
                        check on the situation. (Interruption) The Honolulu Conference: of early
                        1966 coincides with Fulbright's nationally televised hearings. What role did
                        you play in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: I never went to any of those conferences. I just viewed the whole idea of a
                    conference as being absolutely appalling because I was convinced that the
                    President got out there with whoever happened to be the head of the government
                    in Vietnam, and we were going to get in deeper and deeper and deeper. So every
                    time anybody suggested a conference I shuddered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What do you think his purposes were in all of the whole
                        procession of conferences?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: I'd get the feeling that he really wanted to see these people, but the
                    response of one politician to another, you know, is automatic and usually rather
                    overstated. What we were doing was visibly, before the world's eyes, tying
                    ourselves onto one sordid little politician after another, and this just
                    disturbed me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, right after that one, South Vietnam went
                        through one of its really worst periods of chaos, I guess, the struggle and
                        movement of early 1966. That apparently occasioned another full-scale review
                        of policy and another one of your memoranda, I suppose, opposing it. Was
                        that basically different than any of the others that preceded it, that
                        review? Had it gotten a lot more serious then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: If you want to wait just a second, I think I've got that book of memoranda
                    there. (Interruption)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What I was really trying to do was really see if there's a
                        real difference in the way that the reviews took place over time. Did enough
                        people begin to take your doubts more seriously by early 1966 that there was
                        a difference in the way the review came out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: No, because actually what happened was in a curious way the persuasiveness
                    of my view diminished with time simply because we were deeper and deeper and
                    deeper in. Therefore, people could always say, “Well, it's too late. And even if
                    we wanted to get out, it's too late to get out.” Bob McNamara took that position
                    at the end. “Well, it's too late.” This was the problem. That's the theme that
                    runs through these memoranda, as you can see.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I guess the last really drastic military decision that was
                        taken while you were still under secretary was the decision to bomb the
                        Haiphong POL in the early summer of 1966. How were you involved in
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: I tried my very best to stop that. I think there's a memorandum in there
                    about it. I tried to get them to follow it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: McNamara was as strong that late in favor as he had been

                </p>
                <p>BALL: Toward the end of the time I was in the department, I got a sense from Bob
                    of real anxiety that “We've got to settle this thing. Let's get the diplomatic
                    machinery going and get it settled.” His idea of diplomacy, as I have gathered,
                    was just to send a lot of people out to talk to a lot of people. Well, I didn't
                    think we had any absence of channels, any lack of channels. The problem was we
                    weren't prepared to say anything that could be a basis for settlement. So that
                    while I felt this anxiety, I knew it was genuine.</p>
                <p>And John McNaughton at that time had developed very serious doubts. John would
                    get me aside and say, “Gee, I agree with you, but Bob won't quite buy this.” But
                    John comes out very badly in the Pentagon Papers, I think quite unfairly because
                    he was a rather early dove.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: Yes, as I recall, I was scheduled in a unique position where I think he
                    told me, “My God, do what you can.” I did launch one venture.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: Wait a minute. There was the Gullion affair. There was another one, whether
                    it was subsequent or prior I don't know, in which I used a fellow I had known,
                    who was a retired Foreign Service Officer living in Spain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sturm.</hi>
                </p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's subsequent to, I think, the Gullion. But there
                        were, then, the inklings of things far earlier than that. I've been told,
                        for example, that the Seaborne initiative, which has been played up in the
                        Pentagon Papers, was in fact, at least in part, an effort to get discussions
                        going. Was that your impression of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: It was. Don't think these weren't genuine efforts to get discussions going.
                    They were foredoomed efforts, because we weren't prepared to make any real
                    concessions. Negotiation at that time still consisted pretty much of saying to
                    Hanoi, “Look, let's work out a deal under which you will capitulate.” And
                    therefore I never had much optimism about any of these things, but I thought it
                    was useful to keep things going. But the problem was that while people say they
                    desperately wanted to negotiate, they never were prepared to make any real
                    concessions.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there an agreement as to what we would say if Hanoi
                        had agreed to talk?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Yes, but it was not an agreement that really conceded anything.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you sort out the Adlai Stevenson-U Thant alleged
                        initiative in the fall of 1964?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>BALL: This is a real headache, and I was in the middle of it very much. What
                    happened was that Stevenson called up Rusk one day and said that he had been
                    talking to Thant and Thant had had this signal. I've forgotten the exact form of
                    it and I once knew it intimately because I got deeply engaged in it. And at that
                    time we had some other things going; Rusk didn't want to encourage a new
                    channel, particularly because he had no particular confidence in U Thant anyway
                    who had a real Burmese view of the whole situation. So he didn't make any note
                    about this thing, and he didn't mention it because he didn't regard it as very
                    significant. All this was really was a kind of suggestion that there might be
                    another kind of channel started. We had lots of channels going. I don't think he
                    really thought anything about it. It was not deliberately brushing aside the
                    possibility of making peace. He just thought this was Stevenson's anxiety to do
                    something. He never mentioned it to me.</p>
                <p>Then after Stevenson died there was that curious piece that Eric Sevareid wrote
                    which, knowing Adlai for thirty-five years, was just Adlai blowing off. I don't
                    think it was anything very serious. Stevenson was a great complainer, and he was
                    always seeing things. But if you'd known him well, I think you could have
                    understood it. If he happened to feel unhappy that particular evening. . And he
                    hated his job at the U.N. by and large; he never wanted it. But that's another
                    very long story.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Unfortunately the story came out as if this was said in
                        all sincerity, and people who don't know Stevenson are likely to take it at
                        its face value.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Then I found myself in the position of talking to Thant about this thing.
                    As I recall, I had two long sessions with Thant, in which Thant insisted on
                    telling me this story from the very beginning. And each time he told it
                    differently. (Laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there's no straight version of it, not even in Thant's
                        mind.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: In Thant's mind, it expanded and it enlarged and he embellished it, and it
                    was a much more attractive thing the second time than it was the first. So I
                    decided it was hopeless.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the other channels that we had going. These
                        were in the fall of 1964? What kind of channels were we using then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: You know, the assumption that we had channels through the Hungarians that
                    we played with a long time and which Rusk got rather excited about, this
                    Hungarian foreign minister.</p>

                    his Ph.D., and he has gotten an appointment to the University of
                    Mississippi.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: A very good guy. But there was that Peter initiative.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We weren't actually talking to North Vietnamese that
                        early?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: No. The Polish initiative didn't amount to anything. I think you've
                    probably seen this stuff now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Early in 1965 we undertook some talks with the British and
                        Russians as co-chairmen of the Geneva Conference apparently. What did we
                        have in mind at that point with them? Anything serious?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Sure, it was to see what the possibilities were. The Russians were always
                    leading us on. We'd get rumors through the underground that the Russians really
                    wanted some approach from us and wanted to play some role; then when we'd test
                    it out, nothing would ever happen. This was pretty much the normal thing.</p>

                        bombing pause. Was that in connection with any program design to get
                        anything started?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: It was hopeful that we could, yes.</p>

                <p>BALL: We had a session down at the Ranch in which we were all down there.
                    McNamara took the lead in that, and I joined him.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: What was that? May of 1965.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: I don't know. Let me just say one thing. Looking at my telecons at that
                    time, it's perfectly clear that I was spending no more than one-tenth of my time
                    on Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Right, and I want to talk to you more about the other
                        things, too. It's hard to understand now, because it became such a big part
                        of the show, but during this period we were having Congo crises, we were
                        having crises—Cyprus.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Cyprus. On all of these things I was spending far more of my time thinking
                    and acting with regard to other things. I spend an awful lot of time on that
                    Beef Import Bill and things of that sort that people are quite not aware of now.
                    So it's very hard for me to keep a chronology straight about these particular
                    things. I don't know. You asked me about...</p>

                <p>BALL: I mean, you have to guard it with your life, because I have no business

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. The episode with Ed Gullion came, as I understand
                        it, in the late part of the summer of 1965. That was peculiarly your
                        operation. It was my initiative. It was my idea. Did you sell this to the
                        President?</hi>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: On the grounds that I wanted to get a disavowable contact with him to see
                    what would come of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it seem for a while to be more hopeful than some of
                        these other earlier ones that you've talked about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: I thought it might be, and particularly the Sturm one. Was that afterwards?
                    I guess it was.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: The Sturm one. I don't know that at that time.I just mentioned to the
                    President, “I've got something going, and I'm not going to tell you what it is,”
                    or something like that. So he accepted that. You know, a disavowable
                    contact.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Sturm one and the Gullion one were not
                        connected?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: I think the Gullion one didn't get very far; therefore, I fell back on the
                    Sturm one. I think that was it. I don't think Gullion ever knew about Sturm.
                    Maybe he did, but I don't think so.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did anything happen to make it come to nothing? I'm
                        thinking in terms of military activity that might have been unfortunate, as

                </p>

                    it just petered out. Now whether there were some military events that may have
                    effected the thing, or whether Mai Van Bo got instructions from Hanoi: “Don't go
                    anywhere with this fellow,” or what, I don't know.</p>

                <p>BALL: I had a set of instructions, which I worked on very carefully, as to just
                    what we were prepared to do. I couldn't reproduce them now if my life depended
                    on it. They are in that file. They'll be in the White House.</p>

                <p>BALL: “Well, this guy was acting on his own.” And Sturm was the kind of fellow
                    that could be trusted. I'd never use a newspaperman. I'd never use the normal

                <p>We all went down to the Ranch, and I guess it was probably early December. Both
                    Bob and I made quite strong pitches for the pause. Rusk was not very much in
                    favor of the pause. He just felt that we would get nowhere and we'd be in worse
                    shape at the end of it. As I recall, there was no decision taken. We came back
                    to Washington. And then I have a house in Florida and I went down for just a
                    week, which was about the only vacation I had gotten in six years. I think I was
                    away from the department for twenty-four days which included Sundays. And the
                    President called me and said, “Look, you wanted a pause, and now, dammit, you're
                    going to have a pause. You'd better get on an airplane and get back up here. I'm
                    sending you a plane.</p>

                        over the country? Was that something that he was advised to do by the State

                </p>
                <p>BALL: He wanted to make a great demonstration. He called me in. “Who should I
                    send?” I was out in Virginia for some reason. He came out with that, on who we
                    should send. So I was recommending people to send all over the place. The people
                    I recommended were people I thought could do business, and the people he wanted
                    to send were people who were too conspicuous.</p>

                <p>BALL: I don't think so. I mean it was too flamboyant an affair. You can't begin
                    to negotiate that way because the other side immediately reads this as a major
                    effort to put them on the spot.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The initiative presumed to have been taken at that time by
                        the Poles—what's his name, Neolovsky?—going to Hanoi was more show than

                </p>
                <p>BALL: I suspect so. I don't think there was anything serious there. I suspect it
                    was no more serious than the whole Peter affair.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: I'm going to do a piece in this little Newsweek column for next time on the
                    frightfulness of self-appointed peacemakers. I think they really get in the way
                    more than they ever help.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: No. The trouble with the self-confessed peacemaker is that, in the first
                    place, he always goes desperately wanting to hear the other side say what he
                    wants them to say. So he always hears them say that. He always comes back and
                    reports that, when they haven't said anything different from what they've been
                    saying for a long time. He reads everything into it. Then he insists on going to
                    the press and announcing exactly what he's been doing. I think these fellows
                    confuse the situation terribly.</p>

                        Harold Wilson, or Glassboro, or any of those?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: I knew vaguely what was going on. For a period again of course in 1968 I
                    was in the government. Not really, no. I didn't have any confidence in this. I
                    didn't have any confidence ever after a very point in a negotiated solution.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because of our viewpoint?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Because we weren't asking for a negotiated solution. We were asking the
                    other side to capitulate, in effect, to give up everything they had been
                    striving to do for twenty-five years. And this I was convinced they were not
                    going to do. This reflected to a considerable extent my French period.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That takes us through the various initiatives until you
                        left office and pretty much through Vietnam. I may think of some other
                        things after looking at these tonight, but why don't we put in tomorrow
                        talking about the 90 per cent of your time doing other things and any
                        specific questions I might have?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Sure.</p>
                <p>******</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think maybe a good thing at the beginning would be to
                        put on [tape] that I've read through your file of memoranda, and your
                        caution to me, I think, is worthwhile for anyone who may be doing that in
                        the future.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Right. At this point I know you last night read the file of memoranda which
                    I sent to President Johnson during the period from October, 1964 through the
                    middle of 1966.</p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>I think I might say one word in explanation of these memoranda. As you no doubt
                    noticed, the successive memoranda represent on my part a falling back from a
                    more categorical and original position. The reason for this was, of course, that
                    I was fighting, as I saw it even in those days, a rearguard action. I was trying
                    to slow down or prevent the escalation of the war. I was trying to persuade the
                    President and my other colleagues that we should systematically seek to cut our
                    losses and disengage from what seemed to me from the very beginning a quite
                    untenable position, primarily because I thought that both the political and
                    physical terrain of South Vietnam were impossible for the effective utilization
                    of the American force and that we should not commit it to such a terrain.</p>
                <p>The result is that, as one reads the memoranda, it becomes clear that I was
                    prepared at various times to concede things that had already been decided. This
                    was tactically necessary if I were to have any credibility with my colleagues
                    whatever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I think it is important to keep that in mind when
                        reading any individual one of the memoranda.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Yes, if they're taken out of sequence it would appear that, say, by the
                    middle of 1966 I was ready to concede that what had been done with respect to a
                    great many things was quite right. This was necessary, simply because the
                    decisions had already been taken, and to have challenged them at that time would
                    have been not only futile, but it would have created unnecessary argument and
                    led to the questioning of the credibility of everything I was contending to
                    do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Most of the questions that the memoranda raise, so we
                        mentioned at least yesterday—there are a few that we didn't... In the summer
                        of 1965 you're talking about something you refer to as the Acheson plan. Do
                        I infer properly that this was to be a joint United States-South Vietnamese
                        announced program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: As a matter of fact, there is a memorandum in there which is not mine. I
                    should explain this. Let me get the memoranda in front of me, so it'll be easier
                    to explain.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think I can pick it out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: It was with a number of supplements. Let me give you the background for
                    this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's June 1965 or slightly before?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>BALL: Here it is. On April 21, 1965 I was at a meeting with the President, and
                    some proposal for escalation was under consideration at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Troop commitment at that time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: It was a matter of troop commitments. And I made a very strong argument
                    against going forward with this. I said to the President that, “I am satisfied
                    that there might be a chance of transferring the contest from the battlefield to
                    the ballot,” that we ought to take advantage of what appeared at that time as a
                    possible diplomatic opening provided by the North Vietnamese in its answer to
                    the Seventeen Nations' Declaration. I stated that I could very quickly give him
                    a memorandum that outlined a serious diplomatic possibility that we ought to
                    consider. And he said, “All right, let me have it by the end of the
                    afternoon.”</p>
                <p>So that was the memorandum of April 21, 1965 entitled, “Should We Try to Move
                    Toward a Vietnamese Settlement Now,” in which I outlined the arguments for doing
                    so, and then suggested that there might be a program that could be worked out
                    for this.</p>
                <p>I gave this to the President, and we talked about it. I said if it was agreeable
                    with him that I was going to enlist Dean Acheson to come in and work with me in
                    the developments of such a program and in working it out in detail. So he said,
                    “Fine.” I asked Dean to come in and we worked for two weeks together on the
                    development of a program which now appears as something entitled, “A Plan for
                    Political Resolution of South Vietnam.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I see. That's a joint Acheson-Ball recommendation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: What it was was an effort on Acheson's part to translate into rather
                    specific terms a plan which I had outlined in rather general terms, which called
                    for a series of actions to be taken by the South Vietnamese government.</p>
                <p>Now after the Acheson plan was developed I sent a young man who was on my
                    personal staff by the name of Tom Ehrlich, who is presently the dean of the
                    Stanford Law School, on a secret mission to go over it with—who was it, Lodge or
                    Max Taylor?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was Taylor by then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: It must have been Taylor. With Taylor and Alex Johnson, who was there. And
                    they threw cold water all over it.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's what happened to it ultimately, then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Yes. They simply took the position that it would be very awkward for them
                    even to raise these questions seriously with the South Vietnamese
                    government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was not something that grew out of any senior
                        advisory group? This was a straight relation with Acheson by you, to come up
                        with solutions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Oh, sure. The senior advisory group never really functioned in this
                    area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the 1965-66 Christmas pause, you have a long memo
                        in the file there—the original I think is at the very back of the
                        book—referred to as Pinta-Maria, in which you are suggesting a secret
                        communication for a six-power conference. Both that original and the copy
                        that's attached to it are marked, “Not sent. D.R.” What were the
                        circumstances of that suggestion on your part? Apparently it was an attempt
                        to get something started while the bombing pause continued, and you're
                        laying out some options with the six-power conference as the most preferred
                        one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Offhand, I don't remember. That is Dean Rusk's handwriting. I must have
                    shown it to Dean and found that he was so opposed to it that we just decided not
                    to bother the President with it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It did not become a major issue that sticks in your
                        mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: No. Actually, as I mentioned to you, I followed one practice invariably. I
                    never sent a thing to the President that I didn't send to McNamara, Bundy, and
                    Rusk to give them a crack at it, because I didn't believe in mixed party
                    dealings on these things.</p>
                <p>This, to the best of my knowledge, is the only memoranda that was not sent to the
                    President. Everything else was considered by the President, except there is one
                    memorandum which we spoke of last night and which won't be in the Texas
                    files—but it's here—and which the President read and which we discussed at some
                    length.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know what the code name “Pinta” refers to. What about
                        “Maria?”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: I don't remember at this time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of your memoranda there mentioned, when you were
                        arguing that the resumption of bombing should not occur, some initiatives
                        that took place in Laos through ambassador [William] Sullivan and Souvanna
                        Phouma. Were these more hopeful than perhaps had been indicated before
                        publicly, in your opinion? The North Vietnamese charge in Vientiane
                        apparently approached Souvanna, who then ....</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Oh, yes. I thought at the time that something might be stirring. It looked
                    a little possible. I never had great confidence that we'd ever work anything
                    out, but again I was seizing at straws, as you can imagine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nothing came ultimately out of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: No. I've forgotten. The meetings, as I recall, just never came off, or if
                    they did, there was one that turned out to be rather stiff and formal. I can't
                    remember exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is the same thing true of the contacts in Rangoon with
                        Ambassador [Henry A.] Byroade?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Yes, same thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Just formal, non-substantive. That is apparent, but it
                        could raise a question. When you were strenuously opposing the resumption of
                        bombing, were you joined by anybody? [Did] anybody else who was basically in
                        favor of the policy think that that might be a good thing to do at this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: To the best of my recollection, there wasn't anybody else. I think I was
                    alone.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You said a while ago that the senior advisory group was
                        not in fact an institutionalized—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Let me say one thing: one of the things that President Johnson used to say
                    to me about the bombing pause was, “If I say we'll have a bombing pause for
                    thirty days, I know that at the end of that thirty days, George, you're going to
                    argue against resuming.”Q: Do you think it's true that that long bombing pause
                    really affected the President adversely in the long run? I've been told that
                    once that occurred he thought that he'd been tricked into it or pressured into
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>BALL: He was always very suspicious of the bombing pauses for a reason which is
                    hard fully to appreciate at this time. He was deeply convinced, I think, that
                    the real danger in American public opinion was the hawkish right wing, that they
                    were all the time pushing him into things that he was doing his best to resist.
                    The last thing in the world that he wanted was to get into a war with China or
                    with the Soviet Union, and he remembered very well the Korean experience. So his
                    concern about a bombing pause was, “If I go through a long bombing pause and
                    nothing happens, then the pressures to escalate are going to be almost
                    irresistible.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It wasn't the fact of the pause that bothered him so
                        much.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: It wasn't the fact of the pause, although it did bother him that in the
                    meantime it was giving the other side a chance to move through the end zone. But
                    the big consideration in his mind was the one of the play of forces on the
                    domestic scene. I think he was deeply and very honestly concerned at the fact
                    that this would give a very big advantage to the extreme hawks.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which it could have done. When did this so-called senior
                        advisory group start?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: This was an idea of Max Taylor's which he put forward—to have a senior
                    advisory group. Now, which one are we talking about?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm talking about SIG, the so-called Wise Men—”Let's
                        finish off Vietnam quickly”—the Wise Men of the 1967-1968 time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: I see. We had had a meeting—and I can't tell you when it was, but it must
                    have been toward the middle of 1965, I guess—of the Wise Men. I was in the
                    government at that time. So I obviously wasn't in the group. It was Arthur Dean
                    and Dean Acheson and, I think, possibly John Coles, a miscellaneous lot of
                    characters. The President had talked to them about what action should we take,
                    and they were extreme hard-liners. “Don't give them an inch. Go in and bomb and
                    raise hell generally.” At the end of it he turned to me and said, “All right,
                    George, what's your contrary opinion?” So I had spoken to them and made no
                    impression.</p>
                <p>After the meeting I went over to Acheson, and I think Arthur Dean and somebody
                    else was standing there, and I said, “You goddamned old bastards. You remind me
                    of nothing so much as a bunch of buzzards sitting on a fence and letting the
                    young men die. You don't know a goddamned thing about what you're talking
                    about.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's a real problem for these people out of
                        government.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>BALL: Of course it is. I said to them, “You just sit there and say these
                    irresponsible things!” And I said to Dean, “Would you have ever put up with this
                    if you had been secretary of state?”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his answer to that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: He said afterwards that I shook the hell out of him. He said he was very
                    upset by it. (Laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And I'm sure the way he ran the State Department he
                        wouldn't have been very happy with that kind of intervention. Did they meet
                        regularly after that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: No, not very regularly. Every now and then they'd be [called together]. I
                    don't really recall another meeting until—I think it was one I was involved in
                    about November, 1967. Whether there had been another one or not, I don't know.
                    Personally, I just regarded these old characters as nuisances, as I'm sure the
                    people who succeeded me regarded us when we came in.</p>
                <p>In the one in November, 1967 it went very much according to plan. Everyone spoke
                    his little piece; I spoke my customary dissent; and that was the end of it. But
                    I don't think I had a friend among the group, with the opinions I was expressing
                    at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there was a striking difference between that one and
                        the one in 1968?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: This was why the one in 1968 had such an effect. There were so many
                    reversals of position.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say the one in 1967 went according to form. Did the
                        people in the government realize how the one in 1968 was going to change
                        when you called it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: No. I think Clark Clifford, who told me was the one who instigated it, was
                    just hoping to God that the group coming in from outside would change
                    things.</p>
                <p>Now, there's a story that should be told, and it's never been told so far as I
                    know. I've never heard it and never read it. And I can't even give you the
                    timing, but it must have been—when was the long bombing pause? That was in—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1965-66, December 24 to January 20 something.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>BALL: All right. It must have been about the middle of 1965 that we had a
                    meeting. The President had asked Clark Clifford to come in and sort of give his
                    appraisal of the way things were going. And Clark, who had been there once or
                    twice on earlier occasions, had taken a rather hard-line view, I thought,
                    although he hadn't been particularly vocal. On this occasion he gave a long
                    analysis of the situation of the war, which almost completely agreed with what I
                    had been telling the President. And then said to the President, “This war is
                    going to destroy this administration. If things go on as they're going now, and
                    we keep escalating this thing, the American people aren't going to accept it.”
                    He stated it in most lurid terms. There was no particular discussion of what he
                    said and a sort of an embarrassment.</p>
                <p>I got hold of Clark .immediately after the meeting, because he and I were old
                    friends. I said, “Come into the Fish Room with me. I want to talk to you.” So we
                    went into the Fish Room and sat down at the table and I said, “Look. You have
                    said the only sensible thing I have heard said by anybody in that group for a
                    very, very long time. I can only tell you that you and I are in total agreement
                    on this, and I think that your influence with the President is tremendously
                    important. I want to put into your hands for you to read a series of memoranda
                    which I have sent to the President. “Can you handle it?” And he said, “Yes, I am
                    a member of the Intelligence Advisory Board,” or something, “and I have a secure
                    safe in my house.” Which is wired downtown; we all have secure safes. “You have
                    it hand-delivered to me, and I will see that it's taken care of.”</p>
                <p>The next day he called me, and I think I dropped by to see him at his office. He
                    was extremely excited about the memoranda, saying that he thought I was
                    absolutely right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These are the ones you refer to here?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: That's right. And [he said] he was going to have a very hard and long talk
                    with the President. I think he had one talk with the President the day before.
                    When the President saw Clark I was never clear, because at that time they were
                    very close.</p>
                <p>So Clark Clifford was a very early dove. This is something that nobody
                    understands.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the President must have understood it.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: The President must have understood it, and I don't altogether understand.
                    Someday I will have a talk with Clark and try to straighten it out.</p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>At the time of the bombing pause the end of the year, when we were discussing the
                    bombing pause, Clark came in again and made a very strong argument against the
                    bombing pause. It seemed to me almost as though there had been a kind of total
                    volte-face on Clark's part. Clark told me afterwards that this was not any
                    change in his position whatever, but that he thought that a bombing pause was
                    going to spoil whatever chances we had to get this thing slowed down because the
                    escalation that would take place after the bombing pause would be at such a
                    higher rate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's his argument about that bombing pause that has
                        convinced people that he was a hawk still.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: He was not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's the kind of thing that makes all of this activity
                        worthwhile.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: And I've never told that story to a single person.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it will stay on this until—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Clark's going to be interrogated, isn't he?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. I am the one who interviewed Clark Clifford, and he
                        didn't tell me that story either, although he did give some indications that
                        he might have been a dove.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: You don't have another crack at him, do you?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I may make one, because I'd like to go into that with
                        him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>The meeting in 1968, then, that did turn around, that he called, was it—</p>
                <p>BALL: He got the President to call it. I think this was to kind of slow down this
                    possible sending of the 175,000, or whatever the figure was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And it was organized the same way? It wasn't stacked to
                        produce that result?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                <p>BALL: No, it wasn't at all. If you'll remember the dramatis personae, it was
                    Arthur Dean, Doug Dillon, Acheson, Mac Bundy who was by then out of the
                    government, Omar Bradley. I don't know whether Jack McCloy was there or not. He
                    may have been.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: I don't think he was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But the briefing was the same as before?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: It was also Bob Murphy and Abe Fortas.</p>
                <p>This time, I think there was more briefing, a little more systematic briefing. We
                    came down the night before. We had dinner with Rusk, and I think Bob McNamara
                    was there. Then we went in the Operations Center of the State Department and sat
                    at that green baize table there. And we sat around, and we heard these
                    briefings. This was, as you will recall, right after Tet, and the briefings were
                    very pessimistic. I was absolutely delighted with the briefings, because it
                    seemed to me that these were so different from the kind of stylized briefings
                    that department officers and Pentagon officers usually gave that the people were
                    at long last telling the truth. The briefings, as I recall, were by Carver of
                    the CIA, [Philip C.] Habib, I think, wasn't it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The State Department. And DePugh from. .?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: General DePugh. And they were first-rate. They obviously had a very great
                    effect. Then the next morning we had a meeting, I think in the same room. And we
                    discussed it. Then Rusk and Clifford came in. It was clear that there had been a
                    profound change of sentiment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in the majority for a change.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: I was in the majority. Well, actually, when we finally got into the Cabinet
                    Room, I think Mac Bundy's opening statement was, “Mr. President, I must tell you
                    that I'm about to say something I never thought I'd say in my life, that I now
                    agree with George Ball.” (Laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, Bundy had made some noises like he had changed
                        his mind by then in a speech somewhere in the fall.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>BALL: He'd made a speech in Ohio, in which he tried to justify our going in and
                    tried to justify our coming out, which, as I told him afterwards, was the
                    greatest apologia in history for the old Duke of York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the President seem obviously affected by the
                        consensus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: I thought he was greatly shaken by it. Then there was an effort on Walt
                    Rostow's part to some extent to say that these guys have been prated by a very
                    unfair briefing. This was Walt's theme particularly. So then, as I understand
                    it, the President tried to get the briefing officers back and have it repeated
                    to him. Whether they repeated it in quite the same way or not, I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You never will find out, I'm sure, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: The theme that ran around the table was, “You've got to lower your sights.
                    We can't achieve these objectives.” And even Omar Bradley took this line for a
                    truce.</p>
                <p>I think the thing that shook the President most was Acheson, who had been pretty
                    much of a hawk up to that point, although had been willing to work with me on
                    this, because I had used Acheson a great deal. I used him, as you may recall,
                    very greatly on that Cyprus thing, and I'd even had him go to Geneva for a whole
                    damned summer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So Acheson is a professional. He was willing to work that
                        side while he holds contrary views.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: I don't know that he held contrary views. If we could have gotten a
                    settlement on the basis of Lebanon—we never could.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned in your memoranda a number of times when you
                        are trying to convince the President that we should disengage that one of
                        the first things that had to be done was a basic decision by him to accept
                        something less than a flow low [?]. Do you think that after this briefing in
                        March of 1968 and his announcement of stepping down, of the bombing
                        withdrawal, that he really made that kind of a decision?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: He made that decision.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: I don't think it was a tactical change. I think he really made that
                    decision. I think he Was torn. Because Rostow, on the one hand, was telling him
                    all the time that Tet had really been a great triumph from the end of the North
                    Vietnamese effort. But I think he was shaken by this kind of advice from people
                    in whose judgment he necessarily had some confidence, because they'd had a lot
                    of experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were very shortly thereafter made U.N.

                </p>
                <p>BALL: I don't think so. The President and I always got along perfectly. Oddly
                    enough, we never had problems; at least, I was never aware if we had problems.
                    He treated me with great consideration and courtesy all the time. He rather
                    liked the idea that I was reasonably independent in my judgments of things. At
                    least, he knew that I was honest with him and that I wouldn't double-cross him,
                    and loyalty was very big in his vocabulary.</p>

                        be held was taking place. How did it get into that mess about, “”We'll go
                        anywhere, but we won't go to A, B, C, D,” and so on. What was the
                        President's position during that period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: His concern was that, in the first place, he didn't want to give the French
                    the triumph of having Paris chosen, and furthermore he thought De Gaulle might
                    double-cross him. So he resisted even Paris. He resisted Paris.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you convince him that—?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: I didn't convince him. I think that he finally accepted it because the
                    position was an impossible position—that we would go anywhere anytime, but we
                    wouldn't go to Paris, which was an ally.</p>

                <p>To get off of Vietnam, I suppose the best way to get off of it is to ask
                    generally. The critics have always said that one of the great horrors of our
                    Vietnam effort was that it distracted us so badly from everything else. Was the
                    fallout that serious?</p>
                <p>BALL: I think it was. I think it made it very hard to get attention on everything
                    else, that judgments tended to be colored by the Vietnamese situation. For
                    example, we pressed the British so hard to stay in line on Vietnam, and I'm sure
                    we were willing to pay some costs for it we wouldn't have paid otherwise. We did
                    this with other countries in a rather shameless way, I'm afraid. This was one of
                    the arguments you may have noted I was making myself, that we were getting
                    things totally distorted. In fact, I once drew a map for Dean Rusk and said,
                    “This is your map of the world.” I had a tiny United States with an enormous
                    Vietnam lying right off the coast. (Laughter)</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: I don't think so. I had always sort of taken the lead on European policy,
                    and I didn't get much interference on European policy. Mac Bundy was the only
                    fellow that had some independent views. I always suspected and used to accuse
                    him of being a Gaullist, and he had a different appraisal of the General from

                    as that was concerned. During most of the period, he and I sort of fought
                    shoulder-to-shoulder for it. He was in favor of it.</p>

                <p>BALL: We worked very hard on it, We sent teams around. On the fourteenth of
                    January of 1963, which is a date you may remember as having some significance, I
                    met with Chancellor Adenauer. This was the day of De Gaulle's press conference,
                    and I met with Adenauer. I had been in Paris the Friday before, and while this
                    is really not relevant to the Johnson period, it's rather interesting. I had
                    gone over to talk about the question of British entry and see what I could do,
                    and also I had a meeting on the MLF in Bonn. In Paris on the afternoon of the
                    Friday preceding the Monday, which was January 14, I met among other people
                    Couve de Murville, who was then the foreign minister and a very old friend of
                    mine. I had worked with Couve; I had been his lawyer when he was in Washington,
                    and so on.</p>
                <p>I had been told earlier in the week by some friends of mine—a chap who was the
                    editor of Francois, whose name was Georges Gambeau. He had brought a young
                    reporter, correspondent, to my hotel and had the correspondent repeat to me what
                    he had learned in a private press briefing in the Elys�e Palace, which was
                    almost a complete outline of every point that De Gaulle made in his Monday press
                    conference. This was indicated to the correspondents as the line De Gaulle would
                    take. So I repeated this to Couve de Murville. And Couve de Murville said,
                    “Look, George, you've been around a long time. You ought to know better than to
                    believe anything you hear in press circles. There are absolutely no ideas of
                    that kind in this house.”</p>
                <p>That was on Friday. That night Ted Heath came to my hotel at the Plaza. I had a
                    private room where the two of us had dinner. We had a very long dinner, and a
                    lot of wine, and a rather jubilant evening, because he had been doing the same
                    thing; he had been talking to the French government. He was convinced everything
                    was going to be dandy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know what happened? Was there a change?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: No, there was no change, no change at all. De Gaulle had been working on
                    this press conference for a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That confirms your view of De Gaulle to you.</hi>

                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>BALL: It did. And it also caused a lot of mental reservations about my old friend
                    Couve, too. I only mention this because on Monday I met with Adenauer, and
                    Adenauer started first thing in the morning with the meeting by saying, “I
                    should tell you, Mr. Ball, that I had a very bad dream last night, and I'm still
                    suffering from it. I dreamed that tomorrow I am going to have a terrible fight
                    with Mr. Ball, because I am not going to be able to accept any of the things he
                    tells me.” So I said, “Well, Chancellor, why don't you reserve judgment on that
                    until we finish this morning?” I then made the presentation of the MLF and
                    answered all kinds of questions. We went at it all morning. At the end of the
                    morning he said, “Mr. Ball, I want to tell you that that dream which was
                    haunting me this morning has completely dissipated. You've completely persuaded
                    me. You've answered every question. And I am going to announce this afternoon
                    that the Federal Republic is completely in support of the NLF.”</p>
                <p>He gave a lunch then, and he said, “You know, since you're an old friend and
                    since this is a special occasion, I have both of my foreign ministers here. My
                    old one,” and he put his hand on Von Brentano's shoulder. “And my new one,” and
                    he put his hand on [Gerhard] Schroder's shoulder. Of course, they both hated
                    him. The old man was mean. He really was mean.</p>
                <p>So he announced it in the afternoon. Then I had a party at the American Embassy
                    for the members of the German government, and in the middle of the party we got
                    word from the press conference. Yes, the answer is that the MLF Was still very
                    much alive.</p>
                <p>At the Ranch I suspect it was the meeting just before the bombing pause, Bob
                    McNamara and I were still arguing for it. This must have been in—</p>

                <p>BALL: Late 1965.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still wasn't dead then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Still wasn't dead then. As a matter of fact, the President agreed to it
                    then. We were going to go forward. Then it was clear that the French were going
                    to raise hell, and they started an offensive against it. We finally had a
                    meeting in the White House at night in which' McNamara and I made a fight for
                    it. But for the first time in my life I really got very angry at Mac Bundy,
                    because the President started to read a paper that Mac had written which Mac had
                    not sent me in advance. I want to say that Bundy was extremely fair in all of
                    his dealings. We used to have a lot of arguments, but we never had any problems
                    between us. This was the first time, and I think the only time, I ever really
                    got angry at him.</p>

                <p>BALL: Yes. And I felt if he were going to give the President a memorandum with
                    that argument, he should have let me see it and let me have a copy before we got
                    into the meeting. But anyway, that was a very minor thing, and it was, as I
                    said, the only time I ever knew Mac to deviate from being scrupulously fair.</p>

                    not saying for sure he wasn't right. I think a part of it was also that De

                    neutralization talk. Neutralization was, in effect, giving them what they
                    wanted. I went to see De Gaulle during the Kennedy days and had a long talk with
                    him about it. I found myself in the position which is familiar enough with
                    anybody who is working at the business of arguing a brief which didn't represent
                    my own conviction at all and hearing De Gaulle say a lot of things with which I
                    thoroughly agreed, but which I obviously had to try to negate.</p>

                        solemn agreement on NATO indicate that the President wasn't very firm
                        himself in his commitment to NATO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: No, I think the President was very firm. The President was very clear on
                    this, just as he was on the maintenance of troops in Europe, just as he was on
                    the Berlin issue. But I think it was tactical from the President's point of
                    view. I think his feeling [was that] to put himself against De Gaulle given the
                    prestige that De Gaulle had would only enable De Gaulle to claim that there was
                    an argument between France and the United States.</p>
                <p>There was a good deal of merit in the President's basic instinct on this, and
                    that was, France was not a power that was equal to the United States. It was at
                    best a second-rate power. Therefore, for the President to get, as he said, into
                    a “pissing match” with De Gaulle would only serve to build De Gaulle up and to
                    build France up. Therefore, he was inclined to give him a very soft
                    treatment.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the President have any views on what NATO ought to be
                        doing, other than what it was doing, that he pressed hard for?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>BALL: No, I don't believe so. I think he thought NATO served a necessary
                    purpose.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the so-called “bridge-building” programs of the
                        administration? Did that come up as advice to the President which he took,
                        or was that an initiative that he came up with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: No, I think this was advice that he took. There was quite a little
                    agitation for this in the Policy Planning Staff of the State Department, and I
                    think [Zbigniew] Brzezinski had had some influence on this policy and Walt
                    Rostow was interested in this policy. Quite a lot of people were. And I think it
                    was not much more than that. Nothing very much ever came out of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say, was there much substance? There was a
                        lot of rhetoric.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: A lot of rhetoric. But when it came down to a quite simple issue, were we
                    really going to get an East-West trade bill through, for example, there was no
                    particular inclination on the part of the White House to make a fight for
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the quite good-sounding speech, the East-West trade
                        bill speech, I guess, in 1966, was really just about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: I think the President would like to have done it, but he just wasn't
                    prepared to risk the rest of his program in a fight with the Congress. So the
                    thing went up and died. It went up and just sat there.</p>
                <p>This was the trouble. I mean, rhetoric was quite easy on these things, but to
                    turn them into anything very serious was wholly another matter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You have said that any initiative toward East-West
                        improvement that didn't attack the German problem was necessarily
                        incomplete. Was there any presidential inclination to do anything on the
                        German problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>BALL: No, not really. During that whole period we were in what I always regarded
                    as a rather false position, because we were making all these noises about
                    ultimate reunification and so on. As a matter of fact, I wrote this not long ago
                    in a piece I wrote for an Italian foreign affairs magazine which created quite a
                    row in Germany—on the Ostpolitik saying that one of the reasons why the
                    Ostpolitik might get some receptivity on the western side was that it relieved
                    the West from a position of some hypocrisy, that actually none of the western
                    countries would have been prepared to have accepted a unification. Given the
                    present structure of Europe, they would have been as appalled by it as the
                    Russians. De Gaulle actually said that to me. Q: Was that in fact the position
                    of our government during the Johnson Administration, that we would have been
                    appalled.</p>
                <p>BALL: I don't think anybody ever thought of it for the simple reason it was
                    obviously so far off and so remote a possibility. I thought of it in terms of
                    some rational structure for Europe, because I was always making the argument and
                    writing a lot of stuff during the period, that the only hope for the
                    reunification of the German people was within some kind of a larger European
                    framework, that this was the only basis on which it could be acceptable to the
                    rest of the Europeans, either East or West.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the President really pay enough attention to a complex
                        situation like that to master an issue like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: When a specific one was up that required a concrete decision, then the
                    President did his homework, and we got rather searchingly into it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But as far as mastering the general European situation, he

                </p>
                <p>BALL: I think he was rather content to leave it to me.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That speaks well of you.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: As I say, there wasn't anything unless you got a concrete issue like MLF
                    which required a fight with Congress. And let me say the reason the President
                    abandoned me on that was that he didn't think Congress would take it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So it had to do with domestic politics as much as...
                        ?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Far more. Let's say if this was something he could have done without
                    congressional action, he would have done the MLF. I don't have any doubt about
                    that.</p>
                <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's fairly clear-cut then, as to what his motives
                        were.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Yes. But we were in a dilemma with respect to the MLF, because we were
                    never in position to go up and lobby Congress for the MLF, because there was no
                    final White House decision and the President wouldn't let me do it. But at the
                    end of the road when the President was prepared to make a decision there was no
                    preparation in Congress, and therefore he had a sense that Congress wouldn't
                    take it. And it was this dilemma that we weren't able to resolve.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So one predestined the other, then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about issues such as disarmament that are big today?
                        Was the President interested in such things as that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Yes, I think he was very much interested. I don't think he had too much
                    confidence that we'd ever be able to achieve anything, but he desperately wanted
                    to be a peace president. If, for example, there had been any kind of a signal
                    such as President Kennedy got with regard to a partial test ban treaty, I think
                    the President would have been absolutely delighted to have gone full ahead.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: They climaxed after I left the department. I was never an enthusiast for
                    them, because I thought. As a matter of fact, I did a piece in a book I wrote,
                    about the NPT, which was rather unorthodox.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the President ever take a personal interference or

                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>BALL: Oh, yes, from time to time. But, again, when there was something he had to
                    decide, and so much of the disarmament stuff never required that kind of a
                    top-level decision.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: Well, it was there, and the President was very disturbed about the balance
                    of payments, just as President Kennedy had been. It was never quite the same
                    almost “King Charles' head” that it was for President Kennedy. That, I think,
                    related in large part to what his father was saying, because on at least a
                    couple of occasions when I would make a rather eloquent speech, or what I
                    thought was an eloquent speech, to President Kennedy about the fact that we were
                    distorting policy in a very false way to try to accommodate it to the balance of
                    payments which wasn't all that important—I would try to explain to him why I
                    thought it wasn't all that important—he would say, “All right, George. I
                    understand you, but how will I ever explain that to my father?”</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: I must say I always tried to get any decisions on the balance of payments
                    to the extent I could influence the situation during the winter months when the
                    President wouldn't be going up to Hyannis Port. Every weekend he went up to
                    Hyannis Port he came back absolutely obsessed with the balance of payments.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was Johnson that obsessed with the issue?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: He was concerned, but he wasn't.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: Yes. It got worse. And this was a situation where McNamara got deeply upset
                    about it, too. Because Bob was prepared to distort any kind of policy in order
                    to achieve some temporary alleviation to the balance of payments, which again to
                    my mind was a function of his preoccupation with quantification.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right. That's something that could be quantified,

                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>BALL: That could be quantified. For example, I think he seriously proposed—and he
                    may actually have done it on “buy American” issues—that if the American goods
                    didn't cost more than 165 per cent of what it would cost abroad, we bought it in
                    the United States. You know, this is the most horrible misapplication of
                    resources)</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: Oh, yes, He would go along with Bob. In other words, they were willing to
                    take a great deal of punishment on the budget in order to help the balance of
                    payments.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the trade issues? Was the President interested
                        in...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: On the trade issues, the President was generally good. There's no point in
                    making any comparison with President Kennedy, because we had rather different
                    issues come up. But then there would come something very specific like the Beef
                    Import Bill. I spent any amount of time on the Beef Import Bill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was a Texas issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: That was a Texas issue, and he was getting heat very directly on that. He
                    didn't care how I settled it. I don't think he really cared whether anything was
                    done for the beef interests, but I had to quiet them down somehow. So we finally
                    got a bill through that was just about as meaningless as it could be. This was a
                    triumph of my young friend Tom Ehrlich because I turned the negotiations of the
                    cattle interests over to Ehrlich and he did an extraordinary job. And they only
                    realized afterwards what had happened to them.</p>

                <p>One of your crisis points in European affairs, I call it European, was the Cyprus
                    episode in 1964.</p>
                <p>BALL: The Cyprus thing was my issue in a funny way, because when the matter first
                    came up, when David Harlech, whom I'm seeing this afternoon actually, came to
                    call on the Secretary to explain that the British were going to get out of
                    Cyprus, I was there and said to Dean, “Look, I'll take this one. Don't worry
                    about it.” So from then on, I handled Cyprus almost singlehandedly.</p>

                <p>BALL: Oh, yes, he was quite satisfied with it. And I got wonderful support from

                    I went to see Makarios and Inonu and Papandreou, it was just a terribly
                    precarious thing, and I had a feeling that Inonu and Papandreou each had to be
                    given terribly tough treatment by the President if we ever were going to get any
                    kind of a settlement. Oh, no, this was a different occasion. No, this was a
                    later trip, when I stopped the bombing, or something out there. I hadn't gone to
                    see Makarios on this trip. I had been to see Inonu and Papandreou, that's
                    right.</p>

                    from Ankara. I had one of these converted tankers—what we call a McNamara kit.
                    It was perfectly comfortable. Anyway, it was better than Air Force One because I
                    could always get a bed not only for myself but for my staff. This day we didn't
                    need a bed, because I started dictating when we left Ankara—I had two
                    secretaries on board—and I had finished this memorandum just an hour out of
                    Washington. I was met at the plane by someone from the White House saying, “The
                    President wants you to come immediately.”</p>
                <p>I was able to go see the President and hand him a memorandum, saying, “This
                    summarizes everything I can tell you, Mr. President.” Among other things, that
                    the President must immediately invite Inonu and Papandreou for separate visits.
                    Which he then immediately agreed to do. We had them over there within a
                    week.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did he perform with them? Did he do what you wanted
                        him to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: He did what I wanted him to do very well. The President was very, very
                    cooperative on this kind of thing. If he were convinced that I knew what I was
                    talking about, and he was willing to give me the benefit of the doubt, and I
                    felt that something was necessary, he'd do it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Even if it involved a tough session with a chief of

                <p>BALL: Oh, sure, a couple of tough sessions in this case and disarranging all his

                </p>
                <p>BALL: Throughout this period there was the general question as to how we would
                    deal with the British and the French on the effect of the British entry. Of
                    course, after the De Gaulle veto in July of 1963, it hadn't been as acute as it
                    had been in Kennedy's day. Kennedy had pretty much let me handle all of this
                    myself, and Rusk, too. They weren't as interested in it as I was. I was very
                    much interested, and again I had complete support.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now we're coming up to 1971. It had been eight years, and
                        now we seem to be getting to a point where we might finally succeed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>How much did you get into crisis situations such as, say, the Dominican Republic
                    intervention in 1965?</p>
                <p>BALL: In every one of them. On the Dominican Republic, I was with the President
                    when we made the decision to send the troops in. I had gone over to see the
                    President about something. I guess it was the Dominican Republic. There was a
                    little tiny office right off the Oval Office, just half as big as this room. And
                    the President, Mac Bundy, and I were there. I can't recall whether anyone else
                    was there-maybe McNamara, I'm not sure-when we got the telegrams in from the
                    Dominican Republic about the five hundred Americans, or whatever it was, who
                    were there in the parking lot next to the Hotel Ambassador, or whatever it was,
                    and were in imminent danger of being killed. So we made an instant decision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Based entirely on the need to—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Based entirely on the need. Nothing else at that time. Now what happened
                    was that this was a kind of slowly growing and developing affair, and it got
                    rather transformed. After the troops got down there, and particularly after we
                    began to-I don't know, we sent something like twenty thousand down. But there is
                    absolutely no doubt whatever that the initial decision was made with only one
                    consideration in mind, and that was a consideration which any head of state
                    would have been derelict if he hadn't responded to: that we damned well had to
                    get some troops in there in one hell of a hurry or our people would have been
                    killed. Now, whether they in fact would have been killed is another matter. But
                    let me say that on all the evidence we had before us at that time, this was the
                    only conclusion we could come to. So I have no apologies whatever for that
                    initial sending of the troops in.</p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>On the question as to whether we should have sent in such a mass of troops and
                    whether we should have so obviously then come out against a communist takeover,
                    I think again you have to read this in terms of American domestic politics at
                    the time. The clamor that if we had permitted the Dominican Republic to become
                    another Cuba, which was the thing that was on the President's mind, I think it
                    would have been devastating. I think this very deeply concerned the President;
                    that, plus the fact that he was getting a lot of what I thought were highly
                    dubious reports from J. Edgar Hoover about the number of communists.</p>
                <p>But then the thing got taken out of everybody's hands. The President became the
                    desk officer on the thing. He ran everything himself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Is that because it was in Latin America? Was it true that
                        he felt differently about Central America, South America...?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: He felt much more familiar with them. After all, a Texan has a feeling for
                    Latin America. I think he felt that this was something right off the coast, that
                    his own position was very much at stake on this issue of whether we had another
                    Cuba on our hands or not. So he moved in, made every decision and did
                    everything.</p>
                <p>There's one thing again that I don't think has ever been printed, and that was
                    the activities of Abe Fortas in this situation, because Abe Fortas had gone down
                    under an assumed name to try to persuade... You see, in the days when he was
                    under secretary of interior and when he began to practice law, he had a great
                    friendship with Mu�oz Marin, and through that friendship he had gotten to know
                    Bosch and these other people. Bosch at that time was in Puerto Rico. He was down
                    under an assumed name negotiating with Bosch for a period of ten days maybe.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: That's right. And telephoning the President always that, “This is Mr.
                    Martin calling,” or something of the sort. This went on.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: Yes, I was engaged in it through the Bundy-Vance mission. I must say I
                    began to lose interest in it after a time. I played a role in getting Ellsworth
                    Bunker into the thing. I think Bunker was my original suggestion; quite frankly,
                    I don't think anybody but Bunker could ever have worked it out. It cost him a
                    year of his life down there.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: He just wasn't going to let the communist government run the country,
                    that's all.</p>
                <p>

                <p>BALL: He would have taken anybody who was non-communist. I met with Balaguer
                    myself secretly in New York on a couple of occasions at the Waldorf-Astoria
                    during this period.</p>

                <p>BALL: He and Vance went down and Tom Mann went down. Tom had a very simple
                    solution to all these problems, which put the army in control.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: Yes. Tom's basic philosophy with regard to Latin America was that the only
                    group you could count on, who had any continuity, and the only stable element of
                    the society was the military. So that you always found the right military and

                        called him, the desk officer for the thing, did he keep those of you in the

                        that you didn't know about that he was pursuing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: No. I think we knew about everything. We went to a thousand meetings over
                    there. We'd get down into the minutiae, really the minutiae, and the President
                    would preside and handle everything. It put us all—it put me in a position where
                    I just practically lost interest. I had a lot of other things to do, and I tried
                    to avoid the Dominican Republic as much as I could.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: Not when the President immerses himself in the way he did at that time.
                    This became a thing of such passion, almost an obsession.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did it affect adversely so many of the people like
                        Fulbright, for example, when it came out reasonably well?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: They didn't know the end of the story then. One of Bill Fulbright's great
                    disabilities was that he read books. Nobody in the Senate should read books.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Don't worry. I don't think very many can be accused of
                        that crime.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: He had read books with a very strong anti-colonialist bias. One of them
                    that he talked to me about a great deal which affected him very much was a book
                    by a woman named Han Su Yen called The Crippled Tree, which was a book about
                    China and the negotiations over the treaty ports. So he was always reading
                    something that indicated the anti-colonialist bias, and he was preoccupied with
                    what appeared to him to be a kind of recrudescence of American imperialism,
                    almost like the 1890s.</p>

                <p>The Dominican Republic had some rather special meaning for quite a lot of people,
                    because, after all, we had had Marines down there for a long, long time. I think
                    this was Bill's reaction, and I think it was an honest reaction. I think it was
                    impossible that he and Lyndon Johnson could over a period of time ever have
                    gotten along very well.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: Fundamentally on any issues. I'll tell you a story, too. I don't know if
                    this is a good one to postpone for the ten-year requirement or not. In 1952
                    right after the presidential election when Eisenhower came in I got a call from
                    Bill Fulbright or I went up to see him for something; I can't remember. He was
                    in despair because he said, without anybody knowing about it this young fellow
                    Lyndon Johnson had been lobbying the Senate and had got the votes to be the
                    leader. All of Fulbright's friends were appalled by this, including Bill
                    himself. They wanted somebody much more liberal and so on. He was deeply
                    upset.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So the seeds go back a ways.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Well, it just indicated a kind of incompatibility. These weren't the same
                    kind of people. Fulbright thought of himself as an intellectual. He was a man
                    who was interested in ideas; he wasn't interested in politics per se. So they
                    were incompatible.</p>

                        were there more reasons?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: No, I had a kind of developing feeling that Vietnam was consuming
                    everything. This was no act of conscience on my part. I had no intention
                    whatever of going out and denouncing my colleagues. I've just never worked with
                    people on that basis. I was physically terribly tired.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: And I had a feeling that we were all outstaying our time. The basis on
                    which Rusk and I worked was that Sunday was like any other day. We never took a
                    break. I had four telephones by my bed. There was hardly a week went by that I
                    wasn't called at least once in the middle of the night on some crisis. More
                    often than not, I had to make a decision as to whether this was worth bothering
                    the President or not.</p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>I had a very early experience with President Johnson soon after he came in. We
                    had a crisis in Brazil—it was the time that Goulart was being thrown out—I had a
                    strong representation in. At three o'clock in the morning I was down at the
                    department, which was normal in any crisis. Rusk was away somewhere. As I
                    mentioned, crises always seemed to occur when I was acting secretary. I don't
                    know why. Finally, on the strong urging of our ambassador down there who
                    was—</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Lincoln Gordon at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Yes. I sent a telegram or issued a statement which had the effect of, in
                    effect, recognizing the new government. Goulart wasn't quite out of the country,
                    and I was taking a chance. But it worked out beautifully and was very effective.
                    It was the kind of thing that marked a period to the end of Mr. Goulart.</p>
                <p>But the President was furious with me, the only time he was ever really angry
                    with me, I think. Why hadn't I let him know? Why did I do this without letting
                    him know? I said, “It was three o'clock in the morning, Mr. President.” He said,
                    “Don't ever do that again. I don't care what hour in the morning it is, I want
                    to know. I'm not saying that what you did wasn't right, but after this I want to
                    know.” Thereafter I never hesitated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that lead to him getting bothered by a lot of things
                        that he shouldn't be bothered with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: I don't think so, not in his judgment. So I would call him. I never
                    hesitated to call him. I'd call him at two, three, four o'clock in the morning,
                    ask them if they'd wake up the President, I had something I wanted to talk to
                    him about. He'd always say, “Yes, George, what's the problem?” And I would
                    outline it. He would always say, “Well, what do you think we ought to do?” And I
                    would always say, “What I propose to do with your approval, Mr. President, is
                    the following.” There was never once that he failed to say, “That seems about
                    right to me. Go right ahead, and I can't tell you how grateful I am to you for
                    calling me.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sometimes he was known to get angry at people who
                        announced that they were departing. Was there any of that in your case?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: No, I don't think so. I was very frank with him. I just told him that I
                    really had to go back and repair my fortunes, that I had been away from my
                    professional activity too long. At that time I expected to go back and practice
                    law. And II said] that I was physically tired and I felt that it was time for a
                    change in the guard, as far as I was concerned.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he contact you frequently during the period you were
                        out of government, between then and 1968? I know you were called in for the
                        Pueblo.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: The Pueblo, and, actually, the time that the Six Day War started. I was in
                    Chicago making a speech and I was awakened early in the morning by Walt Rostow
                    saying, “Do you know there's a war on, and the President would like you to come
                    right down.” I said, “I've got a speech today, and if I cancel it, what will the
                    appearance be?” He consulted the President and said, “Maybe you'd better not do
                    it then.” So I didn't get down. Mac Bundy did get down and got stuck for two
                    weeks, so I was glad I hadn't [gone].</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't then go afterwards?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: No. It was for a particular meeting. If I had gone down, it was reasonably
                    possible I would have been stuck for a continued time, which I didn't
                    particularly welcome.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What did he use you for in the Pueblo incident?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: I headed a group, a little committee which we got together, composed of
                    General Mark Clark, Admiral David McDonald who had been chief of naval
                    operations, and General Larry Kuter, an air force general—he was the vice
                    chairman of Pan American Airlines. We examined all of the evidence on what had
                    happened to the Pueblo and came up with a series of recommendations for the
                    President.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which he followed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: I think so. By and large, they were carried out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your recommendations were basically that we not do
                        anything drastic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: That's right, and, also, they related to the conduct of these operations in
                    the future.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The surveillance thing that had led to the Pueblo
                        trouble?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you left your job as U.N. ambassador to go to work
                        for Mr. Humphrey, you made it quite clear the reasons that you did so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: I telephoned the President. I had been thinking about this. I took a trip
                    to Europe and had the impression over there that Mr. Nixon was going to be
                    elected. My attitude toward Mr. Nixon had been formed at a time when I was
                    working with my friend Mr. Stevenson back in 1952, and I had rather
                    strongly-held views, as you may recall. No, I just decided that Humphrey was
                    going to be badly beaten. Humphrey was a good friend of mine, although I'm not
                    sure that he would have been the man among all men I would have picked as the
                    candidate, but he was a man of great honesty and a terribly fine human being. I
                    thought it was tragic that he was being put in an impossible position. I thought
                    he was going to lose and lose very badly, but I had a feeling that too
                    shattering a defeat would have hurt the party and would install Mr. Nixon with
                    too great a mandate.</p>
                <p>So I made a decision in my own mind that not only was I going to quit, but I was
                    going to be quite outrageous and see if I could contribute to reversing this
                    trend. I had a feeling that Humphrey immediately thereafter had to do something
                    fairly decisive with regard to Vietnam.</p>
                <p>I telephoned the President down on the Ranch. I said, “Mr. President, for the
                    first time in my life I am in a position not of asking your advice, but of
                    telling you what I'm going to do, because this is a matter of conscience with
                    me. I've come to a decisions after a great deal of conscience with me. I've come
                    to a decision after a great deal of soul searching that I'm going to resign.”
                    And so on. “I would hope I would have your blessing on this, and I would
                    certainly want to do it in a way that would create the least problems for
                    you.”</p>
                <p>He was very nice about it and said “All right.” Then he called me back a little
                    later and expressed deep concern. Very often his delayed reaction was somewhat
                    different from his first one, which is true of everybody. He expressed concern
                    that it looked as though we were being very erratic, that I was just coming in
                    and then going out again. But he didn't make any real effort to dissuade me. He
                    did ask me to hold off for a couple of days, because he wanted to be able to
                    announce my successor at the time he announced my resignation.</p>
                <p>So on the basis of this, even though I hadn't gotten the final clearance about
                    this, I telephoned Humphrey, who had known nothing about this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is not worked out with the candidate in advance?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>BALL: It wasn't worked out with the candidate. I said, “Hubert, I'll tell you
                    what I'm going to do. I'm going to do this; I'm going to declare for you, and
                    I'm going to go to work. What I intend to do is to be very outrageous. I want to
                    make a very strong attack on Mr. Nixon. I think I can command the television and
                    newspaper attention for about three days, and maybe we can help deflect this
                    thing.” So that's the way it worked out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you tell Mr. Johnson that you were going to strongly
                        push Humphrey in the direction of some change on Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: No, I did not. I read him the statement I proposed to make, which announced
                    something about qualities which Mr. Nixon manifestly does not possess, or
                    something which indicated I wasn't going to be an easy fellow to get along
                    with.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why did it take so long to get Humphrey to make a more
                        forthright statement on Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: He was terribly confused. Then he was getting lousy advice. One of the
                    problems that Humphrey had was that he had a lot of really second-rate people
                    around him. It's almost implicit in the job of vice president that he can't get
                    good staff because he really has nothing important to do, and first-rate people
                    aren't going to spend their time with the vice president. And [Humphrey] may
                    have had the same problem, I don't know.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he emerged as a candidate so late.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: He emerged as a candidate so late that he just went with the people he had
                    with him, which was normal and he's very loyal, more loyal to them than they
                    were to him.</p>
                <p>So this was what occurred. I said I had a speech already arranged. “I want to fly
                    out and join you.” I flew out and joined him, I think in Seattle. I said, “We've
                    got to get to work on a speech on Vietnam.” A draft had been prepared which I
                    thought was hopeless. I flew back to New York because I had a television
                    appearance there on “Face the Nation,” or “Meet the Press,” or one of those
                    damned things. We wrote it en route and took it back out. In the meantime there
                    had been some other rewriting, and we put all of these things together in what
                    was the Salt Lake City speech. It finally came down to how strong the language
                    would be, and Larry O'Brien put it up to me, and I made the final decision on
                    just what the critical language was.</p>
                <p>Then Humphrey said that he would call the President and would I call him right
                    after he had called him. I said, “Yes.” Then I got a word from the television
                    station that “the Vice President has not been able to speak to the President,
                    because he has had to do a retake of his television because he didn't like the
                    first take,” and would I call President Johnson and tell him.</p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>So I telephoned the President. The operators—of course, I knew the White House
                    operators very well—said, “Mr. Secretary,” or Mr. Ambassador, whatever they
                    called me, “the President is talking to Mr. Nixon and as soon as he's off, I'll
                    put you through. And it was half an hour later. (Laughter)</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How strong was the President's presence in the Humphrey
                        campaign, as far as holding the line on the policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: He did his best; that was made known down the line when he changed it all.
                    As a matter of fact, the President's reaction to what I said on the passage I
                    read him was, “Now, can't we make it clear that that's no change in policy?”
                    Which was, of course, exactly the opposite of what we were trying to
                    achieve.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's right. Did that seriously hinder? After all,
                        Humphrey did come fairly close.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Look, from then on that broke the thing. I mean the combination. I don't
                    know how much my quitting did, although I think it had something to do with it.
                    It was a dramatic event on a forty-eight hour basis, plus this Salt Lake City
                    speech immediately thereafter. From then on the curve was up. We were down
                    seventeen points on the Harris Poll.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the President hinder the campaign in any way, or help
                        it in any way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: What hindered it was the pulling and hauling over getting to Paris. With a
                    little more flexibility two weeks before the election, then we could have gotten
                    the negotiating talks started.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What delayed that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Rigidity at the top of the government, plus a terrible resistance on the
                    part of the Embassy in Saigon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not a conscious effort on the part of the President to
                        keep it out of the campaign.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: No, I must say I think that the President's attitude was, one, a great
                    reluctance to appear to have been manipulating the thing so that it broke just
                    before the election, because he wanted to make clear for history that he was not
                    using Vietnam for political reasons.</p>

                </p>
                <p>BALL: I saw him, yes, sure. We went down for a dinner for Dean Rusk, and he
                    delivered a eulogy of me—the President did—and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No disruption in your friendship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>BALL: Never has been. I was down there in Austin the other day and the President
                    couldn't have been nicer. He just wrote me a terribly warm note. I'm very fond
                    of the President. I have great respect for him. I think he is a man of great,
                    great qualities, and it was tragic that the Vietnamese war is the thing that his
                    administration is likely to be known by, because he did magnificent things, and
                    he had a great vision of the United States.</p>
