                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is tape one, side one of an interview with Janey
                        Cole. Were you born with the name Janey?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Janey was my baptized name. J-A-N-E-Y.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: J-A-N-E-Y. C-O-L-E?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Middle initial?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Middle initial is Dea. D-E-A.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay. When and where were you born?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: I was born in 1944 in Brooklyn, New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you tell me something about your family? First, on
                        your father's side and then your mother's side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Both my parents were originally Canadians from the Ottawa Valley. My father
                    eventually became an American citizen. My mother did not because she liked to
                    announce that if you crazy Americans did X, Y or Z she was going to go back to
                    Canada. “Elect George Wallace President” was one of her favorites, I remember. I
                    grew up in Brooklyn. My father worked for the American Can Company. He was a
                    draftsman and a sort of a functional engineer and supervisor.</p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you know anything about the Coles from Canada? Where
                        did they come from, what they were doing, how long they'd been there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Oh, they'd been there a long time and they were originally of English
                    extraction. They were people who ran small businesses. My Grandfather Cole, whom
                    I never met, apparently ran a plumbing concern along with a colleague of his. My
                    mother's family were frontiers people. They had helped to settle large parts of
                    eastern and Upper Canada; they were lumbermen, agriculturalists, and park
                    rangers. My step-grandfather on my mother's side was one of the legendary park
                    rangers of Algonquin National Park who have been written about quite a bit and
                    I've seen his name in books.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did your mother and father meet?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: My mother grew up in a small village called Whitby in Ontario, Canada. It
                    had no school beyond the eighth grade and the custom was to send the children to
                    Ottawa after eighth grade for further education. So my mother was in Ottawa, had
                    finished high school, and was going to business college, and she met my father.
                    He wanted to seek his fortune in the United States so they came here in the late
                    1920s or early 1930s. And despite the Depression they did all right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have brothers or sisters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: No. I was an only child. I came along toward the end of the war in 1944. I
                    think I really surprised them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about as a kid growing up in Brooklyn?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: I grew up in a neighborhood called Bay Ridge where today the Verrazano
                    Bridge comes down connecting Staten Island and Brooklyn. But in those days we
                    spent a lot of time taking the ferry to Staten Island and then the Staten Island
                    ferry to Manhattan to get around. And at that time, although my family is Irish,
                    it was largely a Scandinavian neighborhood. It's now changed, it's got different
                    kinds of people in it now, but then it was largely Scandinavian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how about as a kid? What did you do? You always
                        think of Brooklyn kids playing stickball in the street or what have
                        you.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>COLE: We played a game called Kings, you bounced a ball off of the front steps of
                    the stoop of a house or off of the side of a building. I remember all the little
                    girls in my neighborhood went to dancing school, as did I. George Balanchine of
                    the New York City Ballet was very much in our minds.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see the movie The Red Shoes?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Many of the children did. I don't remember seeing it perhaps because by
                    that time the ballerina had contracted polio, which was endemic in Brooklyn at
                    that time, it was very disturbing for my family.</p>
                <p>We also used to take the ferry boat over to Staten Island to go horseback riding,
                    another favorite pastime. I was very active in the Girl Scouts and went away to
                    Girl Scout camp every summer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were did you go to school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: I went to P.S. 102, Public School 102 which went up to the eighth
                    grade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Oh, it was just fine. From there I went to Hunter College High School in
                    Manhattan. This was one of the New York City's specialized high schools. Hunter
                    was academic and all girls; you had to pass an exam to be admitted.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any favorite subjects in elementary
                        school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: In order to graduate from eighth grade we had to pass a test in the U.S.
                    Constitution; I particularly enjoyed that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about reading? Were you much of a reader?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes, all the time. I can remember my friends all read The Black Stallion
                    series. There was also a group of girls who all read Nancy Drew. I could never
                    quite get the hang of Nancy Drew, but I read some of them so I could talk to my
                    girlfriends. Mostly I preferred to read dog stories, you know.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Albert Payson Terhune.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes, yes, absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when, how about at home? Did you mother and father
                        talk much about politics or the Cold War around the dinner table when you
                        were growing up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Not a whole lot. However, elections and voting were very important. My
                    mother, even though she was a Canadian citizen would debate with my father and
                    it was always a big question over how he would vote. Before we had a primary
                    system the decision was actually made at the convention. We used to go down to
                    the Jersey Shore in the summertime, and we would be absolutely glued to our
                    radios, listening to what Adlai Stevenson had to say. My mother was a great
                    admirer of Stevenson and my father didn't like him so there would be long,
                    intense political discussions. It was in this connection that foreign policy
                    issues would be raised in the house. And to this day I watch political
                    conventions even though I know things are not resolved in them anymore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did your parents fall on the liberal/conservative
                        spectrum?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: I remember that my mother thought that Nixon was quite the best candidate.
                    And I think they both liked the fact that he seemed to be protecting Quemoy and
                    Matsu and they thought he had a good brain and he was going to be able to deal
                    with the Chinese communists properly. They were more inclined towards Nixon than
                    to Kennedy, whom they saw as being relatively untried in foreign policy. And I
                    also think that they had some concerns about his Catholicism. Although they were
                    uncomfortable admitting it, they thought that Catholic dogma would determine
                    where he would stand and he would be compelled by his religion to try to impose
                    certain things upon the American people. I was a very little girl when Jackie
                    Robinson integrated the Brooklyn Dodgers, you know, and one of the very early
                    things I can remember as a child was my father throwing somebody out of the
                    house, telling them to get out, because they used the mean word to describe
                    Jackie Robinson.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, when you went to Hunter College High School,
                        what was that like? You say it was a selective school?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>COLE: It was. We used to joke that it was for the intellectually twisted, but
                    actually it was for the intellectually gifted. It drew not from one district but
                    from all over the city. It was racially and ethnically very much integrated
                    although predominantly Jewish at that time. And it was intellectually very
                    rigorous. When I went on to college I found that pretty much my first two years
                    of college I could have skipped. I walked out of my senior year of high school
                    knowing this stuff.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you had much contact with the Jewish culture in
                        elementary school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Only occasionally. There was a synagogue in our neighborhood which always
                    had a Girl Scout troop, and since Girl Scouts was a big thing in my community we
                    interacted with those girls. And I had some classmates who were Jewish. At the
                    time, I think, the tendency was not to talk about differences but to focus on
                    things that were shared. Nonetheless, I knew about Passover and I knew about
                    Rosh Hashanah and I knew about Yom Kippur and I knew that it was nice to be
                    invited to a Seder, or to come in and watch Mrs. Cohen light her candles. And I
                    also knew that my Jewish friends liked being invited down on Christmas day to
                    see the Christmas tree and eat some of our specialties. So we saw our
                    celebrations as one in a spectrum.</p>
                <p>When I went to high school I discovered Chinese New Year because I had a
                    girlfriend who was Chinese-American.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Hunter specialize in anything?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Well, Hunter College High School was very, very good at science and math
                    but, probably because it was all female, there was a thrust toward language and
                    literature. I studied both French and Latin; other people studied even more
                    languages. Our English courses were quite advanced. When I got to college I
                    found I didn't really have to read very much because I'd already done it; for
                    example, we read Beowulf in the ninth grade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, today everything's gone co-ed but there is another
                        side that says separating the boys from the girls is actually a good thing.
                        I went to an all male prep school, and looking back on it I think it
                        probably worked out fairly well; it cut out a lot of the nonsense.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Though you probably weren't very happy with it at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I detested it. But the point being that it actually,
                        looking back on it, I think it allowed more concentration. And I think
                        there's even more talk today about guys sort of elbowing girls aside, you
                        know, in answering questions.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>COLE: And those mean girls, boy, oh, boy, they jacked the boys around, too.</p>
                <p>You know, at the time I thought it was a very bad idea because we were going to
                    go out into a co-ed world. We were going to go out into a workplace where there
                    were both men and women; we were going to function in societies that weren't
                    single sex. And we weren't learning how to function that way in high school.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, we were gaining a lot of intellectual and academic skills that
                    stayed with us. So maybe, maybe it was okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, the jury's out and will never come in on
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: And there were lots of other areas to interact with people of the other
                    gender. My church had a very active social group to which I belonged. There were
                    certainly boys around so it wasn't as if we never saw any. And we had events
                    with our brother schools, Brooklyn Tech and Stuyvesant.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any favorite courses?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: I was always good at history and became a history major in college. And
                    literature; I always thought I was an English major manqu�.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did your reading change? I mean, were you sort of hooked
                        on the book-of-the-month club and all that or were you other books or
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: No. I can remember reading enormous quantities of Dostoyevsky. You know,
                    it's great for teenage melodrama, but you get some great, classy ways of
                    expressing it. I remember The Brothers Karamazov was probably my favorite novel
                    of all time. And the nice thing about Hunter College High School was that it was
                    not considered extraordinary to like Dostoyevsky.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the time you were going to Hunter, did you feel that as
                        a woman you would have a career or were you going to go on and get an M-R-S
                        Degree?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>COLE: My family was just ferociously ambitious for me, and it was very much in
                    the atmosphere that you had to prepare for the world of work. My parents wanted
                    me to be thinking in terms of a career, and meanwhile do my homework, to be off
                    to my ballet classes, and go to the library. So they were definitely pushing. My
                    mother often spoke in disparaging terms of girls who were, quote,
                    “domesticated.” Actually, I really didn't learn to cook until I went away to
                    college. And then it was a boyfriend of mine who said, “Oh, I'll show you how to
                    make fried chicken. It's really easy. Even I can do it. You can do it.” So,
                    that's how I learned how to cook.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any sort of career in mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: No, I don't think so. I think we were expected to be more open ended at
                    that age. Of course, adults used to like to ask what we wanted to be when we
                    grew up because we had cute little answers. And I think I always said a
                    ballerina because I was very impressed with Maria Tallchief at the time. But I
                    think that we were supposed to be getting basic basis of skills and then going
                    on from there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about world events? Were you listening to news on the
                        radio, TV or reading The New York Times when you were in high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: We had a television when I was in elementary school so we were catching the
                    news on TV and my parents read the popular press. I can remember, sometime
                    around the seventh or eighth grade, getting interested in the fall of
                    governments. I was fascinated by how the French or the Italians could go through
                    so many governments, how did that work. And I must say I didn't really
                    understand it until thousands of years later. And I can remember we were hearing
                    about the war in Vietnam and about how our soldiers were over there working with
                    the Vietnamese and the Laotians or the Cambodians and wondering where these
                    places were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From Hunter High School, were you being pushed toward
                        Hunter College?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Well, Hunter High School was then located right next to Hunter College
                    which was also a New York City public school, and the high school had originally
                    been founded as a sort of a lab school in which students majoring in education
                    at Hunter College could practice their skills. But we were not particularly
                    pointed toward Hunter College.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hunter College at that time was all female, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes, it was. It was.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One other thing before we move on, how about the movies?
                        Did they have much of an influence? And were you a moviegoer or a
                        playgoer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: The very first movie I went to as I was a child was in Ottawa visiting my
                    paternal grandmother. At that point the Canadians had absolutely no air
                    conditioning and of course, no fans because it never got hot. Well, it certainly
                    did get hot. So my mother said, “Let's get dressed up and go to the movies.” So
                    I was a very little girl holding her hand, wearing a little frock with
                    embroidery on it and we went off to see Fantasia which I just remember as one of
                    the best movies I ever saw in my whole wide life. And for the rest of my life I
                    loved animation. I still love animation, and my friends kid me. They say, “Oh,
                    if there's one person who's going to have seen Shrek or Finding Nemo it's going
                    to be Janey. And that's true, I do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about being within striking distance of Broadway? Did
                        you get to see plays?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Oh, yes. But again, there was this idea of what was suitable for children.
                    For example, my mother took me to see The King and I when I was a very little
                    girl. I had never been allowed to read Uncle Tom's Cabin because me mother
                    thought it was patronizing towards people of color. So in the middle of the
                    scene where Uncle Tom's Cabin is re-enacted, in a ringing voice, I inquired of
                    my mother what this was all about and I had to be shushed.</p>
                <p>And the other thing I remember vividly that certainly influenced me for the rest
                    of my life was the ballet. We used to go see George Balanchine's New York City
                    Ballet, at that time at City Center. Maria Tallchief dancing in Firebird was one
                    of the high points of my young life. But I was very young and I saw only part of
                    the program because I was thought to be too young to sit through a whole
                    afternoon of ballet.</p>
                <p>One other thing I should also mention in theatre was Joseph Papp's free
                    Shakespeare in Central Park which was a very important part of my life in high
                    school. Everybody expected that we'd see the plays. And it was something of a
                    struggle because I lived in Brooklyn and you left the Central Park theatre very
                    late at night; there were all sorts of policemen lined up to get you out of the
                    park safely; and then you had to get on the subway and take this long, long ride
                    back to Brooklyn. But at any rate, we did it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, one of the things too at that time was that
                        essentially the streets were relatively safe and you used to go anywhere.
                        You wanted to go somewhere you just went.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>COLE: Well, we were certainly rigorously reminded not to talk to strangers. And
                    anytime there was some dreadful incident involving a child and some pedophile we
                    were warned that this could happen to you. And I can remember the story of a
                    little classmate of mine who was stopped by a man who said he was trying to find
                    such and such an address. So she took him there and then he wanted to know,
                    where to find such and such a person in the apartment house. She said, go over
                    and look at the names on the mail boxes. And she showed him where they were. And
                    he turned out to be someone who wanted to take advantage, sort of catching her
                    in that dark corner. Fortunately she was a quick child and ran away. But my
                    mother said, it was alright for her to show him where the building was but she
                    should never have gone in with him. You know, that you don't do. So there was a
                    lot of time and attention given to keeping us safe that way.</p>
                <p>But you're right, you know. I used to walk a mile down to the Staten Island
                    ferry, ride a bus for another 45 minutes, and walk another half-mile, all by
                    myself when I was nine years old, to go horseback riding. I did it every week.
                    Later, I would walk to the subway and ride for an hour to get to high school
                    through the morning rush hour. I did have some bad experiences but you were
                    supposed to learn how to handle that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you thinking about with respect to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Ninety eight percent of the students at my high school did indeed go to
                    college. I remember two girls who did not, one because she chose to get married
                    and the other because of her particular career interests. So the emphasis was on
                    finding a college that fitter your circumstances financially. If you needed a
                    scholarship as I did, that was a major consideration. I wanted very much to go
                    to a co-ed school and I also thought it would be nice to get out of New York
                    City and see something different.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So while you were in high school did you feel the pressure
                        of competition from the large Jewish population of selective New York
                        schools, the same way I think that today in California if you have a lot of
                        Orientals in your class you feel the competition because these are cultures
                        that really push their kids. Did you feel that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: You sure did. When I got to college I was surprised that people weren't
                    studying. I don't think they understood what a gift their education was. Neither
                    of my parents had been to college. My father went and apprenticed himself as a
                    draftsman. There was a lot of pressure to succeed and to take yourself seriously
                    and to compete. And maybe to some extent success was beating the other fellow
                    although, you know, some people would beat you in math and other people would
                    beat you here and you would succeed in this. There was a lot of range in which
                    you could succeed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to college?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: I went to a small school in upstate New York where I had a scholarship. It
                    was called Hartwick College; it was located in Oneonta, New York. And it was a
                    beautiful place, it was God's country but it was very cold and the experience
                    made it abundantly clear to me that I was a city girl. It had been established
                    as a Lutheran seminary to train missionaries in the 1700s and 1800s to preach to
                    Native Americans and still had a Lutheran connection. Most of the students came
                    from upstate New York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: 1962 to 1966.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel you were out of place or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: One of the nice things that my high school did for me was imbue me with an
                    awful lot of self-confidence which other people, I think, perceived as arrogance
                    or self-importance. I just thought, I was quite convinced they were wrong and I
                    was right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find that it lacked the drive you were
                        familiar with from living in New York?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes. But, there were a lot of smart people there, and a lot of people who
                    got good grades and who got a very good education. But there was perhaps less
                    awareness of the value of the education that they were getting. You know, people
                    seemed to have a great sense of entitlement. I remember one girl telling me, you
                    know, how very important her family was, that they were like millionaires in
                    their town, and I said, “Well, what do they do?” And she said, “Oh, my father's
                    a veterinarian.” And I thought, well, that's impressive but it's not brain
                    surgery. It's a great profession, he's an educated person and all that, but no,
                    that's not like, as you'd say today, being Donald Trump. So, I do remember
                    thinking, oh; it's kind of a different world.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your subjects? You say you were a history
                        major?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes, I was a history major. Somebody once said, “Janey, you majored in
                    little theatre.” I was certainly very active in our little theatre group. I was
                    also very active in student government because, I felt they weren't doing it
                    right. They needed me to tell them how to do it. Awful. Just terrible when I
                    think about it. But I was a very good history student. I was on the Dean's List
                    every semester and I gobbled up some scholarships.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did what was going on in the world having any impact: our
                        increasing involvement in Vietnam, the Cuban missile crisis, the
                        assassination of President Kennedy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: I don't remember the missile crisis with any great vividness. But everyone
                    of our generation can say exactly where they were when Kennedy was assassinated
                    and exactly what happened. It was a terrific intrusion of the outside world on a
                    rather self-absorbed little campus life. And it, I think it was the first sense
                    I had of national tragedy; what made me really understand the impact of Pearl
                    Harbor.</p>
                <p>There were people on campus who were against the war in Vietnam and who kept
                    talking about it. I would listen to them and be interested but I can't remember
                    having passionate feelings.</p>
                <p>I remember sitting in the cafeteria with a fellow student who was very much
                    against the war. I thought he was trying to recruit me and I said, “I don't do
                    anything that's not part of my studies, student government, and little theatre,
                    and that's what I do.” I was clueless. Not quite clueless. But I didn't know
                    very much about it. But even in this small place, very much off the beaten
                    track, and without much tradition of protest there were people who were talking
                    about what was happening in Southeast Asia and about how the draft was bad
                    because it gave us unlimited manpower to try to impose our will on the world and
                    that was breeding the arrogance of power.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about civil rights? I mean, upstate New York was very
                        far removed from Mississippi.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: That sort of thing I remember from high school, not college In high school
                    I had friends who were very active in local civil rights. They were people for a
                    sane nuclear policy and they were people working to integrate lunch counters.

                    did.</p>
                <p>I can remember being down in Union Square in Greenwich Village as a teenager

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, while you were at college did the subject of
                        diplomacy come across your radar? Did you meet anybody involved in foreign
                        affairs?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0012" n="Page0012"/>
                <p>COLE: No. We had the usual foreign students that we'd all talk to. I don't think
                    I even thought of diplomacy. At the time the professions that were open to women
                    were limited. I assumed that I would teach. My last year in college there were
                    seven of us living together in a house on the edge of campus. One became a
                    nurse, I became a teacher, another went to a secretarial school and became a
                    well-paid private secretary. Another became a social worker. We didn't have
                    anyone who studied library science, this was another possible career and there
                    were also increasing opportunities for lab technicians. And these limitations
                    were reflected in faculty attitudes. I can remember my economics professor gave
                    me a C. So I went to see him and he said, “Oh, I save my As and Bs for the
                    boys.” And I said, “Well, I think that if you were to re-average my exam grades,
                    sir, you would discover that I qualified as a B unless you found something
                    inadequate about my classroom participation. But I do notice that I only missed
                    one class and that was when I was quite ill. But I've noticed that you've given
                    good grades to some of my classmates who were absent; some told me how few
                    classes they attended.” Then he finally said, “Well, I suppose we could give a B
                    to a blonde.” And I played up, saying, “Oh, B for blonde. Very good, sir.” That
                    was probably feeding the beast but I did get my B.</p>

                <p>COLE: Well, in my senior year I had done student teaching in Liberty, New York, a
                    small town in the Catskills in what was then called the Borscht Belt. Hartwick
                    had set that up and monitored and helped me. It was a very positive and
                    interesting experience. Then I landed a job in Monticello, New York, where I
                    taught ninth and tenth grade social studies for some three years, including what
                    was then an experimental course in African and Asian culture in the ninth grade.
                    And then European history in the tenth grade. And I had fellow teachers who were
                    very good at getting summer study grants. So I got a grant one summer to do
                    Asian studies at the East-West Center of the University of Hawaii. It was a
                    marvelous six weeks. Another summer I went to Virginia Polytechnic Institute to
                    study revolution. And then the 3rd summer I was headed off to the University of
                    Hawaii's East-West Center for a Master's degree.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where is Monticello? I've heard of it but what's the

                </p>
                <p>COLE: Well, it is about two hours outside of New York City, also in the Borscht
                    Belt. It was at that time a location of a very large hotel and a number of
                    smaller hotels that had developed during the era of covenants when Jewish people
                    were not allowed into hotels so they developed these kosher facilities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now, which hotel was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: I knew you were going to ask me. Grossinger's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, oh, yes, well, this is, I think, probably the most
                        famous one of them out there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get to sample any of their entertainment? It was

                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes, they still had performances and they were wonderful days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were at the East-West Center did Hawaii stimulate
                        your interest in different cultures?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>COLE: From the first day I started on my BA, I knew I wanted to have a master's.
                    That was, of course, at a different era. Now I don't think you can do much with
                    an MA. But then you could. So I was always pushing to get good grades to go on
                    and get my master's. While I was teaching African Asian culture I decided that,
                    having done my BA mostly in European history, it would be very interesting to
                    get a degree in something related to China. I thought China was going to be the
                    next big thing. I think a lot of people in the '60s thought that Europe was
                    failing or it was old hat. We were wrong. But based on what we knew then that
                    seemed logical. So we were looking towards new ideas and new models and this
                    made China very interesting to me. That and a childhood spent reading Pearl Buck
                    though I later learned to not say that to my professors who all thought her
                    books were simply terrible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Africa, which at the time was newly liberated
                        and seemed likely to become more important?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: I was not attracted to it as much. I liked teaching about Africa,
                    particularly because I had a lot of African-American students in my class. It
                    was a diverse and educated community: a lot of German Catholics, a lot of
                    African-American students, a large Jewish population. And I can remember the
                    first time one of my students came into class with an Afro. We just stopped the
                    whole class and everybody admired his Afro and talked about it. We also studies
                    India and passive resistance. We read some Gandhi and organized a little mock
                    demonstration. And I wore a sari. We were able to link Gandhi with Martin Luther
                    King and what he was doing. It was very much of the '60s and really rather
                    marvelous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were determined to go on with China studies and get
                        your MA. How did this come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: I got a scholarship at the East-West Center where, at that time, they paid
                    for your tuition, room and board, books, and passage to Hawaii and back. I was
                    there from '69 to '71 including six months in Asia, mostly in Taiwan studying
                    Chinese so I could pass the language test. Learning Chinese was the hard part. I
                    did two years of Chinese in one summer, spending an awful lot of time in the
                    language lab going “ma, ma, ma,” trying to master the tones that are central to
                    the language.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you developed any views about China policy before you
                        went to the East-West Center?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>COLE: When I was teaching high school what I had always tried to do was to
                    present a fairly sympathetic approach to the People's Republic of China and why
                    they became communist - to explain who Mao was, what in his background had led
                    him and his generation in this direction. And I think I'd also dealt
                    circumspectly with the fact that we had perhaps mishandled our relationship with
                    China, although maybe that was an irrelevant question, you know, “who lost
                    China?”. I mean, they made their own decisions.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Taiwan?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Oh, I liked Taiwan. After having been in Japan and after all that bowing
                    and scraping, it was sort of nice to arrive in Taiwan and get a Taiwanese taxi
                    driver who spits out the window. Taiwan was just beginning to develop. It was
                    uncomfortable. It was hard. But you could see change occurring right in front of
                    your very eyes.</p>
                <p>However, my main thrust was on surviving and studying Chinese and coping with
                    loneliness because the Chinese view friendship as a very intense relationship;
                    they aren't open to casual friendships. So you're very isolated.</p>
                <p>And, of course, the Kuomintang government itself was very controlling. Almost all
                    the Chinese that one could talk to, had a story about being watched by a car
                    clearly labeled Secret Service. I remember saying to one man, a Chinese doctor,
                    at least they're not watching you secretly. And he said, well, no, that would
                    serve no purpose. They want us to know that they're watching us so that we will
                    behave; it's to make you virtuous not to identify your lack of virtue. I
                    thought, that's an interesting and Confucian way of thinking of it. But it was
                    perfectly apparent, that it was a very controlling and oppressive sort of
                    government. There was talk of corruption but I never experienced any of it. My
                    interaction with the civil service, from the Post Office on up to the Police
                    Department, was with very honest and efficient bureaucrats.</p>
                <p>However, I thought our support for Chiang Kai-shek was really stupid. Because of
                    this, unlike many people who spent a fair amount of time at the American
                    Cultural Center, called on the Embassy, and were on Embassy guest lists, I just
                    didn't want to go to do this. Unfortunately, I think I cut myself off. But I
                    just felt that what we were doing was excruciatingly stupid and that we should
                    be smart enough and powerful enough to maintain a relationship with Taiwan and
                    also recognize the Peoples Republic. And that we ought to be able to look at a
                    phenomenon like the Cultural Revolution and other Chinese policies in terms of
                    their historic roots.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any contact with our Foreign Service officers
                        who were going to school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: No. They were in Taichung and I was in Taipei, going to the Mandarin
                    Training Center of Taiwan University.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about Vietnam? Events there during this period
                        must have hit you as they did everyone else.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes, they did. And I, like everybody else it seemed in my generation, I
                    thought our policy was very bad, that we weren't going to win, that the war was
                    not winnable, and that maybe it didn't matter too much if we failed. But in some
                    ways I became more conservative in graduate school because I disapproved of the
                    demonstrations and of the students who didn't want us to study. And I said, that
                    the most radical thing that we can do is go to class and study about Asia. The
                    most radical thing we can do is go to our classes and learn how to speak
                    Vietnamese and Chinese. This is the best and most effective path to affect U.S.
                    foreign policy.</p>
                <p>I do remember one effort at the East-West Center to shut down classes. We had a
                    wonderful old professor, a Chinese, who came to class in a scholar's robe. He'd
                    actually been part of the May 4th movement, one of the first student opposition
                    movements in China. He was very, very old and they'd try to push him around. I
                    knew the organizer. In fact, I saw him when I went to my last alumni reunion in
                    November 2003. He said, “I remember you. You flew in my face like a crow.” I had
                    said that pushing around our professor was shocking, and he was going to think
                    that's the white kids. What you're doing is exactly what we're doing in Vietnam.
                    We are dissing a people's right to choose their own path and to be who they are;
                    we are a bunch of arrogant white people trying to make other people do it our
                    way. And I said, you should be ashamed of yourself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any feel for the Cultural Revolution?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: I think when I was teaching in high school I was more positive about it,
                    intrigued by Mao's Little Red Book and all of that. Then I got into university
                    and began to understand more of its origins and read more about it and discover
                    more about the terrible things that were going on. And I think one of the
                    reasons why I never sought an assignment in China was that I found myself very
                    rejecting of a culture that could produce such brutality. Now, I've come to be a
                    little bit more philosophical. All societies have this cruelty in them and some
                    societies do better than others in capping it.</p>

                <p>COLE: Yes, there were great debates about Taiwan and the Peoples Republic and the
                    status of both. There were quite a few students from Taiwan there and a lot of
                    the Americans were people who had returned from the Peace Corps or from work in
                    the Pacific Islands or elsewhere in Asia and were very Asian and internationally
                    minded.</p>

                </p>
                <p>COLE: Well, I was disappointed because I thought my MA would open up more
                    opportunity than it did. For one thing, I found that I was often competing with
                    Chinese-Americans for jobs and if it was something to do with China people
                    logically thought that Ms. Lee would be a better choice. And I could understand
                    that. I did go back to teaching for one year and I found I simply didn't like it
                    anymore. I wanted to do something different, something else. So I got myself
                    cracking and I found myself a job working for International House in New York
                    City, a residence for graduate students at various universities in New York
                    City. The idea was to being foreign students and American students together. The
                    students were largely but not entirely from Columbia. So I worked there for a

                    talent show, the outing to the Cloisters.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any tendency for the foreign students to retreat
                        into themselves? Did you need to figure out which ones needed a push to get
                        them out to participate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: No, I don't think that was much of a problem. One of the nice things about
                    International House was that it provided breakfast and dinner. And as everybody
                    came to the cafeteria style breakfast and dinner there was a good deal of
                    mingling that provided a lot of opportunities. But I remember doing some special
                    outreaches for some groups, the Iranians of whom there were a great many in
                    particular. They were disoriented at the time. This was my first experience with
                    Muslims. We were very interested in the Arab students. We tried to go to events
                    that they organized and to involve them in other activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: After about a year there, what did you do next?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: I needed more money so I went to work for a large non-profit youth serving
                    organization, where I stayed for some seven years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>COLE: Well, I don't think I'll go into it. But I will say that the seven years I
                    spent working there I really enjoyed. My job was setting up international
                    exchanges mainly for girls. At this point I was very much a feminist and I
                    didn't think that the school systems were serving girls terribly well, from what
                    I'd observed from teaching high school. They weren't serving them badly but
                    there were things not provided by the school systems that I thought were very
                    important for girls and one of them was international experience. So I was
                    mainly working with high school age girls and getting them overseas. I was also
                    working with girls from overseas, getting them to the U.S. And I spent a lot of
                    time working with Muslims girls who wore the hijab, finding places where they
                    could work that would give them successful experiences.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This must have been very difficult, particularly in that
                        era.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: It was a question of finding the kind of community where girls wearing the
                    hijab would be accepted, more where it was understood that these girls were not
                    going to sit in a room without an adult woman if a member of the male sex was
                    present. So you had to have people who were willing to adjust their expectations
                    and be sensitive and responsive. And, we were able to make it work, often small
                    town America worked very well. And an awful lot of our international students
                    loved, loved going to the Deep South to visit Black families because they said
                    it was just like home, because they were so family-centered.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What year was it when you finished there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: It was 1980. It was then that I began to think about the Foreign Service
                    which I had first been attracted to in '69 to '71 when I was at the East-West
                    Center. But I hadn't pursued it because two of my friends had applied to the
                    Foreign Service, passed the written exam, traveled from Hawaii to California to
                    take the oral, and neither of them was accepted. Both of them at the end of the
                    interview had said, now, can you tell us where we stand? One young woman was
                    told you're very pretty, we're sure you'll get married; which indeed she did.
                    And the other young woman was told we think you need to season a little while,
                    and besides, we're only allowed to have two people from each state and we
                    already have the two that are going to be from Hawaii. Why don't you just go and
                    get a little more life experience, dear. So, I thought, they're just not going
                    to accept women. And I knew too that at that time if you married you were
                    required to leave. And, of course, the idea was prevalent that when you married,
                    you would of course have children and when you had children you would stay home
                    and take care of them. So, in 1971, I went back to New York, taught for a year,
                    and then spent seven years running international exchanges.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, at the end of that time, what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>COLE: Well, before the end of that time I had a very charming boyfriend who was
                    going to Columbia's School of International Studies where he had lots and lots
                    of counseling from lots of professors. So when he decided to take the Foreign
                    Service test, we thought it would be nice if we both took it. But neither of us
                    passed. I was shocked. I had never failed a test in my life. And they broke it
                    down, as you recall in that year, and I could see that the area where I hadn't
                    done well was grammar. So, having in mind the possibility of taking the test
                    again, I began to study a grammar textbook and also started to read a newspaper,
                    The Christian Science Monitor, everyday, something I had not dome before.</p>
                <p>When the written exam came up again my boyfriend, who spoke fluent Russian, had
                    been taken on by the USIA (United States Information Agency) as a tour guide in
                    the Soviet Union. So he took the test in Russia and I took it in New York. The
                    day I got the notice, my very nosy next door neighbor was looking over my
                    shoulder as I opened my mailbox and he saw that I had passed. But I decided not
                    to pursue the opportunity and take the oral. I liked my job; I'd just gotten a
                    raise and new responsibilities and I was concerned for my mother's wellbeing,
                    since she was now alone living in New York City.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, my friend had returned from his Russian assignment and hadn't passed.
                    So I told him I hadn't passed either. But, my next door neighbor told him, yes,
                    of course she passed. So needless to say, he was very disturbed by this. And at
                    about the same time my mother found out, and she said, are you crazy? Take it.
                    Take it. She said, you know, you're going to need more money, you're going to
                    need a new challenge, this is what you got your education for. She said, I'll be
                    fine. So when they called me back two months later and offered me $2,000.00
                    more, I said yes.</p>
                <p>So at any rate at that point I went down and he at that time was in Washington,
                    DC, having got himself a job at Rand. And I came down, I remember staying with
                    him, and I went to the oral assessment and I was very lucky in that I had a very
                    dear friend who was our organization's librarian, this was the youth serving
                    organization, and she was the historian librarian archivist then. And she looked
                    up things about this kind of test that we were going to have. Do you remember,
                    it was the situational thing?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: And so she found out all about it, did research for me, went to the
                    Conference Group and got the lowdown on what this test was about and what it was
                    like and how it was graded. So, I thought, wow, you know, what a shame that this
                    isn't popular knowledge because it really gives the advantage to people who are
                    told this.</p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>But anyway, knowing this, I went in and sort of flew through the test. The only
                    mistake that I can make that I can think of is that I assumed it was like a job
                    interview, the oral assessment was like a job interview where they had your CV
                    in front of them. Well, they didn't because it was thought to prejudice them.
                    And at the last minute I finally said to this, said to the interviewer, I said,
                    well, you know, I've outlined this on my CV, sir, perhaps that could be a quick
                    and ready reference for you on this. He said, oh no, we don't have your CVs. And
                    I said what? He said, of course we don't have your CVs. And I said, well,
                    outside of this experience interviewers have them. So I had about 60 seconds to
                    tell him that, you know, I had a Master's degree in Chinese studies and I had
                    lived and worked abroad and I would be fine. That was the only piece of
                    information I didn't, because it never had crossed anybody's mind that they
                    wouldn't have the CV. But I did have all the background on the test and how they
                    graded it and what it was looking for so I also understood the tricks, you know,
                    that they put in, distractions and. Of course, as somebody once said, the
                    distraction that I had in my, they gave you a pile of memos, remember? You were
                    supposed to.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, the in box test.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: The in box test, right. And then the group negotiating test and then the
                    interview. So I had the scoop on what an in box test was and what they were
                    looking for and what they looking for in group negotiation all from my
                    girlfriend who had done this research for me through the Conference Group, which
                    had an element that dealt with hiring and testing. So, that was kind of a piece
                    of cake.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, I think this is probably a good place to stop
                        for this session. Then we'll pick this up, you've passed both the written
                        and oral exam. This is in what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: This was in '79, '80.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Alright. So we'll pick this up in 1980, and find out what
                        happens next.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Then I go off and join the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Today is the sixth of October, 2004. I assume you went into an A-100 course, the
                    basic officer course. What were your classmates like, how did you relate to them
                    and what did you think of what you were seeing?</p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>COLE: Okay. Well, this was when public diplomacy was handled by a separate
                    agency, the United States Information Agency, and so my A-100 course was really
                    a USIA entrance course. I don't remember how many people were in my class. But,
                    roughly a third were women and two-thirds were men. I really enjoyed the people
                    I was with.</p>
                <p>One of the things that I remember noticing was how much better educated the men
                    were than the women. The women tended to have BAs and MAs whereas we had quite a
                    few of the men were PhDs. I remember asking one of my colleagues about this who
                    just laughed and said, that most of these men were put through school by their
                    wives. In his case, it was his mother who put him through.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you feel that your background was typical?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: I was a little older than most of my class. Most of them seemed to me to be
                    in their late 20s and I was probably in my early 30s. So I was a little bit
                    older than many of them but not much. I felt that there was somewhat of a
                    mismatch, between the training and our experience. Their assumption was that we
                    were 23 years old and hadn't done anything much besides go to school. And while
                    that was true of a few people, it certainly wasn't true of most of the people
                    who had lived overseas and had had jobs and had some experiences. So, we were
                    always nudging the system to try and make it more responsive. And indeed, USIA
                    did subsequently reform the training system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did you have any, as you got into this, did you have
                        any feel for sort of what aspect you wanted to do or area you wanted to
                        serve in or was it sort of let the system take over?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: You know, I don't think that most of us fully understood until we got to
                    the field that there was, you know, some sort of a gulf between the Cultural
                    Affairs Officers (CAOs) who did exchanges and ran programs and the Information
                    Officers (IOs) who dealt with the press. I actually have done both kinds of work
                    and I don't see a great difference between them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had any of your group come in with a strong background,
                        worked on a newspaper for a long time or worked in museums for a long
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>COLE: Yes, we had some people who had that sort of experience, but I'm not sure
                    that it determined the course of their careers. At that time the emphasis was on
                    producing a Public Affairs Officer, a man or woman who could run the show. That
                    meant you had to know how to be both a PAO and a CAO. You had to understand
                    about the International Visitor (IV) Selection Committee, the role of the DCM
                    (Deputy Chief of Mission), and the egos of the political and economic officers.
                    You also had to understand that occasionally the phone was going to ring in the
                    middle of the night and it was going to be the press and that almost inevitably
                    you would say something wrong and get screamed at. And I have a feeling this may
                    not be entirely true anymore.</p>
                <p>Anyway, we also had a counterpart State Department class and we all went off to
                    West Virginia on a retreat, which was supposed to build up solidarity on both
                    sides. And we went also through part of our training with them, and I did make
                    some friendships that stayed with me for a long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, what happened? Whither Janey?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Whither Janey. Well, at that point, I had come into the Foreign Service,
                    speaking pretty good Chinese having tested at the East-West Center at the
                    equivalent of the 2-2. So I went in to see the personnel officer for East Asia
                    (EA) and said, I do speak Chinese and I'm thinking about taking the test. He
                    said, oh, don't bother my dear. We have men lined up for years who want to get
                    into China. You're not going. So I thought, the mere fact that I have a Master's
                    degree in Chinese studies with emphasis not on reading classic texts but rather
                    on communicating in spoken Chinese and reading newspapers and popular
                    publications seems relevant. But then I thought, well, the heck with that. I
                    think women have changed. I think the attitude today might be, well, fight back.
                    But my attitude then was; I'm not so crazy about going to China anyway.</p>
                <p>So anyway, they said, go and learn Spanish. So I went off to FSI (Foreign Service
                    Institute) and studied Spanish. The Spanish language training was like a
                    well-oiled machine because they processed so many people. It worked real well.
                    There were large classes; they kept shifting us around so that we didn't get
                    frustrated by being with people smarter than us or bored by people slower. They
                    built a lot of confidence. We heard a lot of different accents. It seemed to me
                    to be pretty good. And I passed my test and came back and said, fine, now I
                    speak Spanish. And they said, oh, splendid, proceed to Bangladesh.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, well, you can see the tie.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>COLE: At that point, I had started to learn a little bit more about the Foreign
                    Service. I said, I'm not going to Bangladesh unless I get Bengali. I made common
                    cause with a chap called Claud Young, who was African-America who had gone
                    through Spanish with me. He was going to a consulate in the Philippines. So the
                    two of us complained and together I think it sort of focused people and we both
                    got appropriate language training.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the language?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Oh, I loved the Bengali language. The teaching reflected the way things are
                    taught there. But still I got a quite a good background. I remember my teacher
                    making us memorize the names of flowers from Tagore's poetry. And they were very
                    poetic, little eyes of the angels, or little starflowers that bloom in the
                    spring. I kept thinking, shouldn't we know the common name? But when I got to
                    Bangladesh, I learned that Rabindranath Tagore used to write his poetry on his
                    family's farm. So he'd spend the monsoon season out on this farm on a barge that
                    would float higher and higher and higher as the monsoon swept through. Then he'd
                    go back to West Bengal in the winter and perform it or publish it. Then when I
                    got to Bangladesh, I discovered everybody called these flowers by their Tagorian
                    names even people from the villages. So I said, well, I guess my teacher was a
                    lot smarter than I thought.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you were in Bangladesh from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: 1981 to 1984.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: I was at that point what they called a Junior Officer in Training (JOT),
                    sometimes called a Public Affairs Officer in Training. We started off as a
                    rotation. First you spent a month or so at the USIA office doing anything that
                    needed to be done. You went out to the airport to greet speakers. You translated
                    the wireless, which was full of static, with blips and stars and things that
                    looked like the curse words in Beetle Bailey comics. And you had to translate
                    those into letters and there was a whole code for that. You made tea when an
                    eminent journalist came in. One of my jobs also was to turn up at my PAO's
                    (Public Affairs Officer) house and make sure that his beagle, who was slightly
                    senile, didn't peepee on anybody's foot. Fortunately I liked the beagle, he was
                    a swell dog. Or to make sure that his Irish setter didn't get loose and jump on
                    anybody. And I got a wonderful education that way. I got to see a real pro
                    work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the PAO?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>COLE: John Core, who had a spectacular career and then left the Foreign Service
                    quite angry.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On what, do you know?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: What was he angry about? Oh, boy. All kinds of things. I think I'd rather
                    not tell his story</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Well, when I first got there it was an Ambassador David Schneider, who'd
                    been asked to stay on. I remember him saying it was terribly embarrassing
                    because he'd already had his farewell parties and been given his silver tray.
                    But he was not there for very long. And then Ambassador Jane Abell Coon arrived.
                    Her husband, Carleton was our ambassador in Nepal.</p>
                <p>I did skip something though, you know. Part of the very interesting thing of
                    being a JOT in Washington, in addition to studying the Spanish and the Bengal -
                    I was here for 12 months, they used to do that - was I got to work in the area
                    office. And this is where I got to know Bill Rugh, Ambassador Rugh, who was the
                    area office director. And Jack Harrod was one of the senior people in the
                    office, one of the rising stars.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Bill Rugh was an Arabist, wasn't he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: He certainly was, certainly is.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I interviewed him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: I'm out of order now, but at one point I was looking after the Fulbright
                    program and we were working with AMIDEAST (American-Mideast Educational and
                    Training Services) to do certain things and I was able to arrange some grants
                    from them to conduct some activity and I remember he called me up and invited me
                    to come on over and have tea with him, which I did. He thanked me and it gave me
                    a very nice feeling. I said, do you remember I was a JOT? He said, yes, he said,
                    I remember you bought me jellybeans. Because this was when Reagan came in.
                    Remember the jellybean mania? So, I trotted on down to what was then Woody's and
                    bought everybody, you know a variety of different kinds of jellybeans. So, when
                    Mr. Wick, who was then appointed the director of USIA, came through everybody
                    who wanted them had these jellybeans on their desk. And all those years later
                    Bill Rugh looked at me and remembered them. So, we both had a nice laugh over
                    it.</p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>So, I was a JOT in the NEA (Bureau of Near East Affairs) office. And Louise
                    Taylor, do you remember her name?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, I've interviewed her.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: She was the desk officer for Bangladesh. And she said, Janey, I'm going
                    away on two weeks of vacation. Take over.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, in Bangladesh, what was - it was called
                        Dacca?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was it like when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Bangladesh, you know, we all fall in love with our first post, don't we? I
                    remember just before I left Washington I was buying some clothing and I heard on
                    the store radio that there'd been a coup d'etat and General Ziaur Rahman had
                    been killed. I was so shocked. And I remember the lady in the dress shop saying,
                    was it somebody you knew? And I thought, well, it feels like I do.</p>
                <p>I arrived in Dacca shortly after that, flying into Dacca during the monsoon when
                    about two-thirds of Bangladesh is under. I came in just as the sun was setting
                    and I was looking out over this great plain, this great estuary, and it was all
                    silver, a sheet of silver. It was beautiful, just beautiful.</p>
                <p>What was Dacca like? Well, at that point it was famous for having the worst
                    embassy building in the world in terms of the physical appearance. The building
                    belonged to the Ministry of Youth which occupied the upper floors. As you walked
                    into the building it smelled like a toilet because that's how people used the
                    ground floor. And then you could take this tiny and rickety elevator - run by a
                    little tribal gentleman who used to sort of sit perched on a stool - which was
                    always getting stuck between floors. Then the operator would stand up on his
                    stool, knock open the little door in the top of the elevator, grab the cables
                    and jerk them. Or, you could walk up the stairs which were full of homeless
                    people who were living there. And in certain seasons, the stairwell was full of
                    jute-moths, which, if they brushed against you and you had been perspiring would
                    leave welts on your arm. The building also had a stairwell in the center which
                    was intended to improve circulation. It was covered over with wire netting;
                    someone said they must have put the wiring over it so people wouldn't commit
                    suicide by jumping down. It was filthy and full of garbage. And it was so
                    depressing.</p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>Also, for most of the time I was working at the embassy there was a huge struggle
                    going on in the government bank across the way, where the government was trying
                    to fire all the people who did no work. It got quite violent and we used to have
                    bullets bouncing off our windows. I was in the office that had the great big
                    copying machine in it and all the supplies for tea and it was about the size of
                    really a clothes closet. And then there was a desk jammed in there where I sat
                    with my back. When they started to shoot, I would either run out and chat with
                    the secretary or I would crawl under my desk.</p>
                <p>I remember a journalist came to see me one day and stuck his head in and there I
                    was underneath my desk. “Miss Cole?” I said, “Yes, get down, get down!” So, you
                    know, it was typical junior officer stuff.</p>
                <p>Now, what was not to like.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. How about living conditions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Actually, they were pretty good. I was the first single woman to be given a
                    house to live in. Previously, they had put all the single women into apartments
                    for their own safety. But, I was supposed to be learning how to entertain like a
                    USIS (United States Information Services) officer. And I was slated to become
                    the deputy PAO as my follow-on there. So it was important that I have house. And
                    I got this darling little beautiful house. Nothing bad happened to me, so, that
                    broke the back of that particular tradition.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about your work. I imagine you did a variety of
                        jobs. You know, take different aspects and say what you were doing and what
                        the situation in which you were working was like.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Okay. Well, I was there for a very interesting stretch of three years, a
                    long time to be in a very difficult post. After the coup d'etat the situation
                    stabilized for a while and elections were held. However another coup d'etat then
                    overthrew the elected government. So, we were dealing with a lot of political
                    turbulence. However, the main emphasis of our embassy was on development. The
                    main thrust was family planning. The idea was that if you could help people keep
                    their children alive they would have fewer of them. So there was quite an
                    emphasis on conquering diarrheal disease because that's what killed most
                    children. And on clean water and on getting family planning information to
                    women. At the time it took quite a leap of faith and many of us thought it was
                    hopeless. But, in fact it was largely successful. Population growth in
                    Bangladesh has been brought under control. Now people in villages say, we used
                    to have a lot of children because a lot of our children died; we don't have to
                    do that now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did your work involve passing out information about
                        this program?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>COLE: Yes. USIA handled a lot of the informational work with the press. In
                    performing public diplomacy, as it's now called, we were not only talking to the
                    government. We dealt occasionally with government officials but dealing with
                    them was largely the job of the political section, the economic section, or
                    other elements of the embassy. Our job was to speak to people who influenced
                    public opinion, the gatekeepers they were called. And this was an interesting
                    and exciting time to do this in Bangladesh because Bengali intellectuals, are
                    very lively, interesting people whose brains do work. They are also ideologues
                    in a way that Americans are not so I had to learn to think in a very different
                    way and to present information within an intellectual framework where all the
                    pieces were expected to fit together.</p>
                <p>Journalists, of course, were principal targets as were university professors who,
                    in a largely illiterate society at that time, exerted considerable influence
                    both within their classrooms and outside. Performing artists and other creative
                    people also had considerable influence and I did get to know some of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned that a lot of influential people were
                        ideologues and you had to present things through their intellectual
                        framework. Can you give us an example or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Even at that time we were trying to make the world safe for American
                    capitalism. There was, then as now, a great pharmaceuticals debate, having to do
                    with intellectual property rights. So you had to be able to put intellectual
                    property rights in a way that socialist-oriented people would understand what
                    they were and perhaps be sympathetic to the idea.</p>
                <p>Now, this is where creative people come in, because creative people live off
                    their ideas they can understand that you can't have people stealing them or not
                    paying them for their ideas. This led me to get involved with movies and
                    moviemakers because the Bangladeshis made a lot of bad movies which were
                    exported to the Middle East.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were these like Bollywood films?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: They were the Bangladeshi version of Bollywood.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did everyone have a song in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>COLE: Oh, several, and a wet sari scene. But they were pretty mild, pretty family
                    oriented. They would appeal to South Asian workers in the Middle East but they
                    were also watched by lots of other people in the Middle East because they were
                    wonderful stories and the music was great. But the really upper class mode of
                    entertainment was television. It was widely believed that a lot of movie
                    actresses were women of dubious morality but the TV starlets were not.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did the policies of the Reagan administration fit into
                        Bangladesh at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Not easily. Just before that it had been common to emphasize the aspects of
                    our society that might be regarded as socialistic such as our extensive public
                    school educational system or Social Security. But after the Reagan
                    administration came in you couldn't really emphasize those aspects of our
                    culture. You had to approach it somewhat differently. And I can remember the PAO
                    being called up for a meeting with the political office and the DCM and he
                    invited me to come along. They were criticizing him for being so right and
                    saying why is your organization so rightist? He said because that's who we
                    elected president of the United States. You're perfectly right, that's our job.
                    They tell us what to say and we go out and say it. He brought along a lot of
                    material for them to read and their eyes pretty much glazed over and that was
                    the end of the meeting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any spillover into Bangladesh from our embassy
                        in New Delhi?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes. I was in New Delhi an awful lot mainly negotiating for more resources.
                    They had a very good book publishing program. USIA would get the rights to some
                    American books that would be republished in India where instead of costing
                    $25.00 they would cost $2.00. There was a system to get the publisher to
                    distribute the books, USIA would keep some of the books, some of which would be
                    sent to us in Bangladesh to give away. I remember saying, as a woman functioning
                    in a Muslim country I can't send whiskey as Christmas presents. I can send a
                    book. And since status is a high motivating factor in South Asian cultures,
                    having a book from the U.S. embassy meant you put it right out where everyone
                    could see it.</p>
                <p>Another of my responsibilities was to run our translation program. We translated
                    books into Bengali which we then presented as gifts. Choosing these books,
                    acquiring them, finding the people to do the translation, finding the people to
                    do the editing, getting them through the process was quite a job.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>We also ran something called Table of Contents, TOC, as well as something called
                    Article Alert. TOC involved sending out to select recipients the table of
                    contents of certain publications that were coming into our library, for example,
                    we would send foreign ministry officials the table of contents of Foreign Policy
                    Magazine. And people certainly liked getting this. Or we would send a playwright
                    the table of contents of some magazine of theatre arts dealing with subjects he
                    was interested in. The program was very, very, very focused; a select group of
                    people were being provided with a service they liked a lot and that encouraged
                    good relations.</p>
                <p>I remember going along on a call to a powerful government official to be the note
                    taker when I was on rotation in the political section. But the official just
                    wanted to talk to me saying, you're the one who sends me that table of contents.
                    I remember working on yours, I said, I understand you take an interest in the
                    arts, sir. That was a blind guess because all Bengalis are cultured. He told me
                    what he was particularly interested in and there I was, taking notes. When I
                    handed him the non-paper, he just threw it in a drawer. When we left his office,
                    my colleague said, “Well Janey, you were obviously the star.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would the table of contents service bring them to the
                        library?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes, or they could call me up, or call up our librarian and ask for what
                    they wanted. There was also something called Article Alert which was supposed to
                    replace Table of Contents but people wanted both. This was a list of articles,
                    from which you could select those you wanted to order from USIA. They were from
                    thousands of different magazines. We would send them over or deliver them
                    personally to provide the occasion for a useful conversation.</p>
                <p>At the time, the government was starting a school for diplomats, like our Foreign
                    Service Institute. They did not welcome visitors but I suggested coming over to
                    deliver some material, bring the USIS librarian and find out what material they
                    might want. I was one of the few people to actually get in and meet with the
                    director who told me what kinds of things he was interested in and how he was
                    using them. And then some of his deans and professors came through because word
                    was out that there was this pretty little American lady sitting there with the
                    head librarian. I got to meet most of the faculty. So, it was a real door
                    opener.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the universities? So many universities around
                        the world have a strong Marxist faculty and all and the students are ardent
                        Marxists until they come out and get into the real world. Then they become
                        ardent capitalists. What was the university situation in Bangladesh when you
                        were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>COLE: Well, it was pretty bad. In 1971, during the secession from Pakistan, the
                    universities had been thoroughly trashed by the Pakistani army. Intellectuals
                    were put up against walls and shot. Female students were raped; male students
                    were killed. After that the university was just wracked by politics. We set a
                    couple of goals for ourselves and then we used our resources to achieve them. We
                    wanted to strengthen the teaching about the United States. We found that the
                    people in the political science faculty although they were Marxists, were a
                    little less devoted to Marxism and a little more interested in comparative
                    studies of constitutions or political systems. So our strategy was not just to
                    encourage a course about the United Sates, because that would be taught from a
                    Marxist point of view but to provide them with more and better information. This
                    was at the time when USIA was sending out piles and piles of copies of the U.S.
                    constitution. We discovered that a lot of what they taught was driven by the
                    books they had. So we helped do a textbook of original sources translated into
                    Bengali - declaration of independence, the constitution, and a variety of other
                    basic documents that you would need to understand the U.S. political system.</p>
                <p>We also wanted to encourage teaching of American literature because of the high
                    status of literature in their culture. Although we knew it was going to get a
                    Marxist spin, we felt it's important to read Emily Dickinson and Robert Frost,
                    poets who are not hard to understand and could affect the perspective,
                    particularly of young people. We were able to put the resources USIA was
                    providing into people's hands. We were able to give them material so the
                    professors could lecture knowledgeably about Emily Dickinson or about Robert
                    Frost or Ann Sexton or Sylvia Plath or whomever.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was English pretty much a second language in the academic
                        population?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes. We were fortunate in that almost all educated people read English
                    quite well and most of them also spoke it fairly well. Also, we were translating
                    a lot of material into Bengali, which was kind of revolutionary and certainly it
                    was helpful to the students. In that respect we were getting around the formal
                    system as well as infiltrating it by putting these books out through publishers
                    and donating them to little regional libraries and to high schools and learned
                    societies.</p>
                <p>However, our major thrust was on teaching English as a second language and
                    getting U.S. content into the instruction. English teachers were remarkably
                    non-ideological; their business was to teach their students how to read and
                    speak English. So, anything that would make that easier they would use and we
                    could provide them with a lot of material. I got to know most of the master
                    teachers of English in the university and normal school system and I got very
                    involved with the academies that were training the teachers who were then going
                    off to the high schools and elsewhere to teach English. And we did a lot of
                    programs designed to improve their English and a fair number to try to get
                    resources into their hands. Using literature to teach English was very
                    successful and we had a lot of resources to provide.</p>

                </p>
                <p>COLE: The journalists were great fun, but they were very ideological. They'd all
                    been through the struggle for independence from Pakistan and were very political
                    but they were interesting. And so we did the old-fashioned things. We'd call on
                    them and have tea and listen and try to find out what they wanted. Did they want
                    to go to the U.S.? Did they want to get their junior reporters to the U.S. to
                    see what real newspapers were like? Were they interested in American cinema?
                    Well, we could send them Table of Contents from an American movie publication.
                    Or, what book would they like. And what about The Wireless File? How did they
                    get it; how did they choose articles; what could we do to get them to choose
                    more, or use more, and publish more?</p>
                <p>

                        War?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Well, they wanted to be on the Soviet side because we were the enemy for
                    not having supported them in 1971 in their war with Pakistan. So they would have
                    liked to have been Soviet allies but there were difficulties with that. The
                    Soviets didn't particularly want them. The Soviets didn't produce very much by
                    way of aid because the Soviet theory was that you had to overthrow your
                    capitalist government and become Marxist, Leninist and all your problems would
                    go away, economically, and all would be fine. So they didn't provide any of the
                    aid the Bangladeshis needed. They used Dacca as a dumping ground for their
                    ambassadors; they sent one who didn't speak English. They did have a huge
                    embassy compound however and their big asset was swimming pools and restaurants.
                    Their technique was to invite intellectuals to come for the weekend; they could
                    swim and could hang out in air conditioning so this was very seductive. They had
                    a cultural center. They had a chess club, which was popular. They showed Russian
                    movies. They had some things that were appealing. But on the whole, I think we
                    were better armed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was India a massive presence? I mean, were the
                        Indians doing a lot of stuff there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes, the Indians were actually fairly active and they were a huge, looming
                    neighbor. Bangladesh had been part of Pakistan when it had broken away from
                    India; India was the Hindus, Bangladesh was the Muslims and India was kind of
                    scary whereas we were kind of warm and fuzzy. Our major competitors were really
                    the Germans and the French.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm surprised the French were paying much attention to
                        Bangladesh.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>COLE: Oh, the French pay attention to culture, don't they? Everywhere, even the
                    most obscure places. They had a program for painters, which was actually pretty
                    good; I met a lot of painters in Bangladesh who had been sent to France. The
                    nice thing about the French is that they didn't tell them what to do; they just
                    said, go to museums, spend three months, enroll wherever you want and off they
                    went.</p>
                <p>There was also a minor Bengali tradition of studying French rather than English.
                    It must have been a sign of rebellion in the colonial period to study French and
                    to look to France for your cultural linkage, rather than to England. They were
                    still teaching French there and teaching it rather well. And the British
                    Council, of course, was extremely active. I learned that they sent over people
                    who were helping the Bangladeshis write their textbooks. And so I got hold of
                    the people doing a literature textbook and gave them copies of Emily Dickinson's
                    poems they thought were perfectly splendid and should be included in their
                    textbooks. So I asked what if I give you some more to read and you choose what
                    you think is suitable. So we got Dickinson in and then they put a little Robert
                    Frost in. But they decided Sylvia Plath wasn't suitable for children. There were
                    others as well whom I can't remember.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the exchange program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Before I joined the Foreign Service in my earlier job I'd been on the
                    receiving end in the program for bringing people to the U.S. So I knew a fair
                    amount about what would happen these visitors in the U.S. And so I focused on
                    learning how to run an international visitor (IV) program, skills that served me
                    for the rest of my career. I don't see any great changes between the way the IV
                    program is now and the way it was 30 years ago except that it's shorter now; we
                    used to send people for six weeks and now it's four or three. It seems to me
                    that we had a little less input in the program then; there's more creativity
                    now. I can remember the point in 1986 where we started to design our own IV
                    projects which wasn't something that we could do before. During the Reagan
                    administration grants began to be given to private organizations to set up
                    programs, for example a USIA grant supported a program for social workers, or
                    for junior politicians, or teachers. And we would be asked to nominate
                    organizations. In its early stages it was a mess but it became very efficient
                    under what is now the Office of Citizen Exchanges and is partnered with private
                    sector organizations.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about your library? How well was it used?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Thousands of people used it, it was perpetually jammed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So many countries really don't have what amounts to a good
                        library, a really open library system.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>COLE: No. They don't have the money for it, they don't have the mentality for it.
                    Eventually USIA, now PD (Public Diplomacy) within the State Department, came to
                    the conclusion that it was not our job to replace the public library system,
                    that countries should have or to create it. So our libraries were severely cut
                    back and focused on policy. But as long as we kept them they were awfully good.
                    And fortunately in South Asia, they were able to keep libraries going. There to
                    be literate in English gave you status, so we had a self-selecting audience of
                    fairly important people who patronized our library. Sometimes they were just
                    students but they were going to grow up to be somebody, that was obvious. I
                    thought our disinvestment in libraries was very sad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I agree with you. I've often felt that our exchange
                        programs and our various libraries and centers were so important and it's
                        shortsighted to cut these out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Well, I don't think that exchanges have been severely cut. There was
                    considerable criticism of the Fulbright program until Mr. Wick, who was for some
                    eight years, the director of USIA, discovered that it wasn't really our program,
                    it was a Congressional program named after a senator. And so the Senate was
                    determined to keep it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find being a young woman embassy official in
                        Bengali social life? How did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: It worked wonderfully. You know, my FSNs (Foreign Service Nationals) were
                    great. At that point in Bangladesh the embassies were the place to work and the
                    American embassy, which was famous for always paying you your salary, on time,
                    attracted some rather marvelous people. So they made sure that everybody knew
                    who I was. In South Asia women have higher status than men. So Bangladeshis are
                    flattered when the U.S. sends women officers. It means to them that the U.S.
                    knows we'll be respected and safe there and recognized that Bangladeshis are
                    spiritually and culturally superior people.</p>
                <p>People wanted to invite me to their homes because this gave them status and
                    recognized that they were advanced culturally. So I was very sought after and I
                    would be out night after night and my PAO taught me to have goals for each of
                    these occasions. Who was I trying to meet and what was I trying to accomplish?
                    And he said, just keeping the channels of communication open is a perfectly
                    valid goal. You may just be going there to see who's there, to see who knows
                    who, who sits with whom, who's related to whom, what do they have on their
                    walls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about lectures or performances and that sort of
                        thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>COLE: Oh yes, we had quite a few American speakers, then called AmParts. These
                    were people who were experts brought out by USIA who spoke at the university to
                    the various ministries and training academies and confer with the editorial
                    board of the leading newspaper. We have to have real expertise, just not a smart
                    person. But this was the time of Charlie Wick's blacklist of people who were
                    ideologically not acceptable. Walter Cronkite was one of them. You would propose
                    someone and some little bureaucrat would write down, “not to be asked.” They got
                    it all wrong, they had a blacklist.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, after that did you end up going native, wearing a
                        sari and all that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Oh never. Not at that point. Never. I did have a sari that I'd gotten
                    before I joined the Foreign Service and whenever the FSNs invited us to a party,
                    I would wear it. And everybody just loved that.</p>
                <p>Later on, it was towards the end of my career that the mentality changed and I
                    also got sufficiently senior to say, the hell with the mentality, and I was able
                    to wear my salwar kameezes for dress up in Pakistan. You needed to have pretty
                    clothes, because Pakistani women were always beautiful. In fact, Pakistani men
                    in their silks and their embroideries and their diamond buttons were also
                    wonderful to look at. And what are we going to do, turn up in a little black
                    dress? No thanks. Plus, the little black dress, you know, showed your lower
                    legs, which were considered wildly sexual. You didn't want to do that. So being
                    able to go out and buy a beautiful salwar kameez meant that you were properly
                    dressed and that you had something to talk to the women about, even the very
                    traditional ones. If they could talk a little English you could talk to them
                    about what you were wearing and ask them for their advice and help. And I
                    learned a lot.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, you got exposed to everything in the business
                        didn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: That was what the junior officer or a public affairs office - a PAO or a
                    JOT - was supposed to do, see the full array of USIA activities. Plus we also
                    rotated through different components of the embassy. The secretary in the
                    political section, the wife of the administrative officer, didn't think that
                    this rotation made any sense at all and she wouldn't do anything to help me. So
                    I arrived there with no desk, no telephone, no chair. So I asked the USIS FSNs
                    to talk to their cousin who ran the warehouse and quickly a chair materialized.
                    And when the chair arrived this nasty secretary had to point to a desk. And then
                    a day or two later somebody produced a telephone for me, through the FSN
                    conspiracy network. I did my couple of week's rotation in the political section
                    and then I did Econ. The econ officer wanted somebody to run a catalog show for
                    him. And so I called up my FSNs over at USIS and said, what is this? They said
                    they'd go find out, so they did, and we set up a catalog show. And I also
                    rotated through Admin, which was the section I enjoyed the most.</p>

                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes, it's true. You know, my first couple of weeks I wondered what a nice
                    girl from Brooklyn like me was doing in a place like this. But yes, I certainly
                    came to enjoy it and I also came to appreciate the fact that for the rest of my
                    career, whenever somebody had a really bad idea about what I should do I could
                    always say, you know, I spent three years in Bangladesh. And they'd dismount and
                    walk away.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes, so you know, there's a lot of people out there who have dues to pay;
                    I'm not one of them. Go bother them. Yes, it works, it's good.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, what, in '83 you left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: '84.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '84. Whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Venezuela, because I had Spanish. My ambassador, Jane Able Coon, asked me
                    if I wanted to go to China. And I said, no, I don't. I want to go to South
                    America.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to, where? Do we only have one post in
                        Venezuela?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Actually we had, at that point, two. We had Caracas and Maracaibo. I went
                    to Caracas, to the capital city, as the exchanges officer, a position which at
                    that time was pretty good. Now they've downgraded all the exchanges officers
                    enormously, but at that time Venezuela did not have its own Fulbright
                    commission. So you had to do that work yourself, which is a model we should
                    follow. Venezuela being one of our main sources of petroleum, we had a lot of
                    grants under the international visitor program. Then there were other
                    miscellaneous exchanges like the citizen exchange program. There was another
                    officer who did speakers.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>COLE: I guess it was '84 to '87. Three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: It was Ambassador George Landau, who didn't like female officers very much.
                    We were okay when we were fairly junior.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, sort of cute young things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes, and whenever I had to go see him I always dressed a certain way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, we'll come to that later on. Who was the PAO?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Our excellent PAO, Marilyn McAfee, who eventually became an ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '84 to '87, what was happening in Venezuela at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: It was quite an interesting country. Jaime Lusinchi was fairly pro U.S.A.
                    During the periods of political disruption he had gone into exile with his wife
                    and had ended up in the U.S. where they let him practice medicine. They put him
                    to work in some, I'm sure, perfectly awful hospital in the middle of Spanish
                    Harlem but he thought that was wonderful. He was doing medicine. So he always
                    liked us. And the Venezuelans at that time were pretty pro-U.S.A. at all levels.
                    The anti-U.S.A. feeling that the current Venezuelan administration is tapping
                    into surprises me a little.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk about your work there. First, what were
                        the elements of Venezuelan society that you wanted to reach?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Venezuela was a very different experience. It was difficult. It was much
                    harder to identify whom you wanted to reach because it was a well-educated,
                    highly-literate society with a lot of activity, and a lot of creativity. We kept
                    our eye on the press but there were no identifiable columnists or pundits.
                    Anybody at anytime would pop up with an article.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You didn't have, as the French do, a corps of
                        intellectuals?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>COLE: Not much, no. It was very surprising. The Venezuelans had gone in for mass
                    education. So you had a country with a very high literacy rate, a lot of people
                    got to go to the university. It was like the United States. In this country if
                    you were doing the same work, how would you do your targeting? So we watched the
                    newspapers and who read what newspapers. I spent an enormous amount of time at
                    the universities because I was running the Fulbright program; we had no
                    Fulbright commission. I targeted faculties. Again, I found political science to
                    be more modern less hidebound than others. I found study of the United States
                    very well incorporated into the teaching of English. I did a study of high
                    school textbooks with my FSN. Marilyn McAfee was wonderful; she hired an extra
                    FSN for me whose job was to study what was going on in high school education. So
                    I talked to some people back in Washington, friends who'd served in Scandinavia
                    where there were some of the same issues. How do you figure out where to aim?
                    And they were not aiming at the university; it was taking care of itself. They
                    aimed at high school education, secondary education. In Venezuela's very
                    centralized system just a couple of textbooks were used. We went through the
                    history books to try to find what they were teaching about the U.S. And then we
                    went through the English language materials to see what they were saying about
                    the U.S. I tried to write this all up so the next person wouldn't have to repeat
                    it. We pursued programs very aggressively for sending teacher trainers to the
                    U.S. And we focused a lot on teacher training institutions. But I have to tell
                    you, it was really quite a challenge. One of the things that I did there that I
                    was proudest of, again, this was with Miss McAfee's leadership, was to design
                    our own international visitor program.</p>
                <p>We designed our own IV group project when these were very new. We would take a
                    group of eight and combine members of the Venezuelan military, with which at
                    that time we had good relations with some politicians or party intellectuals, or
                    university professors or journalists. For awhile those were wildly successful.
                    Venezuelans appreciated them as a way of getting to know each other which they
                    had not done in the past because the military was totally segregated. And so
                    they went off to the U.S. to take a look at grassroots democracy, something
                    Venezuela did not have.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you give an example of what this disparate group would
                        see and do?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                <p>COLE: Venezuelans, as I say, didn't have any grassroots democracy. They voted for
                    a party with a slate of candidates. So your representative didn't come from your
                    neighborhood or your state and you didn't select him. You just voted for the
                    party which got a certain percentage of the vote and then selected a certain
                    number of people to be sit in the legislature. They would have to consider
                    peoples' preferences but basically you weren't casting your vote for a
                    candidate; you were casting it for ideology, for a party. As Venezuelans got
                    better and better educated they got less and less satisfied with this, and were
                    more and more interested in having more control over selecting their
                    representatives. The idea of splitting a ticket was becoming more acceptable to
                    them. The idea of having local self government became more and more appealing.
                    So, we would have them look at city government, state legislatures, political
                    campaigns, how people get elected, how do local elections work. The League of
                    Women Voters always had a nice program.</p>
                <p>There was always a briefing at the Pentagon and people loved that because just
                    walking through the Pentagon was exciting. I talked to a political scientist who
                    said he'd studied it all his career but to actually be in it and see the size of
                    it was remarkable. They'd get a very good military briefer who would talk to
                    them about U.S. military policy. We would brief them on how we managed our
                    military. Their soldiers, unlike ours, can't vote. Venezuelans had no absentee
                    ballot arrangements; they were intrigued by that. Because they were influential
                    people, we had them received by the deputy assistant secretary (DAS) for South
                    America who, with others on his staff, would discuss political, economic, and
                    trade issues with them.</p>
                <p>Sending military officers was something new and when I was in Bangladesh I had
                    actually sent a military officer in a civilian capacity and all hell had broken
                    loose. It had taken my PAO a stack of cables to get this cleared because I
                    hadn't known any better. The military always wanted to know what to wear. And I
                    said, you can pack your uniforms but you can't wear them for much of the
                    program. You can wear them when you go to the Pentagon and Fort Leavenworth but
                    not in-between. So I got copies of magazines like Esquire or Gentlemen's
                    Quarterly, and we'd look at clothes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously we're selling the United States but what you're
                        saying is, look, we've got a great system here. Implicitly, why don't you
                        change your system? I mean, this gets tricky.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: And you can only do it well if people have approached you and said at some
                    point we're going to have to change our system and we'd like to see yours; we'd
                    like to see the Canadians, we'd like to see how they handle this in different
                    countries because Venezuelans are becoming well enough traveled to realize that
                    their system is for children. It was probably okay at one point but it was no
                    longer alright. So, they wanted to know, and you have to find something that
                    will interest and hold them and will not seem patronizing.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking about universities, I've never served in Latin
                        America but I have the feeling that these universities more than anywhere
                        else are citadels of Marxism and whatever it is, but you they're sort of no

                </p>
                <p>COLE: No, no, no, no. You just have to know how to do it. In Venezuela the older
                    generation were the doctrinaire Marxists. Ah, but youth, their purpose in the
                    world is to make their parents crazy. And what was the best way to do that?
                    Become a supply side economist. So we were very interested in speaking to them.
                    We made friends with the vice chancellor, who was a Marxist but we established a
                    personal relationship with him, personalismo (in Latin America, the practice of
                    glorifying a single leader, with the resulting subordination of the interests of
                    political parties and ideologies and of constitutional government is very
                    important). And he actually gave me a grant from the university to fund a group
                    of student leaders to go to the United States. He was just getting tired of
                    people rioting in the halls and disturbing classes and whatnot. So we sent this
                    group of young people off to the U.S. and they had a ball. And they came back
                    perfectly armed to drive their parents crazy. And we did a couple of those. I
                    remember my PAO just being tickled to bits because she got this money from the
                    university to pay for part of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The political scientists in the United States have gone
                        over the edge trying to turn the subject into a science looking for formulae
                        and trying to reduce everything to figures.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: At that time that was happening in the economics department, but not in
                    political science. And he was anti-Marxist because that ideology didn't
                    determine how you did your equations which was still more of a study of systems.
                    In economics they were moving on to using equations and very much changing the
                    way in which they thought about economics. We did get a speaker from George
                    Mason University, but he wasn't terribly good, and then we got a Fulbrighter,
                    who was one of the new economists, and he was quite good. So we got him to a
                    university where he could spread his poison.</p>

                <p>COLE: Well, I was still at the point of gaining skills and I think, Venezuela is

                <p>COLE: It was more the British Council; teaching English was kind of a business.
                    Our bi-national centers were aiming at the masses, whereas the British Council
                    was kind of the Cadillac of the system. But I used to spend a lot of time
                    talking with the British because we didn't want to trip over each other. We did
                    that only once. When they closed down their school in Maracaibo, they donated
                    their equipment to a private English teaching institution. I said, you should
                    have given the equipment to the international school instead of generating
                    competition for us.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at Venezuela today, there is Chavez, who is pretty
                        much anti-U.S., and he has appealed to really the lower social order. Were
                        we looking at that group, were they reachable or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: I don't think that we were. I was in Venezuela at a time of relative social
                    peace. Jaime Lusinchi was a very popular president. He was born out-of-wedlock.
                    He was devoted to his mother, an Italian immigrant, and people admired that. He
                    was a nice, pleasant fat man who looked like Santa Claus, and he was like
                    Clinton in terms of his common touch. He was also like Clinton in terms of his
                    love life but in Venezuela, a man who didn't have a mistress probably wouldn't
                    have been trusted. The drama between his wife and his mistress kept everybody
                    entertained. His wife, poor lady, was no doubt suffering terribly. It seemed to
                    me that everyone in most social classes was relatively content at that time. The
                    country was prospering. They'd been through a bad downturn and now they were
                    turning up again. It was fairly optimistic. The reformers thought they could
                    change the political system; this was why they were going off to the U.S. to
                    look at things. El Presidente (The President) was popular, accessible; in his
                    own way quite a man.</p>
                <p>I remember Venezuela's national day was July 5 and I remember him at our Fourth
                    of July party, linking arms and drinking with our ambassador. He stayed and
                    stayed and of course, none of us could leave while the President, and the
                    Venezuelans weren't leaving. It was getting to be 3:00 a.m. and this man who
                    would have to be very active the next day was still swilling the ambassador's
                    champagne. He downed copious amounts of liquor and he danced and he hugged and
                    he kissed and he schmoozed but next day he was perfectly fine. He went through
                    the entire Fifth of July celebrations, did it all again.</p>
                <p>It was a time of moderate economic stability, social stability, optimism and a
                    fairly popular national leader. So, I don't think that we were reaching out to
                    the lower social orders. We were focused on the gatekeepers. And I think our
                    focus on secondary school education was pretty good. And just as I was leaving I
                    got involved with vocational education but I didn't get very far with that; I
                    had to leave that for the next person. But no, the outreach that has come in
                    recently to a broader, deeper, younger, population to the degree that we've
                    continued it, was something of a revolution.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did Venezuelans look to the United States as opposed to
                        Europe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes, there's no doubt about that, although they also look to Europe. They
                    had a huge scholarship program, the Fundacion Gran Mariscal Ayacucho, when all
                    the money was rolling in from oil. And this had sent hundreds of young students
                    to the United States to get degrees. The fund had offices in New York and in
                    Venezuela, and all over. It was credited with quelling the student rebellion
                    movement because everybody was off in the U.S. where you pay attention and
                    divide your time between having fun and going to class. There hasn't been a
                    sustained student political movement of the kind they have in South America.
                    Even though an economic downturn stopped the program while I was there, a lot of
                    young people in entry level positions and mid-level positions who had been to
                    the U.S. to be educated and were very pro-American. They, of course, were
                    amongst the classes of people that Chavez attacked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about Maracaibo?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: I was in charge of the link between Caracas and Maracaibo. At that point we
                    had an American officer there who was the head of the bi-national center. A big
                    problem was created by a law requiring the heads of all educational institutions
                    to be Venezuelan. So we got some help from an eminent Venezuelan educator whom I
                    found, and he advised us to split your English teaching from your bi-national
                    center. It can be physically located there, but find somebody to head it who's a
                    Venezuelan, perhaps an American woman married to a Venezuelan. And that's what
                    we did.</p>

                </p>
                <p>COLE: I came back to the U.S. for a posting as a desk officer thanks to Marilyn
                    McAfee's assistance. She was the PAO in Chile and she wanted somebody on the
                    Andean desk, which then included Chile, who would understand her needs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, today is the 27th of October, 2004. Janey, you were
                        back in Washington from '87 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: 1987 to 1990.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So about a three year tour.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0042" n="Page0042"/>
                <p>COLE: Two years of it was on the Andean desk in the office of what was American
                    Republics (AR). For one year I had a fellowship to work on the Hill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, well let's talk about when you were in AR doing
                        Andean affairs. What did that include?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Chile, Peru, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia and Venezuela at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What sort of work were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: At that time, and I think probably still today, desk officers were kind of
                    a bridge between policy and the field. We fed in reactions, ideas, and
                    developments from the field into the Washington machine, and we passed to our
                    posts what policy was and what needed to be done. You also spend a fair amount
                    of time troubleshooting. You get a furious call from somebody in the IV
                    department who wants to know why the international visitors from one of your
                    countries are so awful. And so you say, no, don't send a cable, don't write a
                    memo. Let me call and talk to the CAO (Cultural Affairs Officer) or the PAO
                    (Public Affairs Officer). And you do.</p>
                <p>You also spend a lot of time passing out scarce resources: international visitor
                    grants, private sector grants, Fulbright grants, speakers, world nets. Sure
                    there are more people that want these resources than can have them because of
                    limits on money, staff, and hours in the day; you spend a lot of time
                    negotiating with your fellow desk officers and then with the cultural
                    coordinator - Lynn Seavern in my day - to work out who is going to get what and
                    why. And then you spend a lot of time talking to the boss (in my case the area
                    director at that time was Jeff Dietrich and the deputy was Carl Howard), and
                    getting their interpretation of priorities from higher up and translating them
                    into the kinds of actions that will look good, that will fulfill the
                    requirements.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were there, you were more or less at the end of
                        the Charlie Wick era, weren't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: I entered the Foreign Service in 1981, just as Reagan was coming in and
                    Charlie Wick, therefore, was also coming in. I came back towards the tail end of
                    the Wick administration. I have to say that as unpleasant a person as he was, in
                    some respects he really did make a change for the better.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, for one thing he had ideas and some of them weren't
                        bad at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: No. Quite right.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0043" n="Page0043"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And he also was able to get money. You know, sometimes
                        when somebody's been there for almost eight years their interests, their
                        power and everything else begins to run down. Was there a feeling of waning
                        of interest or was he still keeping up the pressure?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Maybe the pace of the ideas slowed, because I think he had already managed
                    to achieve most of what he wanted. But, I don't think that his energy or his
                    interest ever slackened. I think he got smacked a few times by Congress and
                    learned that there were some things that he needed to back off on. For example,
                    we were finally able to do some WorldNets with Walter Cronkite, who was supposed
                    to have been on his blacklist. And I think he also learned that certain
                    management techniques, which are entirely legitimate in the private sector,
                    cause a lot of heartburn in government. You know, such as tape recording his
                    conversations with people. I believed his explanation that he did it so that he
                    would remember what the action items were so that his secretary could type them
                    up. But, of course, it upset people enormously in Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as a matter of fact, I've talked to people who were
                        staff aides to the secretary of state and his immediate deputies and they
                        usually have a rather junior officer listen in on calls and make notes to
                        record what needs to be done. This was very much a practice and, in theory,
                        not a bad practice one because decisions are made on the telephone but you
                        don't remember what they are.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Because another call comes in, someone else walks into your office,
                    somebody calls you up and hollers about something and it goes by the by.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, were there any particular issues dealing with your
                        Andean parish?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Chile, at that point was always the big issue because the Reagan
                    administration wanted to take a stand; show that they were against
                    dictatorships. So Chile was their exhibit where they could line up with the
                    liberals on the Pinochet regime and demonstrate support for democracy. This got
                    a fair amount of attention and I attended a number of conferences and meetings
                    where I explained this to the assembled liberals. And it worked very well
                    because that got us lots of funds to support activities for Chile.</p>
                <p>Drugs are always an issue and it's always a code word for Colombia. Drugs
                    overwhelmed everything else in our relationship with Colombia and that was very
                    bad because, obviously, not everybody in Colombia is a drug dealer. And there
                    were a lot of people who wanted to talk to us about something else besides
                    drugs. That pitted the State Department against DEA (Drug Enforcement
                    Administration). And we were fortunate finally in getting a good ambassador down
                    there (I can't remember his name) who understood that if you wanted to address
                    drug issues you had to talk to people about other things, keep the channels of
                    communication open.</p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>Also, the other issue was Roundup, a type of defoliant chemical related to Agent
                    Orange. DEA wanted very much to use it, you know, to drop it over the fields of
                    coca plants and destroy them. I thought that for a number of reasons this was a
                    very bad idea (eventually, the company that made Roundup refused to sell it to
                    the government). When I came back to my last assignment after many years away
                    from Western Hemisphere affairs and after years in South Asia, we were spraying
                    Roundup and exactly the issues that we thought were going to arise were
                    arising.</p>

                <p>COLE: I think that there were holds on people. Later, in 1989 to 1990, when I was
                    on loan to the Congress and was a staffer in a senator's office, the Moscow
                    embassy tried to send a group of right wingers and some of these people were
                    anti-Semites. In many ways it was a very good choice but it really raised hell
                    on the Hill.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the Zhirinovsky group, I think, who were quite
                        important within the Russian political scheme.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes, they were. It probably would have been good to send them to the U.S.
                    On the other hand, that was not necessarily how the Hill saw it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any connection with Charlie Wick or was he
                        too far up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: No, much too far up. I was in Venezuela when he visited there but my job
                    was somewhat removed from his interests. I was instructed to keep our
                    Fulbrighters out of his way. Although we invited them to the reception it was
                    with strict orders not to talk to him. Or if he asked, talk about your family.
                    And most of them thought it was very funny but they all did what I asked because
                    I told them if they didn't I would be in trouble.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the issue? He just didn't like to talk to
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>COLE: Well, I think he thought that a lot of college professors were lefty
                    anti-Reaganites and were not really supportive of U.S. foreign policy. And he
                    was quite right, you know. However, this is a Congressionally mandated program
                    that we are charged to carry out. One of the hardest things in the course of my
                    career has been to explain that this is not our program. A good officer treats
                    it as if it were and attempts to make it so but in truth this is the U.S.
                    Senate's program and they give us the money to run it for them. So they
                    intervene if they don't like the way we're running it. You can find yourself in
                    a lot more trouble than it's worth to get cross with your Fulbrighters. But of
                    course you do try to make policy implications clear to them and you do try to
                    help them be effective and not get into trouble with the embassy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did any embassies give you any particular problems? Or
                        PAOs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: One doesn't like them all equally, I must say. But on the whole they were
                    pretty good and pretty effective, I thought. We had good PAOs; I don't have any
                    horror stories.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you hit hard by our policy in Central America? El
                        Salvador, Nicaragua and Honduras were all bubbling over at the time with the
                        contras and the Sandinistas and the death squads.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes. All those nice leftists in the Andean republics were on the side of
                    the rebellious leftist forces. But there were also significant groups of people,
                    influential people in the Andean countries I was working with who were not on
                    their side who didn't think they were going to win, who didn't think they were
                    right, and who regretted the damage that they were doing. At that point we had a
                    lot of good friends in Venezuela who were perfectly happy to provide asylum for
                    people from Central America but who basically were very critical of leftist
                    movements. And the Colombians, being plagued by some very nasty leftists, were
                    not always sympathetic to the various leftist movements in Central America, nor
                    were the Peruvians, who had one of the nastier ones.</p>

                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes, Sendero Luminoso was pretty mean and a lot of people who were
                    themselves leftist were very disconcerted by Sendero and also, they were busy
                    with their own concerns and their own political problems. So I was surprised. It
                    was there, it was an issue we had to address. We were denounced; we saw the
                    headlines; but it was not as virulent as I might have expected it to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, in '88, you moved over to Congress?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>COLE: Yes, '89 to '90. I was there under a program administered by the American
                    Political Science Association; in which you stayed on salary with USIA (United
                    States Information Agency). First you attended a little mini-program at Johns
                    Hopkins that got you up and running, brought you up to date on how a bill
                    becomes a law in reality, not what we learned in sixth grade. And then you went
                    out and had to find somebody to hire you.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you go about looking? Did you have anything in
                        mind?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: We were advised to look for someplace where there was a connection. So I
                    tried the Hawaiian senators, but they weren't interested. Then, since I came
                    from New York, I shopped around with the New York/New Jersey senators, mainly
                    focusing on Democrats and ended up with Senator Lautenberg. This was in his
                    first term. That was fine. I never changed to the House; I stayed with the
                    Senate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Senator Lautenberg was the senator from where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: At that point he was the junior senator from New Jersey; the senior senator
                    was Bill Bradley.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Well, being a Congressional staffer is all about getting legislation
                    through and it took me awhile to understand the process. Initially I was just
                    learning the ropes, which meant I was meeting with various pressure groups from
                    New Jersey and writing up the pros and cons of their proposals. This was at a
                    time when Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia were moving out from under the Soviet
                    Union and there were a lot of people in New Jersey who belonged to these ethnic
                    groups. So I spent a lot of time on the phone with them and a lot of time
                    writing up what they were saying. My high point was when the foreign minister of
                    one of these countries, a woman, came to Washington and testified. I was treated
                    as the expert, having been dealing with these obscure ethnic groups and told to
                    write the Senator's questions. And I got to sit right behind him with my
                    briefing book on my lap and I was on television. My mother was very proud.</p>
                <p>Also, I tried to educate my colleagues over there about how the State Department
                    worked and where they could go for information. Because most of them were in the
                    habit of calling desk officers or when there was a crisis they'd call the
                    information center. But I said, why don't you learn how to use INR (Bureau of
                    Intelligence and Research) and talk to people who are really knowledgeable.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Senator Lautenberg as both a politician
                        and as a person?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: He was an excellent manager and I really felt lucky to be working for him.
                    An awful lot of the senators were not particularly good managers. They had no
                    management experience; they were lawyers or they were politicians; they ran
                    campaigns. But he had been the person who had brought to us computerized
                    payrolls. That's how he made his millions, and he actually knew how to run a
                    company. So he was very good to work for, very clear. His own staff thought that
                    sometimes it was too bad he was a little less interested in the Senate because
                    of course, that was their whole lives. But, I think he had a grasp of the fact
                    that most of the things that happen in America don't happen because of something
                    a politician does or says; they happen out in society, in the economy, in the
                    culture, the universities, the newspapers; they happen in other places. So, he
                    was pretty calm about the whole thing. It was nice to represent him to business
                    people. They'd all tell me, we'd much rather talk to Lautenberg's office than to
                    Bradley's office, because Bradley's people were interested in making their
                    senator president of the United States. They were not interested in talking to
                    the Glassmakers Union, or some little businessman who was interested in getting
                    in on the ground floor in Poland.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, how did this experience play in your later
                        career?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Oh, it was wonderful. My next posting was three years in Nepal, right after
                    the movement for democracy and the re-establishment of parliament and political
                    parties. I was there for the promulgation of the constitution, the setting up of
                    the parliamentary system. It was amazing how much more I knew than a lot of the
                    other people there about how our government worked. Our ambassador was Julia
                    Chang Bloch, who was very political. She started out as a Peace Corp volunteer
                    and then had gone on to work for Senator Percy. The thing that she said she was
                    most proud of in her government service was the passage of the bill that
                    required that whenever we spent money on development, we had to evaluate the
                    impact this would have on women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When were you there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: 1990 to 1993.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>COLE: I was the PAO, and the ambassador's counselor for public affairs. (That was
                    kind of a reward for being effective on that international visitor from Russia.)
                    At that time in USIS there was a PAO, an APAO (Assistant Public Affairs Officer)
                    and an executive secretary and a sizeable number of FSNs (Foreign Service
                    Nationals). I always said “apr�s moi le deluge” (after me the deluge) because it
                    was really severely cut after I left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the situation in Nepal when you arrived in
                        1990?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Hopeful. They were trying to get the parliament up and running, getting
                    political parties organized, dealing with a lot of underpinnings in a country
                    that went from say the 14th century into about the 18th century in a couple of
                    weeks. If you could dial back in a time machine it would be a lot like being
                    with our founding fathers, at the end of the 18th century as they wrestled with
                    the divine right of kings - deciding who would vote and how, how you would set
                    up your congress, what would your institutions be like? They weren't starting
                    from scratch, they had some models of their own. But creating national
                    institutions and making them work was quite a challenge. And, that's about where
                    the Nepalese were. They had some models from earlier periods of their history;
                    they had conducted elections before but they were looking around for models;
                    they were trying to make it work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, what was it you were doing there? What defined
                        your major activities?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: PAOs always have to keep the ambassador informed about what's in the
                    newspaper and I had to spend some time doing that but mainly I spent my time
                    supporting democracy. The ambassador made USAID give us some money so we could
                    support more IV grantees. So I had to negotiate that through, and then design
                    the IV projects and help select the participants, get them oriented and on their
                    way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that if Nepal is moving towards democracy
                        there would be tremendous pressure from the Indian government, say, look at
                        us, don't look at those other people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Well, I don't think the Indian government had to exert much pressure
                    because indeed, that was what would naturally happen. The leading opposition,
                    the leading party in support of democracy in Nepal was called the Congress
                    Party. The role of India in Nepalese democracy was well acknowledged. But, it's
                    also true that India is the local great power and everybody hates the local
                    great power, so the Indians were wildly unpopular in Nepal. Nevertheless, their
                    influence was enormous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there interest in American as opposed to, say,
                        the British type of democracy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                <p>COLE: The new leadership was looking in all directions. They were very impressed
                    with the Japanese model because the Japanese had an emperor and they saw
                    parallels with their king and in the way Japanese society worked. They spent
                    some time in Norway looking at their hereditary monarchy. But, if there was any
                    system that they would know beyond the Indian it was the British, so they were
                    very interested in the British system. I had a lot of trouble with my colleagues
                    in AID and I spent a lot of time saying that whether they adopt our political
                    modalities is not the issue. What they have to understand is how our government
                    works so that their expectations of us are reasonable and their understanding of
                    how we make policies that affect them, is based on reality, not on some sort of
                    mythic image of the West. I said that's my number one priority. If they also
                    learn how to set up and run a congressional committee system, all the better.
                    And of course AID didn't see it that way. They were interested in practical
                    outcomes. So we had to craft and compromise and negotiate.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nepal has had this sort of Maoist group going. Was there
                        much in that line when you lived there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: They were there but at that point they were in the government. And there
                    was a Marxist-Leninist party that was very much inside the government. So it was
                    a period of relative peace, but there was always tension over whether we would
                    work with those people or not. I thought we should work with them and others
                    thought we shouldn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have much contact with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: The embassy was not happy but we had a little contact with them. We brought
                    in a Senate staffer to talk to MPs. The speaker of the house and I had to work
                    out a system where he invited the Maoists and I could go to the ambassador and
                    say, I couldn't stop him? But I think she understood perfectly what game was
                    afoot. So we did bring them in that way and I did spend time talking to some of
                    them and to some of the more leftist members of the mainstream Marxist-Leninist
                    party.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did they have much feel for the United States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: No, no they didn't. The people who rose to leadership positions in the new
                    democracy had either been in exile, usually in India, or underground, or in jail
                    for any number of years. And what they knew about the outside world was really
                    somewhat limited. They knew about India and they had an awareness of China and
                    of Britain; if they knew any democracy it was Britain. But no, we were a
                    surprise to them.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How would you describe the royal family, their role, and
                        our contacts with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: That was handled mainly by the ambassador so I never met the king, the
                    queen or the crown prince. The princess royal was accessible but I never met
                    her. Those I met were sort of secondary royals like my next door neighbors, who
                    rented me my house. Once a year they'd come for a Christmas party and once a
                    year I'd go to their house. I didn't get to meet various rebellious members of
                    the royal family who were leading human rights movements or some of the Rana
                    families who were smart and active.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the crown prince who went out and killed
                        everybody?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes, wasn't that terrible? No, I had never met him although I had a good
                    friend who was a Rana and the most senior woman in the civil service as the
                    permanent undersecretary of the supreme court. She knew him, but I don't think
                    anybody foresaw what was coming. I also met the young woman he wanted to marry
                    and understood who she was and who her family was and why he would want to marry
                    her; she was lovely. And I was very surprised to learn of the queen mother's
                    opposition to this match. So no, his behavior came as quite a surprise to
                    me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Would Rana, what was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: They were the hereditary ministers of Nepal in the period when for many
                    generations the king was sort of a captive inside his palace while the country
                    was run by the Rana family. But, of course, the Ranas had all married into the
                    royal family because they were of the same caste so it was very hard sometimes
                    to sort them out.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the human rights situation when you were

                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>COLE: Oh, it was certainly improving and I thought actually it was fairly good,
                    all things considered. When Tom Korologos, the Republican lobbyist visited us,
                    the ambassador and I went with him, a Nepalese journalist, and the speaker of
                    the house, on a helicopter trip up to the high country in the winter to watch
                    the yaks being herded down and visit a Sherpa village. As we flew, the speaker
                    of the house looked down and said, that's where I was in prison. And he pointed
                    to a little village in the foothills of a really high mountain. He told us this
                    story and in a way it was a symbol of how bad things had been. He said he had
                    been a worker for democracy and was told to resist being arrested. He said some
                    five or six really big guys came down and grabbed him on the front steps of the
                    courthouse - he was a lawyer - and hauled him just like he was a load of laundry
                    into the paddy wagon and pitched him in the back and closed the door. And he
                    thought, oh my God, this is it. I'm going to disappear. They drove for what
                    seemed to him to be days (probably actually 24 miserable hours) and then they
                    dumped him like a load of laundry in this really remote prison. Initially he had
                    no way to tell his family where he was; he was scared to death they were going
                    to come for him some night. But eventually he made friends with the warden who
                    was not a stupid man and figured things might change and got word out to his
                    family where he was.</p>
                <p>He was so high up his heart was pounding, and it was very cold. He had a little
                    money in his pocket that he used to buy a knitted cap from a local woman. He put
                    it on, he said, immediately his head was warm; it was the first time he was
                    warm. He said it was the first time he felt safe or decent or comfortable in the
                    whole experience was when he paid her five rupees and she left ecstatic to have
                    this money and he got this wonderful hand knit hat he was wearing when we took
                    this ride. So the human rights situation had been very, very, very bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the role of women when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Nepal at that time was still governed by the code of Manu, the traditional
                    Hindu code which was very, very hard on women. But, we were seeing more and more
                    women politicians and the ambassador did special outreach to them and we did
                    everything we could to be supportive of their situations as well as women
                    academics and other women.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were the Gurkha a force?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: The royal family were from the Gurkha nobility. I was always surprised that
                    the Gurkha were not much of a force but maybe that was because we knew less
                    about what went on in rural areas where a lot of them settled when they
                    retired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How effective did you find our Peace Corps there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>COLE: They seemed to be very effective. I traveled with the ambassador a bit
                    because I was her spokesperson and I used to joke and say it was because she
                    could send me into the ladies room to check on the toilet paper. We did visit
                    several of the Peace Corps sites. In terms of their relationships with people,
                    my guess is that they were very happy. But they were less happy with their
                    professional achievements. The educational system, although improving was still
                    very bad and people didn't work hard and didn't take their job seriously and
                    this was hard for Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: A public affairs officer always has to deal with the
                        media. What was the media like?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: They were typical of the Third World, where you became a journalist so you
                    could express your opinions not so that you could report the truth. So the media
                    was very opinionated and very personalized. I spent a lot of time saying to
                    journalists: in our country you put your opinions on the editorial page; you
                    separate what's news from what's opinion. I was concerned for accuracy, and I
                    spent a lot of time talking to the men who ran the Marxist Leninist party
                    newspapers saying, you know, this is not helping things. Do you believe what's
                    written down here? And they'd squirm and they'd say, well, it does seem sort of
                    farfetched, doesn't it. And I said, well, does it help things? Does it promote
                    democracy? Does it promote good international understanding? Does it help to
                    solve the problem that you're writing about? So, we would spend a lot of time on
                    this. But how helpful it was I can't say.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about TV? Was it all Indian, or did they get TV from
                        anywhere else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Everybody loved watching TV. They had a Nepalese television studio that was
                    run by one of the competent Ranas. When they were good they were really good;
                    you can see how they ran the country for so long. And they showed a fair mixture
                    of things including American soap operas.</p>
                <p>I used to be invited over for dinner and to watch television at people's houses.
                    I used to say, this describes your families; it's not accurate on ours. All of
                    these illegitimate children and multiple marriages and scandals, I said, sounds
                    like some of your nobility, not like us.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the nobility the jet set type?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: No. There were a few people like that but for the most part no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Americans? Did you have a problem with both
                        ends of the spectrum? From the hippies at one end of the spectrum coming
                        overnight to get drugs, and at the other end the wealthy mountaineer types
                        who are used to getting their own way.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>COLE: There were no hippies or very few when I got there in the 1990s. Freak
                    Street was a thing of the past and those people were gone. It was mainly
                    backpackers and trekkers and every climbing season we would get the
                    mountaineering groups. There were always parties for them and you always went
                    because you knew some of them weren't going to come back; the mountain would
                    take them. But since I wasn't doing consular work I didn't have trouble or
                    didn't encounter these people much or have trouble with them. Our consular
                    officers used to have to go and try and find the bodies, but I didn't have to
                    deal with any of that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get any high level or medium level visits from

                </p>
                <p>COLE: Oh, yes. Sichan Siv, who was the deputy assistant secretary, came. He was
                    an Asian American; he knew the ambassador. Oh, there were others too. Korologos
                    came as did former Senator Percy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find Ambassador Bloch? How effective was she
                        and how did she operate?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: She was excellent. She understood politics. The chief justification for
                    political appointees is that they can do politics. She understood politics and
                    politicians and she could sit down at a breakfast with some group of what I
                    thought of as particularly slimy politicians and I'd be there to pass the
                    coffee. She'd have them passionately engaged in explaining what their strategies
                    were. That was a great plus; it gave us great insights into what was going on.
                    It would be nice to think that there are people there who are that skillful
                    now.</p>
                <p>I was later to see that same thing in India with Ambassador Richard Celeste who
                    had been governor of Ohio and he understood exactly how politics worked.</p>

                </p>
                <p>COLE: I had to come back to the U.S. then because my mother was very sick; I was
                    very concerned about her condition. So I asked for a home posting, and I was put
                    in charge of the section of the Fulbright program that worked with NEA (Bureau
                    of Near Eastern Affairs) from Marrakesh to Bangladesh.</p>

                        felt were the right people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes. I thought it was working reasonably well. I think we tried a couple of
                    things that didn't work out during that period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For example?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Just before I came onboard we had given a grant to the Fulbright Commission
                    in Cairo to manage a large conference to discuss U.S. relations with Islamic
                    countries. It turned out to be too dangerous to do it in Cairo so the conference
                    was held in Germany. Then we learned that a lot of the American scholars were
                    not willing to express any opinions because they didn't want to get in trouble
                    with the host governments whose goodwill they needed in order to conduct their
                    research. If your area of expertise is 17th century Syrian glassware you've got
                    to be able to go there, and if you're on the Syrian government's enemies list
                    that's not going to happen. So the Americans were very hesitant to participate
                    actively and the conference was largely dominated by the Egyptian intellectuals
                    who are very strong and very vocal and sometimes resented by folks from other
                    countries. So my own feeling was that maybe we ought not to do this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel that Islamic governments were cutting down on
                        the intellectual dialogue? It really strikes me that even then. in the
                        mid-'90s,there was a hardening of the intellectual arteries within the
                        Islamic world as far as opening to the United States and Western Europe was
                        concerned.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: I think that this hardening of the arteries intellectually had been going
                    on inside Islam for about two to three hundred years. There was also the
                    post-colonial awareness of the newly freed. I spent most of my career in
                    countries that had been colonies fairly recently and it was suddenly clearer to
                    these countries that they could control the flow of information and they could
                    control access to their country by scholars from the U.S. or elsewhere. Getting
                    host country clearance for our Fulbrighters was very, very difficult.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were our posts striving to do something about that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>COLE: The program was largely owned and operated by Fulbright commissions, in
                    which the presence of U.S. government officers was often limited or weak. I
                    never served on one. Often it was a fairly junior exchanges officer who went to
                    their meetings. Often they were pretty much owned and operated by host country
                    nationals. It was difficult; I spent a lot of time meeting with these folks. It
                    was difficult to understand at times whether our scholars didn't get their
                    clearance because of incompetence or laziness, or whether it was a political
                    decision. Certainly most of the scholars who worked in the key countries in the
                    Middle East believed that the decisions were political. And they were people who
                    spoke the language and knew the culture and had been there before so I accepted
                    what they said. Getting permission to leave or enter the host country was
                    fraught with politics. And you had to step carefully. Getting a Fulbright grant
                    approved through our end of things also had its political aspects.</p>
                <p>The oversight organization, the Board of Foreign Scholarships (BFS), was made up
                    of political appointees of Democrats and Republicans. One of the hardest things
                    we had to explain to other people including our embassies is that the program is
                    owned and operated by a higher power and it's necessary to tread carefully. If
                    the ambassador decides he's going to expel some Fulbrighter he doesn't like for
                    joining a Maoist demonstration in front of the embassy, and if that Fulbrighter
                    has good connections with his congressman or his senator, they can make life
                    difficult for that ambassador.</p>
                <p>I remember a member of our board of the BFS who was concerned with NEA, a man
                    called Daniel Pipes, who was very pro-Israeli. Occasionally Israelis would roll
                    their eyes and say to me, with friends like this I'm not sure we need enemies.
                    But he was a very skilled and knowledgeable Middle East scholar. Also, he didn't
                    like women's studies; he didn't think that was a real academic field. And so he
                    tried to block a woman from Sri Lanka who was coming to do women's studies. And
                    he didn't think theatre arts were appropriate so he tried to block a U.S.
                    scholar who was doing something in theatre. He had a lot of good ideas, though,
                    and he was sincere, and he was disciplined and hard working. I happened to think
                    he was wrong but that doesn't invalidate his opinion. I had to spend an awful
                    lot of time dealing with kind of the political problems he generated. We had a
                    professor, an African American law professor who was going out to work with the
                    Supreme Court of India and they were interested in two things. They were
                    interested in affirmative action and the issues relating to it and they were
                    interested in judicial education. And this chap had real expertise, but Pipes
                    didn't want to send him out because he said his area of expertise was
                    affirmative action and civil rights legislation.</p>
                <p>But there was someone else on the NEA subcommittee who had been an associate of
                    Senator Fulbright and was a friend of Bill (Clinton). I went to him and told him
                    what Dr. Pipes had said. And I said, I take it you don't agree with the
                    professor's objections. He said no. Sp I explained that the nomination would go
                    back to the BFS subcommittee for NEA, and I gave him the names of the members,
                    their phone numbers, and e-mail addresses. (Of course, I had to be perfectly
                    neutral in this.) The professor did go out. It seemed to me that there were ten
                    such cases a year.</p>

                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And then what? This would be, we're talking about '97 or
                        so.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes, thereabouts. Calcutta opened up and it had always been my dream to go
                    to Calcutta.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: When I had served in my first post in Dacca, Calcutta had been this promise
                    land where you could go and buy food, go to the movies, and walk on the street
                    and it was just wonderful. Also, I had studied Bengali and I had liked it very
                    much; it was a language of my heart, and the idea of going back to where it was
                    spoken was just enormously attractive to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you went to Calcutta from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: From '96 to '99.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the third of November, 2004. What was Calcutta
                        like when you got there in 1996?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: It was a city that had greatly improved since I had seen it in the early
                    1980s. The supply of electricity was much, much better. The telephones worked a
                    whole lot better. It seemed to me that almost everything had improved. I think
                    it reflected the fact that India was emerging from the Fourth World into the
                    Third and their economy was growing, the country was becoming more confident and
                    competent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, when I hear people talk about Calcutta I always
                        think about the beggars in the street. How was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>COLE: Not bad. I mean, even in 1981 the popular image of beggars in the streets
                    was not quite accurate. At the birth of Bangladesh in '71 enormous numbers of
                    refugees, thousands, maybe millions had come across the border to Calcutta.
                    These were Hindus who had been driven out by the Pakistani army and were afraid
                    to go back. They were refugees in dire need who overwhelmed the infrastructure
                    in Calcutta, then essentially a 19th century city. It had Dickensonian
                    industries and being there was like being in the middle of a novel by Dickens in
                    many respects. But by the time I got back a lot of those refugees had been
                    absorbed into the fabric of Calcutta.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: I was what we used to call the branch public affairs officer. But our PAOs
                    in New Delhi were more or less freeing us from the constraints of working
                    through the center. So we were able to negotiate our own programs, do our own
                    reporting and be the PAO for a district that included all of Eastern India,
                    millions and millions of people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the PAO in New Delhi?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Well, first it was Ashley Wills and then he moved on to be DCM and
                    eventually became our ambassador in Sri Lanka. And then it was Frank Ward, who
                    had been his deputy and then moved up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the consul general in Calcutta?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: At that time we didn't as of yet report to the consul general. When I
                    arrived it was Bob Boggs. He went on to become, I think, political counselor in
                    Delhi and then DCM in Kathmandu. After him it was Cheryl Simm who is still in
                    the midst of her career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your objectives there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: A long-term objective for USIA and public diplomacy today, is to make the
                    world safe for capitalism, particularly American capitalism. We did an enormous
                    amount of economic programming attempting to explain, particularly to the
                    Marxist-oriented Bengalis, what capitalism was, what a joint venture was, why it
                    wasn't a big scary thing to have American or foreign partners in a joint
                    venture. For a lot of the other people living in Eastern India you didn't have
                    to do this because they themselves were entrepreneurial. But the Bengalis
                    dominate politically and intellectually so you have to talk with them.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were the entrepreneurial-minded people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: A lot of people who at partition were driven out of Pakistan into Calcutta.
                    There were a lot of Sindhis, Hindus from the Sind in what is today Pakistan who
                    fled for their lives. They tended to be small and medium range traders. Then of
                    course there were the Marwaris; these are people from Rajasthan who back in the
                    British period immigrated into Calcutta and established themselves as the great
                    trading class or clan and they are traders by caste, traders by inclination, by
                    training. Some extremely respected and some extremely disliked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you work with these various groups? Did you find
                        opportunities in the university? Was Marxism influential there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: I loved working with the university. One of the things that I had learned
                    in Venezuela is that the young always want to exercise their prerogative to make
                    their parents crazy. And if you want to drive your dear old Marxist Leninist
                    professor father bananas, what do you become? A Reaganite economist. So it was
                    wonderful fun to go out and talk directly to students. You'd ask them, why
                    should you have second class things? Why should your only choice for a car be
                    one that was based on a 1940s British model? Because that's what the masters in
                    Delhi have decided should be manufactured. And why should they improve it when
                    there's no competition? And I asked, why are your mothers, continuing to wash
                    stuff by hand when you could have a clothes washer and make it really hygienic.
                    And this appealed to people.</p>
                <p>We were also very lucky in that a Bengali intellectual, long settled in the West,
                    named Amartya Sen who won the Nobel prize. And a lot of his work was in social
                    capital.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the Nobel prize for economics?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: For economics, yes. Like most good Bengali boys, he came back every winter
                    to see his parents. They lived in Santiniketan, the community established by
                    Rabindranath Tagore, right in the bosom of Bengali culture. And he was a great
                    proponent of the argument that while the state should be interested in
                    generating the infrastructure of economic success, it shouldn't be busy managing
                    the economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did USIS translate this into action?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>COLE: We took policy and turned it into programs or actions to explain it and to
                    change people's behavior. One of the things I remember doing was sponsoring an
                    address by Amartya Sen, and then having it transcribed and printed up in the
                    magazine that was published in New Delhi and circulated to some of our contacts.
                    We also staged conferences where we would bring in a variety of experts both
                    from India and from the United States to talk about joint partnerships, what
                    they were, how they worked, the intellectual framework for capitalism. We had
                    professors come through and they sat with the academics at the university and
                    talked about the issues related to being entrepreneurial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I would think that you would have run into strong
                        opposition from the entrenched faculty of the universities.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: That was not necessarily the case. Bengalis all have ironclad beautiful
                    manners; they're a real credit to their families. And they are interested in
                    ideas, truly, deeply, profoundly, bred in the bone; they want to know. Moreover,
                    even ideologues, could look around and see that things were changing, that it
                    was no longer the Congress Party in Delhi giving out licenses to their pets to
                    manufacture whatever product they wanted; it was changing. Their view had been
                    that whatever Bengalis think today the rest of India thinks tomorrow. But they
                    found it was the opposite, and they were interested in catching up
                    intellectually, no matter what they had thought or felt, they wanted to address
                    the issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the time you'd reached there had India made
                        adjustments? Gotten away from protectionism and the idea that everything had
                        to be done by the Indians themselves?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: What they called Nehruvian socialism very much reflected Gandhi's
                    principles, and was very much a post-colonial fixation. But, I got to India 50
                    years after that and members of the generation coming up just weren't
                    interested, they didn't have to fight that battle anymore.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But had the political powers in New Delhi changed the
                        rules?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0060" n="Page0060"/>
                <p>COLE: Yes, they had. Back when I was serving in Nepal they had had a terrible
                    gold crisis and they had had to change the rules right then and there. And
                    slowly but surely they were opening up. The symbolic way of talking about this
                    is Coca-Cola. At one point Coca-Cola was well-established in India. It's a ready
                    market when you think about people buying affordable luxuries like a cold Coke.
                    But then they were kicked out because they refused to give the government of
                    India their formula; at least that was the ostensible reason. When I was in
                    Calcutta they were back in and it was very nice to be able to cite the example
                    because everyone said, our local Colas are going to be run off the market. But
                    that didn't happen. Coca-Cola was smart and they bought up some of these and
                    kept on producing them. So the camel's nose was under the tent and the Indian
                    economy was beginning to open up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you use American entrepreneurs, the Coca-Cola
                        executives and others, as part of your program?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes. There were some people introducing a good American mattress, making it
                    someplace down in the south of India and I got one of their executives to come
                    on down and talk about how if you get an American company in your neighborhood,
                    it will make a contribution to the local dancing school and the music academy
                    and hire people. But there wasn't much of that. American businesspeople are
                    interested in business, not in going about giving talks. So occasionally we
                    could get somebody, but it wasn't so easy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Department of Commerce? Were they a partner
                        of yours or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: We had a little Department of Commerce office run by FSNs in Calcutta and
                    that was about it. But we did work closely with them and we did consult back and
                    forth with them and they would often send people to us. The Department of
                    Commerce's business is to sell U.S. products; it's not to help host country
                    nationals market their products in the U.S. So whenever somebody wandered into
                    their little library and said, I make industrial gloves and I want to know how I
                    can find a distributor in the U.S., they would say, go to USIS, see Ms. Cole.
                    And we'd get on the Internet and find a distributor in the U.S. for industrial
                    gloves. This distributor mainly didn't sell them in the U.S. but to other
                    countries where they were a very viable product.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the Internet. Had the Internet become a real
                        tool by the time you arrived there or while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>COLE: Yes, there were some wonderful entrepreneurial people in Calcutta working
                    on the Internet, including one Bengali. We had access in our library and it was
                    one of the reasons why we got large contributions from Indian firms doing
                    business in Calcutta. They found our access to the Internet and our researchers
                    useful. They also liked to present themselves as patrons of culture, and we put
                    up plaques behind the library check-out desk with the names of these great
                    business firms on them. The fact that they made significant donations helped us
                    save the library when others were being closed.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With Bengalis taking their culture very seriously, were
                        you able to provide them with examples of American culture?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: This was the last gasp of cultural programs for a long, long time. We had
                    pretty much stopped doing them. The last big exhibit we had was of the works of
                    an African America artist, Lawrence Jacob. The West Bengal government's minister
                    of culture came, the first time he had ever been in a USIS or U.S. government
                    facility. He happened to take an interest in African American art and he had an
                    uncle who had been a translated Langston Hughes. Our most successful program was
                    Ambassador Wisner's idea to bring the Paul Taylor Dance Company to India during
                    the celebration of its 50th anniversary. He raised almost all the money from, or
                    had us raise almost all the money, from private sector U.S. companies. Since
                    there weren't any in Calcutta, I raised our share from Indian companies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find Indians had much rapport with African
                        Americans?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes, there was a great deal of romanticization of the African American
                    experience. We sent a lot of Fulbright students to Howard University to study
                    African American literature and we did this in Bangladesh also. But, one of my
                    deputies, Terry White, had pointed out that this interest was declining among
                    the younger generation. They were less interested in the literature of
                    victimization and struggle and they wanted something different. So we started to
                    work with Asian American literature.</p>
                <p>One of the most interesting cultural events I did there was a seminar on American
                    literature and we also did a WorldNet conversation about African American
                    literature. And as I said, my district, in addition to heavily Bengali also
                    included Bihar, Orissa and what was called the Seven Sisters of the Northeast,
                    which were largely tribal areas. We had somebody talking about, Toni Morrison
                    and Maya Angelou and all my good Hindu participants were shocked at the fact
                    that women were having babies without having fathers. But this lovely tribal
                    woman with a Fulbright PhD got up and said, that exactly describes how my tribe
                    works. And there was this stunned silence. She was standing there, very pretty
                    in her little sari, explaining her tribe's matriarchal, matrilocal institutions.
                    It was great.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>Our other important policy emphasis was on disarmament issues. This, of course,
                    was the period of Indian nuclear testing. The Bengalis had always been peaceniks
                    and were always against any country being nuclear including us and themselves.
                    So there were a lot of demonstrations against Indian policy. I was always
                    writing cables and calling up New Delhi and saying, you have to include a little
                    paragraph pointing out that not all Indians were out in the streets clapping
                    their hands and celebrating the nuclear program. That in Bengal there was a huge
                    demonstration against the nuclear policy. At one point I was invited to speak at
                    a conference and the person on the other side was a retired Indian brigadier
                    general and I thought, what can I say? So I said, I can't discuss strategic
                    issues the way my friend the general can and I'm also constrained by the fact
                    that, as a foreign diplomat, I can't be critical of Indian policy; that's not my
                    business, that's your business. But I can tell you about growing up under the
                    shadow of the mushroom-shaped cloud. In New York City in the 1950s, we had dog
                    tags with our blood types on them and at school we had take cover drills, where
                    you would get under your desk or we'd go down to the basement and stand with our
                    hands on the wall. And, of course, we were smart children; we knew that if
                    somebody dropped an atomic bomb on us it would generate a gigantic tsunami that
                    would totally cover Brooklyn. Later on we had speakers come to our student
                    assembly to explain that we didn't have to be afraid, that we had minuteman
                    rockets that would shoot these evil things down because it was felt that our
                    fears were causing us great psychological damage. And so everyone was really
                    quite taken by this tale. And I said, now that India is nuclear, my question to
                    you is, are you having your children take cover drills? Do your children know
                    their blood types? And then I went into some statistics provided by an academic,
                    Steven Cohen who had done research on this, to point out that if there is a
                    nuclear exchange it will probably be in the north of India where the bases are.
                    And everyone went, whew. That would mean total nuclear contamination of the
                    Punjab. Where would the food come from? Millions and millions of people, many of
                    them very sick with radiation poisoning, will flood into the city. Where are
                    your hospitals where people are trained to treat radiation poisoning? This was
                    treated by the press as a very effective counter to the brigadier's
                    presentation, and indeed provided talking points that activists used against
                    this policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the decline of cultural diplomacy. When did
                        this start happening, why, and what were the effects?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>COLE: The principal proponent of the decline was Jesse Helms during the Clinton
                    administration. The main factors were economic. Our budgets were being cut and
                    cut and cultural programs are very expensive. There was also the argument, I
                    think a legitimate one, that in many countries as in Europe and Japan, cultural
                    activities were adequately available on a commercial basis. However, in large
                    parts of the world this was not the case. So we had to become very
                    entrepreneurial spending our own money to hire artists. We discovered there was
                    a whole culture of elite and upper middle class children studying piano in
                    Calcutta. In the tribal areas also were a lot of children in missionary
                    supported schools who were studying piano. So, if we could get a good pianist
                    who was also a good teacher we could do master classes in some remarkable places
                    and talk to people, some of whom were very hard for us to reach otherwise, about
                    something they cared about, which was their children's education. And it was
                    great at opening doors and keeping channels of communication open.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that the growing spread of international
                        television, CNN but other programs, make things easier or harder for you
                        all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: There was less of that penetration in Calcutta in my day. There were lots
                    and lots of little TV stations that serviced neighborhoods or districts. We were
                    working with them and you could really make friends forever if you did such
                    things as inviting them to come in with their cameras for a press conference
                    with the ambassador. Ambassador Celeste was great at this and had the
                    politician's genius for remembering people's names. So you could get the U.S.
                    ambassador on a channel that reached a couple of million people who would turn
                    it on because they were flattered by the attention. So, in that respect the
                    spread of TV was good for us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you feel there was particular tough competition from
                        outside? I mean, it always used to be the Soviets but that was way passed by
                        this point.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Most of the western powers who had had a diplomatic presence in Calcutta
                    had withdrawn. So we were left with the British Council, the Alliance Fran�aise,
                    a small Italian presence, and the Goethe Institute, which was very impressive.
                    The Japanese and the Thais had only a diplomatic presence there. We were more
                    inclined to work with these folks than against them. The Russians still had a
                    large presence there and had apartments in their compound they rented to
                    Indians. We had quite a nice relationship with them and we tried to complement
                    one another in our activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was the Monica Lewinsky scandal received there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>COLE: Indians know very well that their political leaders have their scandals too
                    but it would be unthinkable to dredge those up or dwell on them; it would simply
                    be bad manners. They were both amused and horrified by the fact that we were
                    giving all this attention to this relatively trifling affair. And mainly I was
                    lucky. It was unlike my case in Venezuela where, you know, we had to deal with
                    the fact that the president of the republic had a mistress. I was kind of
                    protected in this but I can remember any number of private conversations in
                    gatherings with Indian women, and they'd want to know what exactly had Clinton
                    done? I found ways to tip toe around this and I remember saying, most of you
                    went to convent schools and were educated by nuns. Weren't you required to read
                    the bible? And they said, oh yes. And I said, well, you know, our president says
                    that it wasn't sex; think about the bible; it was an abomination, not sex. That
                    indeed was our president's defense.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, to my mind, you know, I mean, this whole thing, the
                        way I was brought up sex meant one thing. It was heavy petting or- didn't
                        have the abomination but I could have very easily sworn I didn't have sex.
                        It was a very peculiar time in American politics. It was blown way out of
                        proportion.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Well, so I had to learn to tip toe, as I say, around this. And the ladies,
                    often at the end of the gathering, somebody would suddenly say, an abomination.
                    I know what he did. I said yes, and some of it involved a cigar. And they'd say,
                    “Wait until I tell my husband.” Later on at the club I would run into their
                    suited, booted, and felt-hatted, very correct husbands and they'd look at me and
                    chuckle and say, yes, my wife has explained it all to me.</p>
                <p>Then India Today, I believe it was, came out with a very frank article which
                    explained exactly what it is that these two people had been doing and that was
                    helpful. And if men ever asked me about it I said, oh, have your wife ask me.
                    I'm just too embarrassed to talk to you about it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've talked mostly about Calcutta and the Bengalis, were
                        you able to do much in the tribal areas?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: I managed to get to two tribal areas, Nagaland and Assam, both in
                    northeastern India which, next to Kashmir is the bloodiest place in India. Many
                    of the people there were in unadministered territories in the British era and
                    felt they should not have been incorporated into independent India in 1947. The
                    Nagas particularly with their warrior history had gone into immediate rebellion.
                    However, when I was in Calcutta, a truce was in effect. So I became the first
                    USIS officer since 1968 to go to Nagaland to do programs although my predecessor
                    had visited there with a group of British veterans of the Imphal campaign and
                    our Consul General had gone in under army escort - not exactly the most
                    appropriate way to visit the university.</p>
                <pb facs="0065" n="Page0065"/>
                <p>Getting into Nagaland required my FSN to get permission from the state capital.
                    We also had to negotiate with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to get the stamped
                    permission which we had to show at innumerable military road blocks. In the five
                    days we were permitted to stay, I was able to visit the university (which we had
                    not known existed) and revive some much earlier USIS contacts that had been long
                    forgotten.</p>
                <p>In Assam, the fighting was not against the Indian government but against the
                    state government or tribe against tribe. Because of the violence we had stopped
                    programming there in 1980. But I was able to get the cooperation of the local
                    tea planters and we were able to put on our first cultural program in many
                    years. It included a cowboy singer who was a great hit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, in '99, what did you do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: I had been assigned to go to Islamabad, Pakistan, as the Cultural Affairs
                    Officer. I had already had all my farewell parties in Calcutta. My apartment was
                    scheduled for major renovation. They were redoing each apartment as it emptied
                    out because it had sort of 1950s, '60s wiring and we all knew very well the
                    walls were going to start to smoke from the stuff we were plugging in. I also
                    had one entire wall in my bedroom that was weeping. I was ready to move to
                    Islamabad with my mother, who had Alzheimers, and my cat. The packers had
                    arrived.</p>
                <p>And low and behold the Clinton administration lobbed a bunch of Tomahawk missiles
                    at Osama Bin Laden's camp in Afghanistan. Our embassy in Pakistan was drawn
                    down; and the rest of us were frozen in place. After about two months I ended up
                    in New Delhi for another three months where I worked on nuclear disarmament
                    issues. We put on a big conference between New Delhi and Islamabad.</p>
                <p>Eventually they started letting people back into Islamabad and permission came
                    for me to go. We couldn't bring our families with us and I said, no, I can't go,
                    my mother has Alzheimer's, what am I going to do with her? They also started
                    cutting CAO positions. Fortunately, the PAO did protect that position and I was
                    able to go to Pakistan.</p>

                <p>COLE: When he came down to Calcutta he was wonderful. He was like a highly
                    charged naked wire. He had wonderful energy, wonderful creativity. I was very
                    glad that I was somewhat removed from daily contact with him because I think he
                    would have burned. He was a real professional; he had a million ideas. One of
                    these was a big conference in Calcutta on developing the economy in the eastern
                    side of the subcontinent. It was attended by representatives from industry, from
                    Bangladesh, eastern India, Nepal, as well as by U.S. speakers. This was his
                    idea. He's a real extrovert and he was great fun. He was wonderful with the
                    press and he loved a press feeding frenzy. And my FSN press chief was great at
                    setting these up. So as he was walking out of Ryder's Building, the state
                    capital where he'd been meeting with the top politicians in West Bengal we would
                    get all the press snapping photos and standing on desks and screaming and
                    carrying on and he just thought that was enormously amusing.</p>

                </p>
                <p>COLE: One of the things I did was reform the IV program. There were two problems
                    similar to those that had existed in India and had been addressed in reforms
                    made by Ann O'Leary which I took as my model. The first problem arose from the
                    fact that all elements of the embassy had a hand in making the nominations and
                    this could result in a good deal of blood on the table. The second was that the
                    nominations were made less with US policy objectives in mind than as rewards for
                    people who had been useful in one way or another. We took the Mission Program
                    Plan (MPP) and broke it down into goals in priority order and asked the
                    participants to select a goal and list their IV nominees under that goal in
                    priority order. We had 30 grants altogether and we were able to use ten of those
                    for the first of each of the participants. This kept the participants happy.
                    However, we did eliminate DEA's (Drug Enforcement Administration) first choice
                    because he had been to the U.S. two years earlier and so selected DEA's second
                    choice. Then we would proceed to start going down, going down the remaining
                    list.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Clinton visit, how did that work out from your
                        perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>COLE: Oh, it worked out wonderfully. But in the end it was a waste. Clinton
                    displayed a great deal of courage, he gave a great speech directly to the
                    Pakistani people explaining, thought not in so many words, that the Cold War was
                    over and that we no longer had to put up with their political nonsense; their
                    military dictatorships, their brutality to one another, their inter-communal
                    violence. That continued good relations would require changes in behavior. The
                    Pakistanis really got it; they understood what he was saying. But, unfortunately
                    the war on terrorism changed all that and now we're back to needing them and
                    have to put up with their political practices.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador while you were there? What part did
                        he play in public diplomacy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: That was Ambassador Milam. I felt the front office saw us as wayward
                    children in need of discipline. There was not much understanding of what public
                    diplomacy was and what it could do for us. There was one occasion we wanted to
                    give an IV grant to a member of a Muslim, but not a fundamentalist group but as
                    far as the DCM was concerned this was pandering. But I argued that we didn't
                    have a choice. People like this are representative of Pakistan and if we don't
                    nominate some of them it will look bad. That was the argument I used that
                    worked. But it required steady ongoing pounding.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you find Pakistani society was difficult to work
                        with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes, it was. First of all, you're posted in Islamabad, which is a sort of
                    Brasilia-like invented city. It's a beautiful city, but it is not in South Asia.
                    It isn't until you go 20 minutes away to Pindi that you actually enter South
                    Asia. In Islamabad you're talking to an extremely small group of extremely
                    westernized people. In Karachi and Lahore, to the extent that we still have them
                    there, our people are talking to people with real power and real authority. In
                    Islamabad we were just talking to an extremely small set of political
                    opportunists and military officers. They viewed using guile as necessary for a
                    small country to survive. I don't think I've ever been lied to so much. Indians
                    didn't tell you lies; they were proud of what they'd achieved and they would
                    step up to it. Pakistanis were in a different situation and so they would stick
                    to their guns and tell you that, no, no, no, no, this was an indigenous uprising
                    in Kashmir.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was there anything cultural that you could do in the
                        short time you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes. One program in particular involved an American dance group led by a
                    Korean-American named Dana Tai Soon. His group had a Kennedy Center grant to do
                    a dance based on Alexander the Great. He applied to us for a grant that would
                    take him to the site of Alexander's campaigns. We were ale to fund the trip with
                    support from Air Pakistan, the Ministry of Tourism and the Ministry of Culture,
                    Sports, and Religion.</p>
                <pb facs="0068" n="Page0068"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you have the feeling that, particularly in
                        Pakistan, this very strong fundamentalist force within Islamic society made
                        it almost impenetrable?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: No, nothing is impenetrable, nothing. You can always get a book translation
                    program going and send people a book in Urdu. Everybody likes a book. And
                    everybody especially likes a book when it's followed up by a visit from a young
                    lady of quality. In your community you don't see women other than your wife, but
                    you'd certainly like to get a glimpse of that American girl, you know, and you
                    really like your book, and you may come to the presentation in your party
                    headquarters, or mosques. There's always a pathway; we just have to spend the
                    time and the energy to find it. And we also have to respect the whole concept of
                    keeping the channels of communication open. We're not necessarily promoting a
                    specific program; we're not targeting what we're doing that specifically. We're
                    just finding out who is friendly in this essentially hostile environment. We're
                    finding out who can be seen in public with us. We're letting somebody over there
                    with a child who wants to go to school in the U.S. know who it is they can call
                    We're building bridges that other people may walk across at a later point. That
                    was something that would seem particularly difficult to get across in Pakistan.
                    Of course, people were scared to death and for good reason. It was a very
                    dangerous environment. And there was also an argument that had some validity
                    that public opinion did not matter in Pakistan. And I argued it depends on how
                    you define public. We need to find lots of ways to be seen in public with the
                    Pakistani military that won't embarrass us or that won't imply that we approve
                    of what they're doing but will keep them friendly, keep them open, let them know
                    who we are, whom they can talk to and who does what over here. But since it
                    wasn't political or economic reporting it didn't seem as worthwhile.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why were you evacuated?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: I was evacuated because I had became very ill, increasingly so. I returned
                    only briefly to pack out and collect my mother, my cat, and my effects and bring
                    them back to the U.S.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened after you returned to the U.S.?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Well, for a long time while I was undergoing medical treatment they found
                    me a make work job in a personnel office where I was able to do very little. But
                    when I was feeling better one of the things that I did for this office was to
                    staff a promotion panel, the one that took people from FS-2 to FS-1. And that
                    was fascinating because I really got to see how promotion panels worked.
                    Wow.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's something. I've done this; it's an interesting
                        process but really, it works.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Yes. Yes, you know, we didn't do too badly in ours. The whole low ranking
                    requirement is, I think unnecessary and counterproductive and produces some
                    falseness. But on the whole we did, I think, alright with ours.</p>
                <p>Then I put a bid in and got a posting in WHA/PDA, Western Hemisphere Affairs
                    Public Diplomacy, where I was the policy and program coordinator. I did that for
                    two years and then I retired.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say policy and program officer, what do you
                        mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: That was a combination that WHA/PDA really liked. It was a combination of
                    the old policy officers who dealt with media and the program officers who
                    negotiated with the offices involved in the IV (international visitors) program:
                    how many visitors did a country get; how many private sector grants; what about
                    the ambassador's fund. All of this has to be negotiated out and there's usually
                    an officer that did this sort of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is your first real taste of the new Foreign Service,
                        wasn't it? From your perspective, how did the amalgamation of USIA into the
                        State Department work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Well, I was very fortunate in being in WHA/PDA where it worked better than
                    I think it worked elsewhere. I think that was a product of the people involved:
                    Betsy Whittaker, who was WHA/PDA's director and the various deputy assistant
                    secretaries in Western Hemisphere Affairs. One of them was Otto Reich. He had
                    been ambassador in Venezuela and he understood what public diplomacy could do
                    and respected it. And indeed public diplomacy worked much better in Western
                    Hemisphere Affairs; in many ways it's an easier environment. Folks in the
                    Western Hemisphere are more like us than they aren't. They're more like us,
                    certainly than the Chinese or the Iraqis. So it was a somewhat easier
                    environment for amalgamation. On the whole, though, I think it's too bad; as an
                    independent agency we had more clout in many ways.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You've had a very interesting, fine career. How did you
                        feel about it? Did you enjoy it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>COLE: Oh, I felt wonderful about it and I was extremely sad to retire, especially
                    since I'd got promoted to an OC, so I was finally in a position to be able to
                    affect policy or to use my authority for some purpose. Unfortunately, though, my
                    health wouldn't allow me to continue; I simply couldn't work that hard anymore
                    and remember that much and care that much. So I retired.</p>
