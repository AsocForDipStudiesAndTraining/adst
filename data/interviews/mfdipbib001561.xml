                <p>AMBASSADOR HENRY ALLEN HOLMES</p>
                <p>Interviewed by: Charles Stuart Kennedy</p>
                <p>Initial interview date: March 9, 1999</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is March 9, 1999. This is an interview with Henry
                        Allen Holmes. This is being done on behalf of the Association for Diplomatic
                        Studies and Training, and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Allen, I want to start
                        with the beginning. Could you tell me when and where you were born and then
                        something about your parents?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I was born the day that Hitler became chancellor of Germany, January 31,
                    1933, in Bucharest, Rumania, at the American legation, where my dad, Julius
                    Cecil Holmes, was the charg� at the time. He was the number two guy in a two-guy
                    legation, and the night that I was born he was getting phone calls from Foreign
                    Service colleagues all over Western Europe wondering what the king of Rumania's
                    move was going to be now that Hitler had become chancellor of Germany.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you and Hitler sort of rose to power at the same
                        time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Be careful in this interview. We have the same initials - A. H.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you tell me a bit about the background of your
                        father and the background of your mother, please?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: My mother and father were both born and raised in Kansas. They went to
                    Kansas University in Lawrence, Kansas, where my dad spent most of his life
                    growing up. After the Rogers Act was passed-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1924.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>HOLMES: -in 1925, establishing a competitive way of entering the Foreign Service,
                    my father was one of the first - in fact, I believe he was in the first group
                    that took the exam - passed, and entered the first class of the Foreign Service
                    in 1925 and then had assignments in Marseilles - he learned to speak very good
                    French - where one day in the consulate there was a Sacco-Vanzetti riot in front
                    of the consulate. Somebody threw a grenade, it went under the desk, the grenade
                    was a dud, fortunately. Subsequently he had assignments in Tirana, Albania, and
                    Smyrna, which is today Izmir in Turkey-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It would have been under Turkey, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: It was in Turkey, but-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Not too long after the exodus of Greeks.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: But it was still called Smyrna at the time. Then his next assignment was
                    in Bucharest, Rumania, and while there he married my mother, in Kansas, and they
                    both returned to post together.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your mother's background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: My mother was also a Kansan, and actually it was kind of interesting. She
                    was from Wichita, and she had met my father at the Kansas University, but where
                    I guess he sought her out more was when her father, who after World War I was
                    governor of Kansas for a couple of terms. In about 1921 or 1922, I can't recall
                    the date exactly, there was a very severe winter, and the American Federation of
                    Labor, Samuel Gompers' federation, struck - the miners struck - and there were
                    some fatalities. There was not enough coal to heat various establishments,
                    including old people's homes and hospitals, and there were some fatalities. So
                    my grandfather, after talking with the labor union, called out the national
                    guard to mine enough coal to fuel those establishments, and my dad was in the
                    Kansas national guard and was one of the people who was called out to
                    participate in this operation - which led to an early attempt at labor
                    legislation well ahead of Taft-Hartley, called the Kansas Industrial Court Act,
                    and my grandfather supported it all the way. It was sustained in the Kansas
                    Supreme Court, went to the Supreme Court of the United States and was declared
                    unconstitutional by a vote of five to four, with Taft casting the deciding vote
                    against it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is William Howard Taft.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>HOLMES: William Howard Taft. My grandfather and he battled within the Republican
                    Party. My grandfather was a progressive and a Bullmooser and had a very
                    strong-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Any connection with William Allen White and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: William Allen White was my grandfather's best friend, and they were
                    editors and publishers together in Kansas. William Allen White had the Emporia
                    Gazette, which was very well known, and my grandfather, after working his way up
                    from being a war correspondent in the Spanish-American War and representing
                    small Kansas newspapers, eventually arrived in Wichita and bought and developed
                    the Wichita Beacon. He and White were very close friends, a long-time
                    friendship.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, also, too, White was a Republican and a Bullmooser
                        and the whole nine yards.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, he and my grandfather went off to World War I together representing
                    the Kansas Red Cross and the Kansas... I think it was the Salvation Army, but
                    representing two organizations. They went off together. William Allen White
                    wrote a book about it called The Martial Adventures of Henry and Me, and they
                    had an interesting time in France visiting the Kansas national guard, and then
                    my grandfather came back. I guess my grandfather stayed on briefly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your grandfather's name.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Henry Justin Allen. He came back, and William Allen White placed his name
                    in nomination for governor of Kansas, and he won by acclamation. He never made a
                    campaign speech. It is kind of unusual.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, can you tell about growing up as a Foreign Service
                        kid?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes. We didn't stay in Rumania. As I said, I was born in 1933. We didn't
                    stay there very long after my birth - about five months. We returned to the
                    United States, returned to Washington, where my father then became the assistant
                    chief of protocol in a two-man political office that also had responsibility for
                    international conferences and international aviation, and had that job for a
                    number of years, until late in the '30s, probably 1938 or late '37, when he left
                    the Foreign Service, took a job as vice president of the New York World's Fair,
                    which was being organized at that time.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Grover Whelan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Grover Whelan was the sort of head guy, and my dad was responsible for
                    negotiating the various bilateral agreements with those nations that would have
                    pavilions at the New York World's Fair.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that bring you up to New York?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: That brought us to New York. We lived in New York for a couple of years,
                    and then he stayed with the Fair, and then when the Fair was over, my father
                    accepted a job as a vice president of General Mills and went off for a stint as
                    their representative in Brazil. I used to kid him about selling Wheaties to the
                    Brazilians. While there, World War II started. The Japanese bombed Pearl Harbor,
                    and my father came back. He had kept up his reserve commission in the Army since
                    World War I, was a major, and within a week he was on duty at the Joint Chiefs
                    of Staff in the Pentagon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where did you go to elementary school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I went to school in a number of places. I went to a school for a couple
                    of years while my parents were at the World's Fair, a school called the Buckley
                    School in New York City. Then I went out to Wichita, Kansas. We were there for a
                    year, and I went to elementary school there in Wichita. Then when my parents
                    went to Brazil, I went to a little military school in Tennessee, a place called
                    Bloomington Springs, Tennessee, and then when they came back when the war
                    started and my father went back in the Army, we came back to Washington, and I
                    went to St. Alban's School there from the fifth through the eighth grade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, particularly, what about St. Alban's School there.
                        You went there when it would be about, what, 1942 or so?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: '42, that's correct. Yes, from the fall of '42 to the spring of '46.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, St. Alban's, of course, is a Washington institution.
                        Could you talk about what you got out of it, the school there, and your
                        impressions?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I had a great time at the school. It was academically rigorous,
                    which was good for me. I remember starting Latin pretty early. In those days it
                    was unusual. I studied Latin there in the seventh grade, and the usual courses
                    of study that one followed. I played football and enjoyed that immensely,
                    baseball, played soccer, liked sports, and I liked to sing. I sang in the choir,
                    glee club at St. Alban's.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about reading? Were there any books that grabbed you
                        at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I remember reading a lot of adventure books. I liked adventure
                    stories, but I liked books about musicians, too, because at the time, I was very
                    interested in music. In fact, I was taking piano lessons, even went to a piano
                    camp in Vermont one summer, and that was a lot of fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about World War II? You were fairly young, but for a
                        lot of people - I'm about five years older than you are, so I was more
                        engaged, but talk about adventure stories, this was the great adventure
                        story, reading every day of where things are doing. Were you old enough to
                        have this - your father, or course was involved - have an impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, I have very strong memories of World War II, primarily because my
                    father was overseas, and my mother and I and my sister and my very young brother
                    all lived together in Washington, on 21st Street, and she missed him a lot, and
                    so did we. We were able to track him when he was in North Africa, although she
                    didn't share information with us, but my mother and father had honeymooned in
                    North Africa, and of course, officers censored their own letters, which he did,
                    dutifully, but he would refer to events on their honeymoon, so my mother pretty
                    much tracked him during that stage, because he was in Europe the entire period
                    during World War II with Eisenhower. He participated in a rather famous military
                    event in preparing for Operation Torch, which was the Anglo-American invasion of
                    North Africa. Algeria was still under Vichy France, and the object of this
                    special mission, which was led by Mark Clark, Lyman Lemnitzer - my father was on
                    it - and Gerald Wright.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Captain Gerald Wright, whom I've interviewed, by the
                        way.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0006" n="Page0006"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Captain Jerry Wright was the skipper of the submarine that took them off
                    of Algeria. How it was conceived was, Robert Murphy was the American consul in
                    Algiers, and he had a number of vice consuls who were also intelligence
                    gatherers. One of them was Ridgway Knight, who was in the Foreign Service and
                    later became ambassador one or two times, a very good friend of my dad's. The
                    object of this mission was basically to persuade the French Army in North Africa
                    not to resist the Anglo-American landings in North Africa. Murphy and his vice
                    consuls had been scouting out officers in the French Army who were sympathetic
                    to the allied cause, and they had found some. They arranged a meeting in a
                    deserted farmhouse at a place called Cherchel, which was outside of Algiers, and
                    Eisenhower sent Clark and the team - there were five of them - to go in and talk
                    with these officers. So they went in the submarine, they surfaced the first
                    night, they flashed a signal, they received no response, so they went back down
                    and sat on the bottom till the next day. They came up the second night, and this
                    time they did get a reply, and they went ashore, each one in a two-man kayak
                    with a British commando. My father was the first one ashore and the last one off
                    because he spoke pretty close to bilingual French, and they figured he could
                    fade into the landscape, although they were very careful to wear their uniforms
                    so they wouldn't be treated as spies if caught. They met with these French
                    officers; they came to an understanding, which was good. They were raided by the
                    Vichy police towards the end of their discussions. They repaired to the wine
                    cellar to hide. The police did not search the wine cellar. When they left, the
                    American party came up and hastily beat it for the beach. The Vichy police came
                    back, realizing they hadn't searched the wine cellar, and there was kind of a
                    scramble to get off. The surf had come up. They lost equipment.</p>

                        wait and go out, I think, on the sixth wave or something. Anyway, there's a
                        technique for getting through some heavy surf.</hi>

                <p>HOLMES: So that was a pretty exciting thing, and so obviously after that became
                    public knowledge, that fired my own imagination. I followed the war. I can
                    remember collecting Time Magazine covers of general and admirals, and I also
                    remember being a doodler in school - you know how kids draw things. I doodled on
                    the edge of my book a swastika because it was a kind of an intriguing symbol,
                    and I remember my father came back during the war - actually I didn't know it a
                    the time, but he was carrying the invasion plans for Normandy and had come in
                    out of a remote airfield in Scotland and crossed over and went, of course,
                    straight to Marshall with the invasion plans and spent a few days with us. He
                    asked me about my studies, and I showed him my books, and he saw that swastika.
                    I can remember him treating me like an enemy. Somehow I was a traitor. He was
                    really quite shocked at this symbol of infamy that I had doodled on my book.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did you graduate from St. Alban's in '46 or
                        what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I graduated from the lower school, through the eighth grade, and
                    then I went to St. Paul's School in Concord, New Hampshire, where I spent two
                    years. Then my father - the war was, of course, over - had come back. It's
                    probably an interesting footnote if it's part of the Foreign Service story - he
                    actually served most of the war as Eisenhower's deputy chief of staff for
                    military government and civil affairs, in those days known as G-5. He was a
                    brigadier general at the time, and his boss was a Canadian British officer, a
                    lieutenant general named Grasset, but he was basically Eisenhower's civil
                    affairs-military government guy and really set up... I hadn't realized at the
                    time that he really was probably the father of modern civil affairs in the
                    United States Army. I didn't realize it until I came to the job I had in the
                    Pentagon five years ago, and people in my office presented me with an Army
                    history of civil affairs in World War II, with tabs on all the documents my
                    father had written, and I really had had no clue until that time. Civil Affairs
                    had become part of Special Operations, so that's how I got into that. It's kind
                    of a wonderful closure of the circle. But anyway, my father did that, and
                    basically set up the military government in Italy, worked with the British to
                    set up a little piece of sovereign Italian soil over in Bari, the spur on the
                    Italian boot, and then later worked on the aftermath of the invasion of France,
                    the object being to restore French sovereignty in the hands of the Gaullist Free
                    French as rapidly as possible. He was very careful working with the British to
                    ensure that when allied troops, beginning in Normandy, went through parts of
                    France that they never took the key of the city, accepted municipal authority,
                    for themselves, but always ensured that there was a Free French officer there
                    who received the authority - so there would be a very rapid restoration of
                    sovereignty, looking obviously to the aftermath of the war.</p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>A couple of things that my father did that were quite interesting: one, the
                    French, of course, wanted to be the first to liberate Paris, and they didn't
                    have enough tanks, so on behalf of LeClerc, of the famous Deuxi�me Blind�
                    (Second Division), my dad went to see Bedell Smith and Eisenhower and prevailed
                    on them to get some Sherman tanks for LeClerc, to the displeasure of George
                    Patton. But that was one thing he did. Another thing he did was, he was into
                    Paris within a couple hours after our forces went in - my father was - and he
                    was approached by the prefect of police of Paris, who said that they were in
                    danger of being beaten by the Communist resistance and that his forces didn't
                    have any weapons, and so my dad produced somehow about 20,000 carbines and
                    pistols for them within hours, and they were quickly distributed, and the police
                    were able to establish control in key posts in the city. These are kind of
                    little vignettes.</p>
                <p>During that period, my father, because of his diplomatic experience and his
                    fluent French, was used by Eisenhower in London as his sort of senior conveyor
                    of messages to De Gaulle, usually bad news. So he spent a lot of time going over
                    to De Gaulle's headquarters and discussing such things as how they would set up
                    administration in France after we went in and what kind of currency to use. The
                    civil affairs people had printed up scrip, both paper money and stamps, to use
                    in France until such time as French administration could reestablish their
                    authorities and procedures and so forth. Well, De Gaulle was absolutely aghast
                    at the idea and was totally opposed to the idea of phony money printed in
                    America to be used as currency in his country, so he refused. My father looked
                    him in the eye and said, “Well, my General, if that's the case, then we have no
                    choice but to use greenbacks.” That changed his demeanor very quickly, and he
                    said, “Yes, we'll use the scrip, but for a very limited time, until the French
                    mint can begin to turn out francs.” But anyway, there were a lot of-</p>

                        come back from a NATO meeting, and that's what he always said when he came
                        home steaming about something. Were you picking up anything, when you saw
                        your father early on, about the French or De Gaulle?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, well, the French were extremely difficult, and De Gaulle was a
                    remarkable man. I mean, by a superhuman feat of chutzpah, he basically swam
                    against the tides of history and was a thorn in the sides of both Churchill and
                    Roosevelt, and Churchill and Roosevelt would communicate with each other, “Well,
                    yesterday I met General De Gaulle, and he was bearing the cross of Lorraine, in
                    contrast to the earlier meeting when he thought he was the reincarnation of Joan
                    of Arc.” I mean these kinds of acerbic comments about General De Gaulle. My
                    father had deep respect for him, and spoke up for him with Eisenhower and Smith,
                    but always in the context of ensuring the rapid restoration of French
                    sovereignty, France's participation not so much in the war but in the aftermath
                    of the war, because already my father and others could see what the Soviets were
                    doing, and were very, very concerned about the strength and the direction of the
                    French Communist movement. They were determined to install De Gaulle's people
                    rapidly so as to ensure that France would be on the right side when the war
                    ended.</p>

                    even hearing about him. It was only afterwards, many years later, that I became
                    aware of Doug MacArthur and, of course, his time when he was ambassador in
                    Japan. But during the war I have no recollection whatsoever.</p>

                <pb facs="0010" n="Page0010"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I was there the first two years before I left for a year. I left
                    for a year when my father went back into the Foreign Service in 1948. He was
                    persuaded... I left out one important part here, that just a few months before
                    the end of the war in Europe, Stettinius had become Secretary of State, and
                    Roosevelt asked Eisenhower to release my father from his staff to come back to
                    the State Department and be assistant secretary for the Foreign Service. His
                    colleagues were Archibald MacLeish and Dean Acheson, and it was a very small
                    structure. But the idea was to get an experienced Foreign Service officer who
                    also had this very rich political-military experience in World War II with
                    Eisenhower to come back and help organize the Foreign Service for a major
                    expansion to meet the needs of the postwar period when clearly the United States
                    would inherit the responsibilities of empire, you know, of the British and the
                    French, and it was not set up, in terms of its own diplomatic cadres, to do the
                    job. My dad was brought back, and he and Selden Chapin, who was then, I think,
                    director general of the Foreign Service, wrote the 1946 Foreign Service Act and
                    helped set that up. My father stayed throughout that period and then went into
                    business when the war was over, and then in 1948 the Department, which was
                    expanding, asked him to come back, to be reinstated, as a Foreign Service
                    officer with an enormous leap in promotion. When my dad had left in the late 30s
                    he had been a Foreign Service officer class 8-D or something, because in the
                    Depression years there were just no promotions. He came back into the Foreign
                    Service as a Foreign Service officer class 1, and was immediately assigned as
                    deputy chief of mission in London, in 1948. I took off a year from St. Paul's
                    and went to what we would call a preparatory school but what the British would
                    call a public school, a secondary school called Wellington College. I went to
                    this college because the Duke of Wellington, Arthur Wellesley, had been a
                    lieutenant colonel on my dad's staff in civil affairs and recommended the
                    school. I spent a year there and then returned to St. Paul's for my sixth form
                    through my final year.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: Yes, that was quite a contrast for me. The curriculum didn't quite match,
                    and so I was out of phase. I had been a pretty good student. I'd been as sort of
                    B+ student during my first two years at St. Paul's, and at Wellington I had a
                    hard time because I turned sixteen during the year there, and everybody was
                    preparing for... In those days, it was called the School Certificate. I think
                    today they're called your... I can't remember whether it's A Levels or O

                <p>HOLMES: Yes, the Oxford-Cambridge test for all these kids, and you had to take it
                    in eight subjects. I, interestingly, more than held my own in history and
                    English and French and “divvers” - divinity, sacred studies - because I'd been
                    to a church school, of course, in the United States. But I was average in Latin
                    - I was a little bit behind in Latin - and I was not good in science. I had
                    never had any science. Chemistry and physics were two of the courses that you
                    had to take. Bottom line - at the end of the year, I took the exams. In order to
                    pass you had to pass in five of eight subjects. I passed in four, so I didn't
                    make it. But I had a great year. I played rugby, did cross-country running,
                    played cricket. I just thoroughly enjoyed the year - and was a member of the
                    Combined Cadet Force. I was a corporal.</p>

                    kinds of kids who were in that school were and the kinds of kids that I'd been
                    to school with in the United States, but there were two major differences.

                    cubicle studying with two pairs of socks on, long johns, mittens, wool cap over
                    my head. I took the mittens off to write notes, it was that cold. Then the
                    rations were very meager. Lend-Lease had ended. The kids had a very, very meager
                    diet there. I can remember at breakfast we had pasta. We had spaghetti for
                    breakfast. We got one slice of meat a week, one egg a week, one candy bar a
                    month. I remember the Kit-Kat candy bar. I got that once a month. For kids that
                    were 16 or over, to sort of give them a little bit more diet, they got a sort of
                    a quarter of a pint of beer on Saturday night, which was unusual. But the
                    rations were meager. I remember losing 20 pounds or so. We had a lot of bread,

                    other thing was the military aspect. That's where I had my first personal
                    connection with the military. In World War II, the British had formed the
                    Combined Cadet Force, which was to be Britain's last line of defense, their
                    final reserves, because at a time when they thought that Hitler would invade
                    Britain, they took kids that were just below the age of enlistment, 15 and 16
                    year olds. I think 17 was the age that you could join the armed forces, but 15
                    and 16 year olds were organized into a Combined Cadet Force in British schools
                    and were given basic small-arms instruction, in using the Enfield and Sten gun
                    and Brenn gun, small unit tactics, how to man a defensive position with
                    cross-cutting fields of fire. I mean it was quite something. We drilled several
                    times a week, and we had military games with other schools. I mean we had a
                    great field day against Eton College, and umpires from Sandhurst, which was the
                    West Point of the British Army, would come over and instruct us in military
                    tactics and then monitor the war games that we had with other colleges. That was
                    a fascinating experience and was certainly a major - I would say the major -
                    difference in attitude on the part of schoolboys in England and the States,
                    because they were still very close... I mean, 1948 was when the war was barely
                    over, and so the whole wartime atmosphere of a nation that had been bombed
                    severely, that was very close to being invaded by the enemy, so it was a very
                    different attitude, a very different ambience with respect to military affairs
                    than was my experience in the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can remember at the height of the war, around '42,
                        '43... Wait, I'm a little stuck.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>You were mentioning your experience of the British school system and their
                    defense thing. I just have to add, just to give a social contrast, I was going
                    to a prep school called Kent in the middle of the war, and all of us young males
                    were expecting to go to the military, and I think probably almost all did at one
                    point, but I think this was around 1942 or '43, they decided it would be a good
                    idea for us to learn close-order drill, and we came out with paper hats, cocked
                    hats, and broomsticks, and it was such a fiasco that we didn't have any. That's
                    the American approach to it. We all learned about drill, but not in the serious
                    way that the British did.</p>
                <p>Well, while you were at Wellington and St. Paul's, were you thinking of the
                    Foreign Service at all?</p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, I wasn't thinking of the Foreign Service at all, as a career. In
                    fact, I really didn't seriously think about the Foreign Service as a career
                    until about 1955-56, when I was serving in the Marine Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, we'll pick this up. Did you go to our embassy
                        in London, where your father was, much, and what were your impressions of
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0013" n="Page0013"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, I would go up for holidays, I mean for Christmas holiday and then
                    the spring holiday I went home. My dad was in the DCM's residence there. On one
                    occasion I met Winston Churchill, whom dad had asked to be the speaker at the
                    Pilgrim Society dinner that year, and that was a big thrill. I went into a
                    little side room and chatted with him. He asked me about my school and talked a
                    little bit about my dad because my dad had had a lot of contact with him, both
                    in World War II and afterwards, because my father was deputy chief of mission in
                    London for five years, from '48 to '53, with three political ambassadors. He
                    pretty much ran the place because he knew all the senior British, which was the
                    reason that he was asked to go there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you picking up any reverberations of what by '48
                        became the Cold War while you were at school or from your father?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0014" n="Page0014"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, certainly from my father I was picking up a lot. I had an
                    interesting experience during the spring break of '49. At that point I should
                    mention that our embassy in London was a huge embassy. It was organized almost
                    like a small outpost of the Department of State. We had counselors in charge of
                    German affairs, in charge of Italian affairs, in charge of colonial affairs - I
                    mean, it was a tremendous organization there. There was a German expert named
                    Bill Trimble, a Foreign Service officer who was a Germanist, and at that point
                    we were looking at revising the Occupation Statute for Germany. So my father
                    sent Bill Trimble on a mission to go and talk to our political advisor, or
                    pol-ad in Berlin, who was a man named Bernard Guffler. He managed to get me a
                    seat on the airplane as his briefcase carrier. I was 16 years old. It was a
                    fascinating experience. We went over to Germany. We went to Heidelberg, spent
                    the night there, and the next day we went to Berlin on the famous Berlin
                    Airlift, when the aircraft were landing about every 30 seconds at Tempelhof. We
                    were buzzed on the way up by a Soviet MIG, and I remember the pilot asking
                    everybody to check under their bucket seats to make sure that their parachutes
                    were there, and I was the only one who didn't have a parachute. That kind of
                    caught my attention. We landed at Tempelhof. We were met by Bernard Guffler, and
                    the first thing we did was to go over into the Soviet Sector. We had, or course,
                    a car with diplomatic plates; we all had diplomatic passports. We drove over
                    into the Soviet Sector. The German driver was very nervous. I remember that
                    clearly. We went quite deeply in, probably 30 blocks or so, and at a certain
                    point we turned down a street and there was a Soviet military headquarters on
                    that street. Immediately, a mobile patrol came up and pulled us over to the
                    side, and I noticed that the jeep was American and the weapons were British,
                    because I through my Combined Cadet Force I recognized that they were basically
                    Sten guns that they had. Soviet soldiers pulled us over and made us get out,
                    checked our passports, took my Brownie camera and smashed it with a rifle butt,
                    just destroyed it. The German driver was sweating profusely. He didn't have a
                    diplomatic passport, and they talked to us for a few minutes and finally, when
                    they recognized that these were diplomatic passports, they let us go. But what
                    struck me about the Cold War was the extraordinary destruction in Berlin. I can
                    remember in both the western sectors as well as in the Soviet Sector, the rubble
                    was so extensive, that they kept piling it higher, running little railroad
                    tracks up in the mounds of rubble that were sometimes two stories high, pushing
                    these carts up so that they could stack the rubble even higher, and people -
                    displaced people, homeless refugees - were digging in the bottom of these mounds
                    of rubble to carve out little caves. They would string a string of light bulbs
                    into the cave, so that was the only thing that they had, or a cot or whatever
                    they could put together to survive. I mean the conditions were really
                    depressing, so primitive, and these people were really having a hard time. So I
                    became starkly aware of the destruction of World War II and also very much of
                    the Soviet role in the aftermath of World War II, because they clearly were...
                    We were in the middle of the Berlin Airlift, and they were giving us a hard
                    time. So it came home to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Your father, obviously, was an extremely busy person, but
                        I was wondering whether the rest of your family, were there sort of dinner
                        table conversations about whither American policy or what we were doing or
                        anything like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0015" n="Page0015"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, absolutely. There was a lot of dinner table conversation, in the
                    family and also friends and officials who came through. Yes, the conversation
                    was constant, I would say, about what was going on, because not only in the
                    family but there were a lot of officials and friends and people coming through,
                    and so it was pretty much of a continuous diet of foreign policy questions.
                    Another thing my father was working on at the time was the Trieste Agreement,
                    for example. And a lot about the Soviets. I remember just before my father left
                    the State Department in 1946, I think it was, the Katyn Forest Massacre had come
                    to light.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was in Poland. We might explain what it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: That was the massacre of the Polish officer corps in the Katyn Forest,
                    and there were two versions as to who the perpetrators had been. One was that
                    the Nazis had done it, and the other was that the Soviets had done it. As it
                    turned out, I think history bears out that it was a Soviet operation, but having
                    come from Eisenhower's staff, my father was interviewed by J. Edgar Hoover
                    himself on the Katyn Forest Massacre.</p>
                <p>Anyway, I would say that during that whole period it was a very clear focus on
                    the cold war and what the Soviets were up to, and certainly the dinner table
                    conversation was full of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in '49 you came back to the States?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: In '49 I came back. I went back to St. Paul's School in the fall of 1949
                    for my final year there and graduated at the end of the year, in 1950. I won a
                    naval ROTC scholarship, and I had an opportunity to go to either Harvard or
                    Princeton and I chose Princeton, entered as a midshipman on that scholarship
                    program in the fall of 1950.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I continued singing, doing glee club and choir singing, but I had stopped
                    studying the piano because St. Paul's didn't have a fine arts program in those
                    days. They do now, but it was a very-</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, pretty austere, and I also was working very hard in my final year to
                    get the best possible grades that I could so that I could get into a good
                    college.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I graduated in '54. I was there for four years.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: In June of 1950.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: -and McCarthyism was beginning to show it's... It was the
                        high period of McCarthyism. What did you get out of that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: We were very much aware of the McCarthy period, and of course I heard...
                    Not only on the campus were we very much opposed to McCarthy, in fact, McCarthy
                    tried to send investigators to Princeton - no, seriously, there was a move made
                    to send some Senate investigators to interview faculty members, graduate
                    students, and Princeton refused by a unanimous decision of the trustees and the
                    faculty. There was a certain amount of demonstrating on the campus about it,
                    too. Knowing that this was going on and strong opposition to McCarthyism or to
                    any of his people so much as setting foot on the campus, and so they were
                    rebuffed. I remember in my final year at Princeton, a lot of us watched the
                    McCarthy hearings, and I also heard a lot about it from the family, because
                    there was a McCarthy plant in the State Department in the Personnel Division
                    called Scott McLeod, who was digging around in the cellars for information about
                    people who possibly were disloyal, and that was something that I heard a lot
                    about from my father because my father felt very strongly that the
                    Administration did not oppose McCarthy strongly enough. He went and had a
                    personal very strong conversation with John Foster Dulles about it, but in
                    particular he was speaking up for two Foreign Service officers who were Chinese
                    experts-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John Stewart Service was one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: John Stewart Service, and John Carter Vincent was the other one.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: But it's John Stewart Service, I remember, that my father knew very well,
                    felt he was really outraged by the treatment that he was subjected to, and went
                    and talked to Dulles personally and privately in his office about him and about
                    what was happening to the Department and how it was really important for the
                    Administration to stand up and protect the professional career Foreign Service.
                    So I was very much aware of that period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was very much a feeling at the time that Eisenhower
                        and Dulles were not standing up. Actually, Truman's role was not so great on
                        this loyalty business either. He started the loyalty hearings. It was a very
                        difficult time. Your father, when he came back from London, where did he
                        go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: When my father came back from London, he worked for a while for Dulles.
                    At a certain point my father was indicted by a grand jury in New York for, along
                    with a member of Congress from Massachusetts, the University of Chicago, a group
                    of people who had in the immediate aftermath of World War II bought some surplus
                    tankers and had basically organized a company which had a complete IRS review
                    before they went into business, and it was all above board, they were doing
                    well, and it was one of the activities in my father's private life between the
                    war and when he went back into the Foreign Service. He invested a little bit of
                    money into it - I don't know, $10,000 or something - and then when he decided to
                    go back into the Foreign Service in 1948, he obviously resigned as an officer of
                    this tanker corporation and he ended up just being a stockholder along with
                    others. Subsequently, about two years later, the tankers were sold to some
                    company, and then eventually one or two of the tankers ended up being purchased
                    by the Chinese Government, and that led to a big investigation. During the
                    Eisenhower Administration, Herbert Brownell was the attorney general, and the
                    government went into court and got an indictment against all these people,
                    including my father, which was very strange because he was a simple stockholder
                    and this was several years later. It turned out that his inclusion in the
                    indictment was based on the fact that, as DCM in London at a certain point, the
                    maritime attach� on the embassy staff came to my father and said that one of the

                </p>
                <pb facs="0018" n="Page0018"/>
                <p>HOLMES: -I can't remember if it was Onassis - I think it was Niarchos - was
                    interested in talking to my father about the tankers, and my father told the
                    maritime attach�, he said, “Look, I'm in conflict of interest; I resigned my
                    position in that company. I'm a simple stockholder, and I really don't think it
                    would be appropriate for me to even see Mr. Niarchos or his representative, and
                    so he declined to see him.” It was the basis of his declining which caused the
                    Justice Department to think that there was some suspicious activity that was
                    being concealed, and on that basis he was indicted. Well, it took his lawyer in
                    New York, Chuck Spofford, who was with a major law firm there, about three weeks
                    to put a case together, a counter-argument, that had the Justice Department
                    backpedaling furiously to drop the thing. In fact, they did drop it, but my
                    father wanted the thing to go to trial because he wanted to clear his name,
                    because he felt that there would be some lingering question about it, and he
                    tried through his lawyers to actually have a hearing at least so this thing
                    could be put to bed, and the Justice Department refused to do it because they
                    were embarrassed by the flimsy way that they had put the case together against
                    my father. So they dropped it and refused to go further with it, and that led to
                    some problems for my father, because he was subsequently nominated for a number
                    of jobs which a senator from Delaware who always thought that where there's
                    smoke there's fire, there must be something in Holmes's past, et cetera et
                    cetera, always promised to make trouble even though he was sort of a singular
                    agent on this war path. Every time the White House would check with the Senate
                    Foreign Relations Committee to see if there would be any problems, this guy
                    would say he was going to speak and oppose the nomination, and so the White
                    House was a little pusillanimous about it, quite frankly, and then would
                    backtrack. And so in 1955 my father had been nominated as ambassador to Iran,
                    and was about to go forward with his hearings and so forth, and the White House,
                    because of this one senator from Delaware - whose name now escapes me, I
                    probably suppressed it years ago - recalled the nomination, and I think it was
                    Selden Chapin that went instead. So subsequently a number of jobs came along. At
                    about that time, the Department decided to create the position of undersecretary
                    for political affairs, and Dulles nominated my father. My father was supposed to
                    be the first one to have that job, but again they ran into the same problem on
                    the Hill, and so his nomination was withdrawn. So for two or three years in the
                    mid-'50s, he was basically struggling to overcome this very unjust indictment
                    that had been returned against him. Eventually, he did a lot of NATO work, was a
                    direct advisor to Dulles on a number of issues. I would say that he had a very
                    interesting assignment. In 1957, on behalf of Dulles, he did a three-month
                    survey of Africa. He traveled to every place in Africa and came back after three
                    months having met all the high commissioners and all the colonial powers and the
                    fledgling governments, and wrote a major report to Dulles calling for a huge
                    change in our policy towards Africa, that from that point on we should stop
                    conducting our relations with the emerging African states through the colonial
                    offices of the old powers but we should go and directly establish relations with
                    those countries. As a result of that there was a major change in our policy
                    towards Africa. We set up embassies and consulates and so forth. He was
                    nominated then to be the first assistant secretary for Africa, and the same
                    thing happened. The same senator from Delaware raised his ugly head, and my
                    father's name was withdrawn once again by the White House, displaying its usual
                    courage in the face of what was a very limited opposition. And he went through
                    that period... It took a change of administration, when John Kennedy was elected
                    President. He knew about my father and knew him, and he and Chester Bowles got
                    together and said, “Look, this is ridiculous. We're going to nominate Julius
                    Holmes for an important job, and we're going to fight this thing through and get
                    it done. This injustice has lasted too long.” I remember Bowles asked my father,
                    he said, “Look, there are two major assignments coming up, and I'll give you
                    your choice. Italy - since you had that experience in World War II - or Iran.”
                    My father took Iran, thought that would be a more interesting job. And so they
                    did, and the senator did. They put his name forward in 1961, and I think there
                    were two or three votes against, a very small number, and my dad got a telegram
                    from Chip Bohlen, who was an old friend that he had come in with, from back in
                    the '20s and the '30s they'd been friends, because he'd been in some controversy
                    about one of his jobs, and he said, “Well, I had more names against me,” and
                    that sort of thing. Anyway, then he went to Iran in 1961 and stayed there for
                    four years. But it took him a long time to recover from that accusation. In the
                    mean time he'd done some interesting things. He was the last minister consul
                    general to Tangier, and helped midwife Moroccan independence, quite by accident,
                    when the Istiqlal was fighting furiously to liberate themselves from the French
                    Protectorate.Q: That's sort of the liberation group of Morocco.</p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>HOLMES: If memory serves, this must have been about 1957, in that time frame,
                    about 1957-58. We still had these sort of special consular responsibilities in
                    the old Tangier enclave - we, the British, the Italians, and the French, I think
                    [the Spanish?], all had “consular courts.” It was kind of an international zone,
                    and using that as his sort of perch, my father played a major role in helping
                    the Moroccans get their independence, and part of it was quite by chance,
                    because one day he and a guy named Bill Porter, who was later an ambassador -
                    when my father was in Tangier, Bill Porter was our consul in Rabat at the time -
                    were in a car at the time, driving from Rabat to Tangier, and coming from the
                    opposite direction there was a small French vehicle, a Quatre Chevaux [French:
                    four horsepower] Renault, that came around this curve too rapidly and turned and
                    rolled over into a field. So my dad and Bill Porter stopped their car, and they
                    went running over to help these guys, and they pulled them out of the vehicle,
                    and together the four of them righted the small Renault. This led to a
                    conversation, and one of the men was the leader of the Istiqlal, who was on the
                    run all the time from the French. I think his name was Ben Barka, but I'm not
                    certain. I can't recall. But anyway, they talk, and Ben Barka liked my dad, I
                    guess, and he said, “Look, I'd like to talk with you.” My dad said, “I'd like to
                    talk with you, too.” He said, “Well, I'll make contact with you, and it will be
                    by surreptitious means.” So that led to a number of meetings that my Dad had
                    with the leadership of the Istiqlal in Fez, in the medina, and then subsequently
                    he began to act as an informal go-between between the Istiqlal and the French.
                    Of course, he knew a lot of people in the French Government from the De Gaulle
                    years, so he would fly to Paris and talk to the French. He was an intermediary,
                    but he continued to have these private meetings with the Istiqlal. And one time,
                    when another very close Foreign Service friend, Ted Achilles - who was the DCM
                    in Paris at the time... One afternoon, Ted got a phone call from the Quai
                    d'Orsay, and the head of the American Desk there said, “We would like to know
                    what Julius Holmes was doing talking to So-and-so in such-and-such a hotel in
                    Madrid this morning.” It seems the French intelligence service was doing a
                    pretty good job.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Deuxi�me Blind�.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: The Deuxi�me Blind�. But anyway, he did that and was actually very
                    effective in helping arrange the terms of Morocco's separation from France and
                    the end of the Protectorate, and at the end of that, my father was given a sort
                    of a wonderful photograph by Mohammed V, who was the king of Morocco at the
                    time, thanking him for his help and so forth. It was an interesting period in
                    our relationship with North Africa, and again, then, my father was nominated to
                    be the first ambassador to Morocco, and once again the name was withdrawn
                    because of the opposition of the senator from Delaware. I think his name was
                    Williams. It's coming back to me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John Williams. Well, let's go back to Princeton. What were
                        you majoring in?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>HOLMES: I majored in English with a sort of a bridge with French literature. It
                    was mostly English, but English-French. I minored in music. I took my naval
                    science courses as an obligation for my scholarship because I was going to be...
                    and I had no... I never even thought about the Foreign Service. Had I thought
                    about it, I would have prepared myself better. I would have taken more political
                    science and economics, which I did not. So I was really preparing myself for a
                    teaching career, and at the end of my time at Princeton, I was nominated for a
                    Woodrow Wilson Fellowship by Bob Goheen, who at the time was an associate
                    professor of classics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Later an ambassador to India.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Later president of Princeton and an ambassador to India, maintaining that
                    tradition of Presbyterians, because his father had been a Presbyterian
                    missionary in India. But anyway, I got this fellowship, and they said that they
                    would hold it in abeyance until I'd done my three years on active duty in the
                    Marine Corps. I was really counting on a career in English, and in my second
                    year in the Marine Corps out in California, I went to Cal Tech and was
                    interviewed by people, and I actually was offered the fellowship for a
                    full-course study for a Ph. D. at Berkeley in English.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, back to Princeton - this has been '50-54. How did
                        you find the social life there? This is the Eating Club period. I guess it
                        still is, but how did you find this as a way of life?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, it's interesting you raised the Eating Club rushing. A number of us
                    in our class, the class of '54, took exception to the Eating Club system because
                    we felt that it was unfairly administered and it always excluded a certain
                    percentage of every class, and so we basically - we were kind of rebels - and we
                    got a group together and told the clubs that unless they changed their system
                    and would guarantee that every member of our class would receive an invitation
                    to join at least one of the clubs, we would break up the system. We knew what we
                    were doing because they couldn't afford to have an entire class drop out, since,
                    in effect, instead of going to a mess hall, you ate at the Eating Club - they
                    were eating clubs, in other words. We won, and we had our day, and we forced the
                    club system to take the entire class, which they did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and they've maintained that ever since. Princeton had
                        the reputation of being a place where southern gentlemen went. It was the
                        one time when southerners from the deep South came up to get a look at the
                        North, if you want to call it that. Did you catch any of that feeling.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>HOLMES: No. That was certainly a little bit of a myth that had perhaps been true
                    at one time, if you read Scott Fitzgerald. Yes, certainly there were people who
                    came from the South. There were a lot of people who came from Maryland and from
                    Virginia who went to Princeton, but Princeton had an extremely rigorous academic
                    system. The passing grades for courses increased every year. In other words,
                    what was a passing grade in freshman year was no longer a pass in sophomore
                    year, and so forth and so forth. Being an honors candidate was not an election.
                    Every undergraduate was, by definition, an honors candidate. You had to do
                    independent work in your junior year. You had to write a senior thesis. So it
                    instilled a rigor in the system which actually resulted in a certain number of
                    casualties. People dropped out or flunked out along the way. So I would say that
                    the old “southern gentleman” thing had long since faded into history. It was a
                    tough place to compete in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You graduated in '54, and I guess as a naval candidate you
                        had your choice of... What did you do then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I actually had elected a couple of years earlier to take my commission in
                    the Marine Corps. The head of the naval science unit there was a Marine major,
                    and I was attracted to the Marine Corps. I also had some difficulty with a few
                    of the naval science courses, and so I elected already in my sophomore year to
                    go into the Marine Corps. My first summer's cruise I was a midshipman on the USS
                    Newport News, and one of my classmates and shipmates and fellow NROTC guy was
                    Don Rumsfeld, who was a close friend and later ended up as Secretary of Defense.
                    But by the end of my sophomore year I decided to go into the Marine Corps, and
                    so for my summer training between my junior and senior year I went to Quantico
                    and did training there and took my commission in the Marine Corps.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were in the Marine Corps until '57 then, '54 to
                        '57. Where did you serve?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I served in California. I was actually assigned to go to Korea, but by
                    the time I got to the staging area, after the basic school, which was early in
                    1955, or the fall of '54 maybe, they had decided to bring the First Division
                    home. So actually, I married up with the Seventh Marines in California and
                    served out my term there. I had a wonderful experience. I was a platoon
                    commander and a company commander, and I had a special amphibious reconnaissance
                    platoon at one point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the Marine Corps in those
                        days?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I loved the Marine Corps. I had a great experience as a junior
                    officer. When they first came back from Korea, came off the line, so to speak,
                    the troops were a little salty. I mean they weren't as disciplined as Marines
                    usually are known to be, and actually the regimental commander understood that,
                    and so we trained vigorously, more so than would normally be the case. I spent a
                    lot of time in the field doing exercises for about a year, just to sort of put
                    them back into shape, and it was an extremely interesting experience. They were,
                    of course, all volunteers, and some of the troops we had were from the inner
                    cities of America and some of them had some bad habits. There was always a
                    percentage of troublemakers in every battalion, and at a certain point, after I
                    had left my company, in my second battalion (I was the assistant intelligence
                    officer of the regiment), the regimental commander called me in and said that he
                    wanted to form an amphibious reconnaissance platoon. He wanted to have his own
                    platoon. And this wasn't recognized. This was to be an informal thing, so he
                    said that he would give me the best gunnery sergeant in the regiment and then we
                    would ask for volunteers from the battalions. So of course we got all the
                    troublemakers. What the Navy calls the “brig rats” were all dumped on us, and so
                    Gunnery Sergeant Hatfield, who was a veteran of Guadalcanal, and I shaped this
                    group into a platoon. They were always in trouble. I mean every Monday morning,
                    a third of them were missing. We had to go to Tijuana and get them out of the
                    jails. So we ended up spending endless weeks in the field with this group. We
                    had a wonderful time; it was a great experience.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I got married in 1959.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was after the Marine Corps.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, I came out of the Marine Corps in May of 1957, came home to
                    Washington. By that time I had decided that I wanted to go in the Foreign
                    Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Because, primarily, sort of faute de mieux. I had stayed in close touch
                    with two of my roommates from Princeton, both of whom were teaching, one at
                    Harvard and one at Berkeley. I didn't like what I heard about what they were
                    doing. There seemed like an awful lot of faculty politics, a lot of non-academic
                    assignments that were kind of administrative. There was the publish-or-perish
                    syndrome, and frankly, not a hell of a lot of teaching, and that's the part I
                    was interested in. So after considering it very carefully, I decided I didn't
                    really want to do that, and I notified the Woodrow Wilson Foundation that I
                    would not take their fellowship, notified Berkeley, and then took the Foreign
                    Service Exams - flunked them twice before passing. I was always very close. One
                    time I missed by a point, another time by four points. I realized that I didn't
                    have the political science and economics and that kind of background that I
                    needed, so I decided that I would do some graduate work to prepare myself better
                    before I took the exams again. So I came back to Washington in the summer of
                    1957, enrolled in economics and political science courses in summer school at
                    GW, and then applied to go to the Institute of Political Studies in Paris in the
                    following year on the GI Bill. They said I could come with my college degree
                    from Princeton and so forth if I could pass the French exam. So I went over
                    early. I went in September and studied French intensively. I already knew French
                    academically, but I couldn't speak it, so I went and tutored. I went and lived
                    in a pension in Tours, a place my sister had known about when she did her junior
                    year abroad, studied French at the Institute of French Studies in Poitiers. I
                    hired a tutor, an 85-year-old woman who was as tough as nails and drove me. I
                    went up to Paris at the end of October, passed, and got into what was than
                    called the Sciences-Po, now called the Institute of Political Studies at the
                    University of Paris and spent a year there. In December of that year, '57-58, I
                    went up to the embassy and took the Foreign Service Exams and passed them this
                    time. But it was a wonderful year to be in Paris for a future political officer
                    because that was the year that the French colonels pulled off their putsch in
                    Algiers in 1958, which brought De Gaulle back to power, disbanded the Fourth
                    Republic; and the Fifth Republic of France was formed with a new constitution, a
                    new system. It was a fabulous time to be in France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this the time when they were expecting para-drops in
                        Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, absolutely. As a matter of fact, it's interesting you say that
                    because I played rugby on the Sciences-Po, my university, team, and the guys on
                    that were sort of an interesting mixture of young French university students.
                    They were either very left, including some of the Communists, or very
                    conservative. I knew them all, and we were all buddies and played together all
                    year. After the first of the year, several members had finished their studies
                    and had to do their military service, and they went into the French Army and
                    went into the paratroops. That summer I saw a couple of them, and they explained
                    to me that during this very tense period when they were trying to persuade De
                    Gaulle to come back and take power, he said, “We went to bed at night with our
                    boots on, not knowing if we were going to fight for France or for the colonels.”
                    For several days, he said, for about 48 hours, it was very uncertain. So it was
                    a fascinating period.</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, I would think so. What about the debates within the
                        school? Were the students sort of... I keep thinking of their
                        manifestations, walking in the streets and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, we did. There were all kinds. I mean basically the student
                    population reflected the political make-up of France, but of course students are
                    always a little bit more radical than their parents, and we did a lot of manifs
                    [French: manifestations], they call them, the street demonstrations, I included.
                    The French police would come and arrest us and push us in the paddy wagons.
                    Their way of breaking up these demonstrations was to drive us out beyond the
                    gates of Paris, and knowing that students are always broke, they would then just
                    release us, and most people had to walk back because they didn't have any money,
                    even to buy a M�tro ticket to come back. So I was very much in the middle of
                    that, and while I was there doing that and enjoying life hugely, there was a
                    recruiting effort against me by a CIA agent from the embassy. I gave him about
                    five minutes. Not interested.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That brings up a subject, though. At Princeton and all,
                        did the CIA play much of a role? I was '46 to '50 at Williams, and the CIA
                        was just coming up, and boy, they were all over the place. Four or five
                        people out of a small class in my fraternity went into the CIA, and made
                        noises about it, too. I was wondering whether this had tempted you, or
                        no.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Interesting that you raise that. Yes, there were recruiting efforts by
                    the CIA on the Princeton campus, not surprisingly - after all, Allan Dulles was
                    a Princeton graduate himself, and that class of people-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's where they were coming from.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: That's where they were coming from. But I never had any contact with them
                    because I wasn't studying in a department that interested them. I was a
                    dilettante. I was majoring in English and minoring in music and going to Bach
                    concerts. I never had an approach from the CIA. I wasn't even aware of it, other
                    than some friends of mine, who were doing political science or history, would
                    tell me. But I wasn't aware of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in '57 or '58 you came out of Paris. By the way,
                        were you picking up American history and things of this sort, because this
                        is often... You know, one talks about political science, but there's often a
                        dearth of knowledge about the United States in many of the candidates.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>HOLMES: You're quite right, and I've always known a certain amount of American
                    history, but I did do some reading. I actually read the Morrison and Commager in
                    my sixth form year at St. Paul's, and we had a fabulous teacher who had been a
                    full professor of American history at Harvard, but for reasons of health had
                    left the faculty and was teaching American history at St. Paul's. He was my
                    teacher, and he made us read the New York Times every day, and it was a pretty
                    rich diet of American history, particularly modern, 20th-century, history and a
                    lot of contemporary affairs. So I continued reading articles, and that interests
                    me. I didn't have as much American history as I would have liked, but at the
                    Institute of Political Studies I was not studying American history there; I read
                    a lot of theory, reading John Stuart Mill and Hobbes and that sort of thing, the
                    history of political ideas. I basically picked the courses for the famous
                    professors. There was a famous professor Maurice Duverger, who wrote about the
                    history of political ideas, political philosophy. I took his course, and he had
                    also written a wonderful book on all the French political parties, so I studied
                    them assiduously and read about the Middle East a lot, and I particularly
                    studied the French experience in Indochina and Algeria. That formed the basis of
                    my very early opposition to our Vietnam policy, because my independent course of
                    study at the Sciences-Po had been about the French experience in Indochina, and
                    I went into it quite deeply. There were a lot of practitioners who'd come and
                    talk at the Sciences-Po, people who were not academicians but who had served in
                    Indochina. I read all the books, all the Lart�guy books and novels of the
                    “centurions,” and you know, when we began to drift into Vietnam, I can remember
                    thinking it was a horrible mistake to send Maxwell Taylor as our ambassador to
                    Saigon, because I could just see it beginning. I remember saying to somebody,
                    you know, their building the totem pole up so that when it crashes it will
                    really come down hard. Even then I was concerned that we were getting... It was
                    too much of a commitment of United States prestige for a cause which was lost
                    from the beginning. Based on my study at Sciences-Po, I was absolutely convinced
                    of that. Fortunately, my number never came up during my Foreign Service career.
                    I never was tapped to serve in CORDS or anything else, which surprised me, given
                    the fact that I had 4+/4+ French and I had this Marine Corps experience. I was
                    amazed, and quite honestly - I have to tell you this - I was so opposed to our
                    policy in Vietnam, I wasn't certain how I would react had I been assigned to
                    Vietnam. I would have done one of two things. I would either have resigned or I
                    would have gone, but I would not have tried through contacts to have my
                    assignment changed, because I had too much respect for those people, my
                    colleagues, who were assigned to Vietnam who didn't want to go there, some of
                    them, any more than I did. So I would have either resigned as a matter of
                    principle, or I would have gone. To this day I don't know what my decision would
                    have been.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes. Sciences-Po is the old fashion. It used to be called the
                    Sciences-Politiques, but now it's the Institute of Political Studies.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, while you were there, were you getting any feel for,
                        for want of a better term I'll call it, European Marxism and the Communist
                        Party? In the United States, traditionally, people have looked at Marxism,
                        but it doesn't take very well in the student body for the most part, but the
                        Europeans always seem to take political theory more seriously than Americans
                        do.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I think that's true.Q: Here you are in a place which, among other things,
                    obviously had to be a hotbed of this, and does this-</p>
                <p>HOLMES: I wouldn't say it was a hotbed. There were students at the Sciences-Po
                    who had grown up in Communist youth organizations of the French Communist Party
                    - not a lot of them. But they were there, they were visible, they worked for the
                    party. Some of them were recruited as escorts and trainers and buddies, friends,
                    for Africans who were sent by the French Government from various territories. I
                    knew, later, some of them who came from Cameroon. They would come to Paris and
                    sort of be dumped on the scene, and each one of them, they would try to assign a
                    student to become a friend and sort of begin to influence their thinking. Well,
                    there was a pretty well-organized process that they had. I was only vaguely
                    aware of it when I was at the Sciences-Po. I became more aware of it later when
                    I served at my first post in the Foreign Service in Cameroon and met some of
                    these young Cameroonians who had been courted by French Communist students,
                    including at my old institution. So I realized later that it was a pretty
                    extensive system that the Party had set up. But it was less ideological in that
                    respect and more practical. I mean, they were basically recruiting cadres of
                    people that would later become influential players in those governments when
                    they became independent, so it was at the direction of the Communist Party, but
                    it was hopefully that they would transform those countries into
                    Communist-dominated countries.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, just to get a feel for understanding it, did you run
                        across - I'm not sure if the term is right - but the Cartesian way of
                        thinking... synthesis-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Th�se, antith�se, synth�se - yes, thesis, antithesis, synthesis.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Still, the French think of things as being logic, and for
                        Americans, things sort of happen. Did you run across this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0027" n="Page0027"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, a certain amount. I would say more for those that were into that
                    kind of discussion - and we would have discussions like that - I would say that
                    it was more the dyed-in-the-wool French Communist who was also an instructor,
                    who was more into that sort of dialectic, than the students. The students had a
                    pretty healthy disrespect for a certain kind of Cartesian logic when it came to
                    Marxist dialectics. But it's true. There is a kind of a... just the way... not
                    so much thinking about Communism, but certainly in the way young French are
                    taught, there is a so-called Cartesian logic, and they're very good at
                    dissecting problems and exposing a complicated situation in a pretty
                    well-organized, logical, lay-down of the elements of the problem. The judgment
                    that results from the analysis of the problem may be totally faulty, but the
                    analysis is usually clearly laid out. That was, I think, one benefit of French
                    education. You have to remember one thing. When the young Frenchman finishes his
                    lyc�e [French: high school] and he's done his bachot [French: Baccalaureate] and
                    he comes to the university, he's basically stuffed with knowledge. He has
                    learned years and years by rote.</p>
                <p>The young Frenchman coming out of the lyc�e has a head crammed with facts and
                    information, but he's not given much encouragement, up until the bachot, the
                    baccalaureate examinations, to do much free thinking, so when he gets to
                    university, all of a sudden, all the restraints are off, and he's subjected to
                    this sort of world of ideas and discussion and passion about politics. What
                    helps the young French university student is the preparation that he's had. He's
                    already has a base, but he has less of an ability to think on his own and come
                    up with sort of sound judgments about issues than his American counterpart,
                    because by the time his American counterpart gets to that same level of
                    university, particularly if he's been to a good secondary school, he's already
                    done a certain amount of independent analysis, and he or she has been encouraged
                    to think more on their own, under the tutoring of a good teacher, rather than
                    being told dogmatically, this is the way it is - which is what happens in a
                    French lyc�e. So I would say, in terms of being suddenly subjected to the world
                    of ideas, that perhaps the young American at the university is better equipped
                    to handle that than the young Frenchman. But that's a gross exaggeration.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I realize that. The reason I think it's interesting is
                        that, as a fledgling diplomat or a diplomat-possibly-to-be, as you were, and
                        others, an idea of how the French approach problems - and it's not just the
                        French, of course, but their colonial peoples and former colonial peoples -
                        I mean, they come out with this particular way of looking at things, and
                        sometimes it's difficult for Americans in official positions to kind of
                        understand where they're coming from, and so it's very handy to have some of
                        this perspective.</hi>

                <pb facs="0028" n="Page0028"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, absolutely. One thing I learned when I was a student in Paris, and
                    I learned it over and over again, particularly when I was in Cameroon, in what
                    was basically a League of Nations-UN mandated trust territory, that first of
                    all, French cultural policy is a huge dimension in their foreign policy. I mean,
                    they really do feel that they have a civilizing mission. I mean, they really
                    believe it. They are distressed when the French language is displaced by
                    English. I think now, since the '70s, particularly in the '80s and '90s, there
                    is sort of a different attitude now towards “the American incursion” into the
                    world of ideas and culture, but certainly in the '50s and '60s your average
                    product of the French university system really believe that. It explained a lot
                    of the investment that they made, which, if you looked at it uncynically, in a
                    place like Cameroon and Togo, which were trust territories which the French had
                    no hope of holding on to for very long, the commitment that they made in terms
                    of the infrastructure, the education - sure, they were creating people who would
                    be markets for their exports, but they also put a lot into those countries. The
                    French, I believe, prepared their Africans, from what I saw, much better for
                    independence than their British counterparts, certainly better than their
                    Spanish or Portuguese counterparts. They did a lot in preparing those countries,
                    and they went through some rough times, particularly after De Gaulle came back
                    to power and the French community was furious that Sekou Tour� in Guinea did not
                    buy into the program. He pulled the French out with a vengeance. When they cut
                    the ties, they took everything.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Allen, I think we'll stop at this point, and I put at the
                        end where we are so we can pick it up. The next time we'll have you coming
                        back, leaving Paris, coming back in '58, taking the Foreign Service Exam,
                        having you pass it. But I'd like to cover the oral exam and then the entry
                        into the Foreign Service and all that. We haven't taken that up.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ...and we'll pick this up. But you were saying you had to
                        pick up some money because the GI Bill didn't get you very far, so what were
                        you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>HOLMES: The GI Bill didn't get me very far, so I had two jobs while I was at the
                    Sciences-Po. One, I gave English lessons to an attractive young woman who was a
                    prot�g� of the French singer Charles Aznavour. She composed her own folksongs
                    and had a contract for six weeks to sing at the Blue Angel in New York, and she
                    wanted to be able to learn enough English to explain the essence of her songs.
                    So I charged the going rate and made a little money on the side. I also got a
                    job later in the year as an extra in a movie called The Reluctant Debutante,
                    which was filmed mostly in Paris with Rex Harrison and Kay Kendall, Johnny
                    Saxon, and Sandra Dee, I think it was. I was an extra. They wanted some
                    Anglo-Saxon looking people who could be in debutante party scenes dancing in
                    their tuxedos. So I rented a tuxedo. In that film, I got an extra special job as
                    a bartender, and I even had a little, small speaking role and made, what to me
                    seemed like a small fortune and allowed me to take a skiing vacation that
                    spring.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, I'll put, once again, at the end of this,
                        we'll pick this up, you left France in 1958, came back, and I'd like to talk
                        about your impressions and questions that you can remember of the oral exam
                        and all and then about entry into the Foreign Service.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is April 21, 1999. Allen, we're in 1958 and you're, what, back in
                    Washington from France?</p>
                <p>HOLMES: I'm back in Washington from France. I've taken the Foreign Service Exams
                    for the third time, I might add, and passed. I took them at the embassy in Paris
                    in December, 1957. I'm back in Washington waiting for an appointment, and while
                    waiting, I get a job in INR, in the Bureau of Intelligence and Research in the
                    department, as a civil servant, working in a very sensitive area of
                    intelligence, and I don't believe I can talk about it, which is too bad because
                    it's extremely interesting. I worked there for almost a year on European-related
                    questions while awaiting an appointment, and I finally got one and I joined the
                    Foreign Service the following May.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: 1959. You should know, Stu. You were in the same class.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: A-100?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, we were in the Senior Seminar together.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, okay.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I came in in '55.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Okay, well, it must have been May. I believe it was May, '59.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your class like - you know, gender, race, outlook
                        - would you say? Could you characterize some of the people in it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I can certainly do a contrast between my class and a class that I
                    mentored here at the Foreign Service Institute in 1992 - a striking difference
                    in the composition of the Foreign Service class.</p>
                <p>Our class was primarily male with an upper age limit of 32. The ages went from 21
                    to 32. There were a few women. I can't remember exactly how many, but probably
                    four, and a few of us had Foreign Service backgrounds. One classmate, in fact,
                    was probably the only fourth generation Foreign Service officer that I've ever
                    heard of - Homer Byington. He had one tour in Genoa and then left the Foreign
                    Service and did something else. But certainly the attitude was one of commitment
                    to public service, to a desire to play a role in America's new international
                    responsibilities that basically we had inherited at the end of World War II with
                    the dissolution of the power centers of the French Empire, the British Empire,
                    and so forth. There was a high spirit of idealism and dedication and a sense
                    among most of us that we were in this for a career. This was not quite a cradle
                    to grave commitment, but pretty close.</p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>By contrast, the class that I mentored in 1992 was evenly divided. I think there
                    36 officers, evenly divided among men and women, a fairly high number of
                    minorities, men and women, Hispanic, Asian, African American, tremendous age
                    spread - from 21 to 58 - which astonished me, particularly the woman who was 58,
                    because she'd already had two careers, including an early stint in the Peace
                    Corps, but according to the prevailing Department regulation at the time, as
                    long as you were still young enough to complete two tours of duty abroad, you
                    could serve. So this is a very different approach. Also the background of the
                    students was different. Quite a few lawyers, who had gone into law but were
                    frankly bored by corporate law and really just... I mean, the prospect of making
                    high fees down the line once they had made partner was interesting but was
                    basically overcome by the desire to do something different, something
                    interesting. A number of teachers. Two military officers, each of whom had done
                    20 years in the military. They were now embarking on a second career but who'd
                    had quite a bit of service abroad and were impressed by what could be done in
                    diplomacy. But the bottom line was that most of the people there were in it for
                    an experiment. They were going to try it. They were going to go out and have a
                    couple of tours and see whether they wanted to make this a career or not. So it
                    was a very different attitude, which I would say was more representative of
                    young people in today's world - that they're quite willing to move around and
                    change jobs and try different things before they actually settle down for their
                    life's work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that there would be an automatic division
                        between those who really were doing this as a second career - up in their
                        late 30s, early 40s and older - and those who were younger, because in a
                        career path, time is a factor as far as moving up the ladder, and there
                        isn't any sort of quick road to success. So that some would almost by age be
                        people who look upon this as a career and other who would look upon this as
                        a different lifetime experience. It's not that they wouldn't be
                        contributing, but it would divide the officer corps, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, clearly those people who were already in their mid-40s to late 50s,
                    obviously it wasn't going to be a lifetime career because they'd already had at
                    least one career, but among the younger ones, those who were in their late 20s
                    and early 30s, the same sense of giving it a go, try a couple of tours of duty
                    and see whether or not they wanted to stay in - it was still a very clear
                    absence of long-range commitment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, going back to this time in '59, what was your
                        impression - I mean, you'd already been involved - of the Foreign Service
                        that you were getting from you training? Was it just sort of a rather
                        introductory basic stuff, or were you getting any feel for the Foreign
                        Service from this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>HOLMES: That's a good question. It's hard for me to separate out what I already
                    knew about the Foreign Service, since I'd grown up in it, and to put myself in
                    the position of those who'd had no previous contact with the Foreign Service. I
                    would say that we really didn't get much of a feel for it. The instruction was
                    pretty rudimentary. There was a lot, obviously, on consular work because most of
                    us were going to have to do that initially. Some of us already had passed a
                    language so that we were ready to be deployed to an area where that particular
                    language was spoken. I applied for French-speaking Southeast Asia as my first
                    choice and French-speaking Africa as my second choice, and that's what I got,
                    was Africa. But I would say that today's preparation for Foreign Service life,
                    what is done at the Foreign Service Institute in the A-100 course and in other
                    courses, is much more thorough than what I experienced.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the “old boy” thing? Did you find yourself
                        running into this, like it or not, the fact, “Oh, we knew your father,” and
                        that sort of thing? Did that kind of get in your way, or help, or what?
                        HOLMES: Happily, it did not. First of all, I did not seek it, and people
                        were sensitive to that. The only old boy network which ever worked in my
                        favor was my wife's. Through her parents' AID service in Cambodia, I was
                        introduced to someone, which ended up in a job as a staff assistant to
                        Ambassador Frederick Reinhardt in Rome a few years later.</hi>

                    we got married, she was working as a script writer for USIA, having already had
                    several years' experience in professional documentaries, in films, working for
                    Encyclopaedia Britannica Films and other organizations here in Washington, and
                    she was working full time for USIA. When we got married, in July, 1959, just
                    before going to Yaound�, she still had an unfulfilled contract with USIA. She
                    completed that contract during our first assignment in Yaound�, where she was
                    writing scripts for USIA to introduce Africans to other Africans. It was kind of
                    interesting because, or course, that was the period when most territories and
                    colonies in Africa were approaching independence. So it was a very interesting
                    project, and she finished that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, can you describe Yaound� and the Cameroons in
                        1959?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: In 1959, when we arrived, we were the second wave, so to speak. The post
                    had been opened two years before. It was a two-man post, a consul and a vice
                    consul, and so when I arrived I replaced the vice consul, who was Walt Cutler,
                    who later was ambassador in several places and today is the head of the Meridian
                    House.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I've interviewed Walt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: They'd been there two years, and then we took their place. We were a
                    two-man consulate that grew very quickly into a consulate general. This was
                    basically August, 1959, when I replaced him, and by January 1st, 1960, we were
                    an embryonic embassy, because that was the date of Cameroon's independence. It
                    had been a trust territory. French Cameroon had been administered by France as a
                    result of successive decision by the League of Nations and then the United
                    Nations. After World War I, Cameroon and Togo had both been German colonies, and
                    they were established as trust territories, and each territory was divided into
                    a French zone and a British zone. In Cameroon, the French zone was the dominant
                    part of the country.</p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>And so we arrived there. It was an extremely interesting place that was not
                    exactly a colony but had been treated in some respects like other French
                    colonies, but what surprised me was the commitment of resources on the part of
                    France to a country that they knew they could not hope to keep, because after
                    all it had been mandated to them as a trust territory. When I got there, there
                    were over a thousand Cameroonians in lyc�es and universities in France, for
                    example. There was an enormous aluminum smelter at a place called Ed�a that the
                    French had built. There was a hydroelectric plant there as well. They had damned
                    the Wouri River. This wasn't just to produce rural electrification for the
                    Cameroonians, but also this was helping French industry, and they also owned
                    bauxite mines. They were active in Guinea. That was a French colony, and the
                    alumina product was then shipped to Cameroon where it was transformed at this
                    plant into aluminum ingots, which were then exported. So there was a high
                    measure of French commercial self-interest, but at the same time, there was a
                    sense of preparing a country for a future where they would be on their own, and
                    I'm particularly thinking of their education and their government structure. So
                    that was the atmosphere. There were cadres of Cameroonians that worked in all
                    the ministries that were directors of services and chefs de cabinet and so forth
                    that were obviously preparing themselves to step forward. There had been already
                    two series of elections, beginning, I think, in 1956. The beginning of the
                    democratic process was well underway.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the senior officer when you first arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: A guy named Bolard More was the consul general.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his background? Was he an African hand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: He had served in Africa. He had served in the American consulate in Lagos
                    - I think it may have been his first post - in the late '30s, just before World
                    War II.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was quite a-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: He was a senior man, an eccentric - a decided eccentric.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was he eccentric?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, he kept a case of Hershey bars locked up in the consulate safe, and
                    if you wrote a particularly good dispatch, he would reward you with a Hershey
                    bar, accompanied by the explanation that when he'd been a good boy growing up,
                    that his mother would give him a Hershey bar. He also was extraordinarily
                    stubborn and had an almost warped sense of duty. I noticed that he wasn't well,
                    didn't seem to be well. I knew that he was going to make this treacherous drive
                    125 miles south to a place called Ebolowa, where there was a Presbyterian
                    mission station. By the way, the American Presbyterians were the first colonists
                    in Cameroon. They were in there right after the Civil War, long before the
                    Germans came. There were three excellent American doctors there. So he went down
                    basically to have a dental checkup. I tipped him off. I knew them because I had
                    already been down there, and I sort of said, “Try to persuade the consul general
                    to have a physical while he's there. He's very stubborn, but I'm concerned about
                    him.” So they did that, and they found an enormous tumor on the side of his rib
                    cage, which he could easily touch while showering, and they phoned me to say
                    that he had to be evacuated immediately to the United States. He was in quite a
                    bit of pain. So I just went out to the local aero-club and I hired a little
                    airplane, with no authority of course, and had it flown down to pick him up,
                    because the road - the potholed road - it took about nine hours to drive 125
                    miles, the road was so bad. I was concerned about his condition, so I sent this
                    plane down to bring him back. He was furious with me for having done something
                    irregular without any authority from Washington. He had with him, though, the
                    very stern recommendation of the American doctors in Ebolowa that he should be
                    evacuated, and he was determined that he would send this by sea pouch. I made a
                    nuisance of myself, and said that if he didn't do it, I would send it by
                    telegram, and I did, and he was evacuated. He left about four days later, and he
                    got back here, and he actually went to Walter Reed. It was never quite clear to
                    me why, but they did remove the cancer, and they basically saved his life, and
                    he lived for quite a few years thereafter.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was maybe a little later, but at one time, did you
                        feel the heavy hand of Dakar on you, because many of the French posts, early
                        consulates and all, were being run out of Dakar? Was that still going on
                        when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, that wasn't going on. Dakar was, however, the communications relay
                    point for our com system. Our communications went to Dakar and from there to
                    Paris and then to Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But where did you report, from the Cameroons, before you
                        became and embassy? Straight up to Paris?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, no. We reported to the fledgling African bureau. We reported to the
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you were basically a-</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0036" n="Page0036"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Because actually my father - I think I recounted that in an earlier
                    session - had spent three months traveling through Africa at John Foster
                    Dulles's behest, and his trip around Africa was over by the end of 1957. He'd
                    made recommendations for an independent American foreign policy apparatus in
                    Africa, instead of going through the old colonial offices of the European
                    powers, that we would deal directly with these new countries. By then there was
                    - and I believe it was Joseph Satterthwaite who was the first assistant
                    secretary for African affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That sounds about right. Even though there were just the
                        two of you, were you being treated really as an embassy even when you were a
                        consular post?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, we only really started functioning as an embassy after the
                    independence celebrations, which were on the first of January, and which were
                    quite an extraordinary event, because it was really the first country to become
                    independent in Africa other than Ghana, which became independent in 1956, and
                    Kwame Nkrumah and so forth. We had an extraordinary delegation that came out.
                    There were five ambassadors, and the senior ambassador was Henry Cabot Lodge,
                    wearing - I kid thee not - a white linen suit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was wearing it later on in Saigon.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: We also had another ambassador that I remember very well because he was a
                    fascinating figure, General Benjamin O. Davis, Jr., who was an African American
                    Air Force general, and his father had been the first African American ever to
                    get flag rank in the Army, shortly after the end of World War II.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And to graduate from the military academy, too.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Anyway, B. O. Davis was an amazing man, and we enjoyed having him there.
                    We were really stretched in this tiny little embassy we had. We didn't have an
                    ambassador at that point. We had a charg�, who replaced Bolard More, Leo Cyr,
                    and myself, an administrative officer, whose spouse was the secretary, and we
                    had a CIA representative, and he had a secretary. That was the entire embassy,
                    so everybody pitched in. My wife was the escort officer for General Davis. The
                    facilities were fairly minimal in a place like Yaound�, and so there was a lot
                    of scrambling about, but it was a quite fascinating event, crowned, I remember,
                    in the gardens of the governor general's palace, which looked like a huge
                    marshmallow sitting in the middle of Yaound�, a Miss Ind�pendance election, and
                    there was a jury made up of representatives of the various countries that were
                    there, and the chairman of the jury was Golda Meir, representing Israel.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All these sultry beauties came out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: That's right. There was one from every province of Cameroon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in the first place, were we sort of under
                        instructions to let the French have their way? In other words, were we
                        trying to keep a relatively low profile at that point, or not? How were we
                        treating this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, we were trying to do it in a cooperative way, very definitely,
                    moving, I would say, deliberately but gradually, not to displace the French
                    certainly... I found myself, frankly, in the embassy, I was a kind of committee
                    of one. I didn't see the French presence in the same malevolent way that some of
                    my colleagues did because I saw the enormous investment by France, and I though
                    that was a benefit for the Cameroonians. So we moved, basically, to establish an
                    American presence, including an American cultural presence, and eventually we
                    had a very fine USIS officer who came, who was an African American, and then he
                    started an English language program, which was needed. It was the beginning of
                    establishing our cultural presence. That was resented to some degree - I don't
                    want to exaggerate - by the French embassy. But another African American came
                    in, and he started a series of courses that were available to Cameroonians. I as
                    a young vice consul, third secretary, had a ball. I did everything in the place.
                    I was the political officer, the consular officer, the economic officer, the AID
                    officer. Until USIA arrived, I was USIA. The first AID mission came. The
                    Cameroonians were interested, as most new countries are, in having a monument to
                    their independence, and so their idea was to extend the railroad that went from
                    Douala, the seaport, to Yaound�, the capital, to a place called Ngaounder�, up
                    north. They wanted to take it all the way up to the top of the country. So an
                    AID official came, and he was an expert in railroads, and he and I went out on
                    one of these little inspection cars and went up and down the length of the
                    railroad. It took us several days to travel up and down, and we made an
                    interesting discovery, that at a certain point we stopped because he noticed
                    something about the rails. We got down on our hands and knees and examined these
                    rails, and they were all German. What the French had done to save money, since
                    there was a certain amount of erosion on one side, when the French took over,
                    they reversed them, and they were still serviceable.</p>
                <p>Have I already recounted the night we had a crisis?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In Yaound�?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0038" n="Page0038"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, we haven't. Whatever. I certainly don't have it on
                        tape.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, that's an interesting story, again, an experience for a young
                    Foreign Service officer. A couple of months after independence, Richard Moose,
                    who was later undersecretary for management and in the Carter Administration was
                    assistant secretary for African affairs, Dick Moose came out - he was a Foreign
                    Service officer, and he'd had a tour of duty in Mexico City - as the
                    administrative officer, and we became fast friends. In fact, he lived with us
                    for the first several months at post until his wife came. Dick was new to Africa
                    and the French language, but he was the senior guy, so at a certain point he was
                    charg� and I was the number two. One day I got a call from the diplomatic
                    advisor to the president saying that the president wanted to see me immediately.
                    So Dick and I went over there, and there were the prime minister and the foreign
                    minister, the three of them. They seemed quite agitated because they had reports
                    of a Czech freighter offloading weapons in burlap bags onto African pirogues,
                    which were then being paddled into the beaches, and people had reported that
                    they were weapons and they had been distributed to tribal elements down
                    somewhere near Douala. They were concerned that a dissident movement called the
                    Union of the Cameroonian Peoples (the UPC), which had opposed the French
                    presence and then independence under the terms that had occurred, led by a
                    fellow named F�lix Moumi�. They had carried out quite a few assassinations while
                    we were there. In fact, the week after we arrived, they killed a number of
                    French people right downtown with machetes. But the Cameroonian President
                    Ahmadou Ahidjo was at pains to point out that this group, with the help of the
                    Warsaw Pact, was obviously trying to unseat his new government. They wanted the
                    United States to help. So we got as much information as we could on this. The
                    CIA representative back at the embassy had no information about it. So Dick
                    Moose and I sat down and wrote the dispatch of our lives. This was going to make
                    our careers. You know, this is a crisis. So we wrote a dispatch. To give you an
                    idea of the kind of communications we had in those days, after writing the
                    dispatch, we then went and opened the vault, got out the “one-time pad” and
                    transliterated the message into code, carefully choosing the right letters,
                    typed it up ourselves, and then, since it was nine o'clock at night, I then went
                    down to the PTT, the post office, which set up by the French was now run by the
                    Cameroonians, and it was after hours, so there was only one person on duty. I
                    couldn't get him to answer the door, so I went around to the back and looked
                    through the window, and I could see that he was sort of snoozing, slumped at a
                    table, and there was a half-empty bottle of palm wine there. So I finally got
                    him to answer the door, I made him some coffee, sobered him up, and finally, I
                    think about two hours later, he sent the message. Well, of course, it was
                    relayed to Dakar, to Paris, to Washington. By the time it got to Washington, it
                    was totally garbled, and it was a “night action” cable, you know, secret night
                    action. So they then sent a service message saying “We couldn't read your
                    message. Please repeat.” But by the time we went through the whole process a
                    second time the whole crisis had passed. It turned out to be a very inaccurate
                    report that the new Cameroonian government received. So there was a lesson in
                    that for me.</p>

                        I've talked to who've dealt with the early ones usually have a... Europeans
                        who want to do business would call up a ministry and say, “Let me speak to
                        the white.” In other words, there was a certain bypassing of the
                        native-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: There was some of that for a while - I would say probably in the first
                    six to eight months. In every ministry there was a director of services, whereas
                    under the old French trust setup there had been French ministers with Africans.
                    The best educated ones were director of services and chefs de cabinet and so
                    forth. The situation reversed after independence. So, yes, there was very often
                    a French civil servant who was in the back room and who was helping make things
                    run, and obviously if it involved contracts and obviously funneling as many as
                    he could to French companies, which was not surprising. But that didn't last for
                    a very long time. I noticed there were some remarkable Cameroonians that came
                    out of university and that rose up and quickly established themselves. I
                    remember in particular the second foreign minister. The first one was a man
                    named Charles Okala, who spoke remarkable French and was extraordinarily well
                    educated. I remember he made a dramatic speech to the UN where he talked about
                    the Solomonic judgment of the League of Nations in having divided Cameroon into
                    two babies, one for the French and one for the British. He was extremely
                    cultivated and very smart, shrewd. But he was eventually replaced by another
                    extremely cultivated and shrewd Cameroonian named Jean Faustus B�tay�n�. There
                    were people that emerged that had been prepared, basically, by French schooling.
                    That's what kept coming home to me. Remarkable people who very quickly assumed
                    responsibility of their offices and were sailing on their own and frequently
                    turning aside the advice - often uninvited - of their French counselors.</p>

                        sides into this one country? How did it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: That happened really after I left. I was there for two years. But it
                    happened in stages. The British sliver of Cameroon, which nestled between the
                    large French Cameroon and Nigeria, was divided into two sections. The northern
                    section was largely inhabited by Hausas, which was a very large Nigerian tribe,
                    and so there as a great deal of agitation to join Nigeria. If memory serves
                    correctly - this was happening just as I was leaving - they had a referendum,
                    and I believe that they joined Nigeria. It was subsequent to that, perhaps a
                    year or two later, that the larger part of British Cameroon then joined French
                    Cameroon into one large state.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you finding that you were naturally attracted toward

                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>HOLMES: No. We had extraordinarily little contact with the British side. One
                    reason for that is that while we were there we only had this very small embassy
                    in Yaound�. We didn't have a consulate in Douala. That came later. Douala was
                    the seaport and the commercial center and was much bigger and more active.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was that on the British side, Douala?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, that was on the French side. That was actually the major seaport of
                    Cameroon, and it was on the French side. I would go down there periodically,
                    every two months or so, just to talk to people, find out what was going on, and
                    sometimes do some consular services. I took our new ambassador, Leland Barrows,
                    down there to meet the mayor and the municipal council, and that was a very
                    interesting encounter. It was rather stiff. We had lunch, and the mayor, Mayor
                    Tokoto, was trying to break the ice. He was working harder at that than
                    Ambassador Barrows was, so finally he said, “You know, Mr. Ambassador, I come
                    from a very...”</p>
                <p>So Mayor Tokoto, trying to impress the ambassador with his authority, said,
                    “We've been around for a long time. In fact, we sold a number of slaves from the
                    hinterland to the United States and made a lot of money.” There was a kind of a
                    silence around the table, and then Barrows, rising to the occasion, said, “Well,
                    I'm sure that Mr. Holmes's great-great grandfather bought a lot of them.”
                    Laughter broke out around the table, and all the Cameroonians just thought that
                    was a hoot. That really did it. After that we got along famously.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, he wasn't. He was from Kansas.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: Well, he basically was an AID officer, and in World War II, something I
                    found out - I had a hard time dealing with this - he was senior official in the
                    War Relocation Authority, basically that authority which interned Japanese
                    Americans. How anybody could possibly have agreed to serve in that capacity
                    still troubles me.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, yes. He spoke French quite well. He knew a lot about development
                    economics, which was extraordinarily helpful, but he did have an ingrained
                    prejudice against the French. He saw the French as the enemy, and that they were
                    only interested in exploiting the Cameroon, and that resulted in many long
                    discussions between the two of us.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think that this was something that took, really,
                        almost a generation of Foreign Service officers to work out in Africa, in a
                        way. I mean, this idea of we were the “independence country,” and our
                        anti-colonial attitude and coming into this, and the French, from our point
                        of view being beastly on things, which continues to today. I would think it
                        would be very easy to find this idea even though we weren't trying to have
                        the takeover from the French as the official policy as being the dominant
                        power at the same time be very hard to restrain our people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I would describe it in a different way. By the time we were in
                    Africa and for several years after, there was already a process underway of
                    various countries acceding to independence, but under French tutelage. In other
                    words, the French were not trying to prevent this. If you remember, by that
                    time, Charles De Gaulle had come back in 1958, the Fifth Republic had been
                    established, and one of the things that De Gaulle established was a new French
                    equivalence of the commonwealth, basically a French community. I can't remember
                    exactly what it was called, but it was a French community of nations in Africa,
                    and he invited representation in the French Senate from African countries, and
                    there were benefits, obviously, for African countries to become associate
                    members of this new French community. The one country that opposed this
                    invitation staunchly was Sekou Tour� in Guinea, and De Gaulle was furious that
                    they hadn't accepted his grand offer, and so when the French left they took
                    everything. I mean they took the phones out of the offices. It was
                    extraordinary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the faucets.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: It was a real severing of the umbilical cord. But the rest - French West
                    Africa and then the southern part, the sort of Brazzaville sector - these
                    countries were moving towards independence, and the French were not opposing it.
                    In fact, they were helping the process, but with a view to maintaining their
                    influence - in fact, wherever possible their control, not only of the foreign
                    policy of those countries but also of their economies. Of course the CFA franc
                    was still pegged to the French franc, so the French treasury had a lot of
                    influence on the situation. But they weren't opposing independence; they were
                    just carving out an area of influence, which of course has remained, in
                    increasingly diminishing ways, to this day.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that one of the most sensitive things
                        would be to set up English classes and things of this nature, because France
                        and the French language and all, and all of a sudden to throw English into
                        this pot would have been very annoying.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, they were annoyed. There's no doubt about it. But first of all, it
                    wasn't very widespread. I mean, our English language classes were pretty small.
                    It was a very small program, and I daresay the program was also small in other
                    parts of West Africa, and they really kind of blanketed their countries with
                    French. You see the French - as opposed to the British - they had a very
                    different approach to instruction. They basically sent successive generations of
                    Frenchmen and French women to teach in African schools, whereas the British,
                    after an initial generation, the Nigerians, for example, next door, then became
                    the teachers. So the British began to bow out of the actual primary and
                    secondary schooling that the French maintained. By doing that, they maintained a
                    certain measure of influence. In fact, I remember there was a song that was
                    played, and everybody used to laugh about it. It was a cha-cha-cha, and it was
                    called “Nos anc�tres, les gaulois [French: Our ancestors, the Gauls].” The humor
                    in it was that the French had been so successful with their civilizing mission,
                    that many young Africans thought that their ancestors were the Gauls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we concerned at that point about the “Communist
                        menace,” the Soviet menace? Did we seen Cameroons as any kind of a

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Not at the time that I was there, although there was the story I told you
                    about the Czech weapons. Whether this was true or whether this was a rather
                    shrewd attempt on the part of the new Cameroonian leadership to open up what
                    they would hope would be a floodgate of AID, recognizing that even if they
                    weren't, they might be a battlefield in the Cold War. But there were influences.
                    I mean, this fellow F�lix Moumi� of the UPC, who was living in Geneva, and we
                    knew that at one time the Soviets had him on the payroll. But he was eventually
                    assassinated by an organization called the Red Hand. No one ever quite knew who
                    they were or who sponsored them, but he was assassinated in Geneva.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: No, we were establishing our presence and our influence, and as I say,
                    there was some initial skirmishing with the old colonial offices, with the
                    British and the French, but by and large I think there was a sense that we were
                    embarked along similar strategic lines to further the development of these
                    countries for joining the family of nations and also, down the road, to ensure
                    that they did not become prey to Soviet-style coups and areas of influence -
                    which happened in Guinea, of course. Sekou Tour� was pretty smart about keeping
                    control of his own country's destiny, but willingly worked with the Soviets and
                    milked them for whatever he could get in the way of assistance.</p>

                        were probably one exception in the whole African place, but was there at
                        that time a firm conviction in the thought process that no matter what
                        happened we didn't want to see Africa start splitting up along tribal lines?
                        I mean in other words, keep the borders.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Now that's a hard one for me to give much of a perspective on for the
                    simple reason that Cameroon was the racial crossroads of Africa, because it was
                    every kind... I mean, we had the Nigero-Sudanese group, we had the Bantu group,
                    we had Pygmies, we had the sort of Hamitic and even Semitic influence in the
                    north of Cameroon, the Fulani tribesmen, who were Muslim. There was a reasonably
                    clear line of demarcation between the Islamic north and the animist/Christian
                    south, and it was basically where the jungle started, because that's where the
                    tsetse fly decimated the Fulani cavalry when they came 150 years before out of
                    the north and moved into that part of Africa. They only went as far as the
                    tsetse fly permitted them to. There was a place, I remember, in the area close
                    to British Cameroon and Nigeria, a river called the Noun River, and to the north
                    of the river was a tribe called Bamoun. This was all in French Cameroon. The
                    Bamoun tribe was Muslim, and on the other side of the River were the Bamil�k�.
                    The Bamil�k� were animist/Christian, and they were the sort of entrepreneurs of
                    Cameroon - very, very smart, very shrewd business people. They fought
                    periodically. They would raid each others' villages, and the central government
                    in Yaound� would have to go take care of it. But it's kind of an example of a
                    kind of natural line of division that vegetation and wildlife produced in the
                    settlement of that part of Africa, but it was really quite an extraordinary
                    grouping of different peoples in Cameroon. It really was the sort of racial
                    crossroads of Africa.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any thought at that point - this was sort of
                        the high point of enthusiasm and all that - of becoming an Africanist? Was
                        this where you were pointing yourself at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0044" n="Page0044"/>
                <p>HOLMES: No, not particularly. I was fascinated by it. I had an extraordinary two
                    years and enjoyed every minute of it, learned a lot. I might have gone in the
                    direction of becoming an Africanist except that my wife was very, very ill and
                    nearly died. I nearly lost her in Cameroon during the last two months that we
                    were there. She had an unexplained pain. The one doctor that was there, the one
                    surgeon, was up-country looking after some chieftain's wife, and so we were just
                    waiting for him to come back anxiously, and she had three days of terrible pain,
                    and when he came back he decided to have exploratory surgery and found that she
                    had an amoebic abscess on her colon, which quickly developed into peritonitis,
                    and this little bush hospital in Yaound� had six French sisters, a nursing
                    order, and one of the sisters was the anesthesiologist, and so she stayed with
                    Marilyn all night to nurse her, care for her during the critical postoperative
                    period. Then for about five or six days it was really pretty dicey. But she got
                    through it. By that time we had our first child, and so the DCM/charg�, Leo Cyr,
                    and his wonderful wife, took over the baby and took care of her. I just
                    stationed myself as a full-time monitor/nurse by Marilyn's bed, because the
                    French sisters couldn't stay there the whole time and I didn't have confidence
                    in some of the other orderlies. We got through that, and then we requested... We
                    were about three or four weeks short of our two-year mandatory assignment there,
                    and we requested permission from Washington to leave early because she was in
                    such terrible condition and the doctors strongly recommended that she be
                    evacuated, basically, that we leave early. Her parents were stationed by that
                    time in Morocco, in Tangier, and there was an American naval hospital in what
                    had been called Port Lyautey - it was then called Kenitra - so that seemed
                    advisable, to go there and recuperate. Well, in those days, the State
                    Department's medical division was pretty primitive in the way it operated, and
                    they refused permission. They said we could not be evacuated because I hadn't
                    completed the two years. There was provision in the law for emergency
                    evacuation, but not for emergency recuperation, and so they refused permission
                    to evacuate her. So I basically, with the ambassador's permission, borrowed
                    money from my father, bought my own tickets, and left early - took Marilyn to
                    Rabat. I said Tangier, but I meant Rabat, and that was a very good thing that we
                    did. We left about three and a half weeks before the end of our tour. She did
                    finally recover from that and we were reassigned to Washington, but her case and
                    an officer named McKinnon who died, I think it was in Ouagadougou during the
                    same period and was very ill... because the Department's procedures for taking
                    care of people were so inflexible, that the French ambassador personally
                    interceded in this - I think it was Ouagadougou - and was able to get McKinnon -
                    his name was Bob McKinnon; he was charg�, the number two - get him evacuated to
                    Paris on an Air France plane, but he either died on the way or shortly after
                    getting to Paris. So these two cases, Marilyn's and McKinnon's, were used by the
                    Department to go and get special authority and special funding from the Congress
                    to establish a crash medical program for all these new posts in Africa. That
                    eventually was done, and the regulations were revised. But Marilyn's was one of
                    the two test cases.</p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>I was pretty upset, as you can imagine, but it meant, of course, that the idea of
                    having a career in Africa was out, because she had subsequent problems as a
                    result of this. The early experience that she'd had with amoeba and various
                    other tropical diseases in Cambodia, where she had been evacuated a number of
                    times to Hong Kong for treatment, plus the African experience, together meant
                    that she was kind of damaged. So wisely we were not able to get clearance to go
                    to places that did not have good medical facilities and a reasonably salubrious
                    atmosphere.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: -and I was assigned to the Operations Center as a reports officer. We had
                    three eight-hour shifts, and we changed every two days, which was madness. We
                    should have been on it a week at a time so that you could get adjusted, but
                    despite the fact that I was an honors graduate in English from Princeton, I
                    learned more about the English language and good writing from a guy who was the
                    chief reports officer named Sam Gammon in the six months that spent in the
                    Operations Center having my nightly summary critiqued the following day by Sam,
                    things that we would write for the Secretary out of all the avalanche of cables
                    that came in overnight. That was a great experience, and I did that for about
                    six months.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: It was relatively new, and our job - particularly if you were on the

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: The graveyard shift would be basically from midnight to eight in the
                    morning. We would sift through - there were three or four of us on duty - and we
                    would divide up the world geographically, and then somebody would handle Europe,
                    somebody would handle Africa, somebody the Middle East and the Asia and Pacific
                    area, and so forth, and go through all the cable traffic and basically write up
                    the most compelling issue stories for the early morning summary for the
                    secretary. They would typically be maybe a dozen stories - depending on what was
                    going on in the world. There might be a few more or a few less than that, but it
                    was quite an experience.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>HOLMES: I did that into sometime in early 1962, when I was recruited by the
                    undersecretary for political affairs, George McGhee, to be the staff assistant
                    in his office. He had two assistants, a senior and a junior, and I was the
                    junior assistant, and I did that kind of work for him.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's go back to the Op Center for a minute. You had been
                        away and there had been sort of a real change with the Kennedy
                        Administration coming in. Did you get any feel for the style of Kennedy
                        Administration?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, absolutely. This is really quite wonderful. Of course, Kennedy was a
                    self-styled diplomatist and internationalist, historian, and he always wanted to
                    get the view of the Desk officer. This is something unusual in today's world. I
                    lived next door. I lived in a little row house on 23rd street, just around the
                    corner from the Department, which is now the Pan American Health Union. We were
                    dispossessed by the right of eminent domain. They tore it down, and we had to
                    move. I lived next door to a guy who was the Nepalese Desk officer, and there
                    was a visit coming to Washington by the king of Nepal, I think it was - the
                    Nepalese leader - and there was an issue that we had because there was a problem
                    with India. Kennedy, in reading the briefing materials, wasn't satisfied that he
                    had the full story, so he phoned the Desk officer. That night, when Bob came
                    home, he knocked on my door and he told me how he'd been summoned to the White
                    House and he sat down with the President and briefed him for about 25 minutes on
                    what was going on. That was not an isolated case. Kennedy did that a lot. He
                    cared about the Foreign Service, and he wanted to make an impact. As a matter of
                    fact, I got promoted that year from FSO-8, I think, to FSO-7, and that year the
                    entire class of promotees were invited to the Rose Garden, and the President
                    swore us in and spoke to us and then came and shook hands with every one of us.
                    That was an exhilarating experience, as you can imagine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know. I was in Washington during part of this time, and
                        sometimes I would call people up from another office and say, “My name's
                        Kennedy,” you know, and I would get a very long “Hello-o-o,” you know,
                        people very touchy. I mean, who the hell is this Kennedy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>Were there any particular things during the Op Center time that particularly
                    stirred the pot when you were there?</p>
                <p>HOLMES: Do you mean in terms of crises?</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Nothing that comes to mind, except, of course, things were going badly in
                    the Congo, and because I had served in Cameroon, I ended up doing a lot of the
                    summaries about what was going on in Africa, and I think that because of what I
                    was writing during the night about what was going on in the Congo is perhaps one
                    of the reasons why my name came to the attention of George McGhee, the
                    undersecretary for political affairs, probably became some people that I knew on
                    the Congo Desk, knowing that he was looking for a staff assistant, proposed me.
                    One of them was Frank Carlucci, and Frank and I had been in college together. He
                    was a couple of years ahead of me, but of course Frank was serving in the Congo
                    when Kennedy was President, and there was a riot, and actually he was stabbed in
                    the shoulder while trying to protect some people on a bus, and he came to the
                    attention of Kennedy. Anyway, I think that was the one sort of crisis that got
                    my attention, because that's what I was working on, and that led to my next job
                    in the Department.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, from early '62 until 1963, when I was assigned to Rome, which was a
                    welcome change, I must say. That was a wonderful assignment, and my first period
                    there I was assigned as the special assistant to the ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's talk about '62-63 with George McGhee. McGhee
                        is still with us. What was his style of operation, and how did he use you,
                        from your observation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I was really the junior staff assistant in the office, and I sat in on a
                    lot of meetings, took notes, wrote up reports on important meetings and tracked
                    certain issues for him. He was the sort of Seventh Floor principal responsible
                    for what was going on in Africa, and particularly the Congo, and for a long,
                    long period, during all the crises over Patrice Lumumba and Katanga and our own
                    people who got in trouble there and the Belgian paratroopers who went in-</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, all of that. This was a very active period, and McGhee was spending
                    the major amount of his time on that issue. He would have staff meetings every
                    few days of all the regional assistant secretaries, and one of the amusing
                    things I remember was... McGhee was very proactive and very positive and sort of
                    a take-charge guy, and I could tell, just sitting as a young officer, watching
                    assistant secretaries, there was a little resentment. They were assistant
                    secretaries and there were sometimes some exchanges that were a little testy,
                    because McGhee would always have a very strong view, and sometimes he was just
                    flat wrong. Then there were some interesting exchanges. But the most interesting
                    thing that would happen periodically was to watch Averell Harriman, who was then
                    assistant secretary for the Far East, and he was totally bored by McGhee.
                    Whether McGhee noticed this or not is not clear, but whenever McGhee began one
                    of his soliloquies, Harriman would take his hearing aid out and handkerchief and
                    laboriously clean his hearing aid, for the longest time, and as soon as McGhee
                    wound down, he would put the hearing aid back in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering about the relationship with Harriman
                        there, because Harriman had been governor of New York and advisor to
                        Roosevelt.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: The guy was enormously experienced.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought he would sort of tower.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: He did. Whenever an Asian-Pacific subject would come up, he would tower
                    over McGhee, and he was not shy about going directly to the Secretary when he
                    needed to, to talk about a particular issue, and he was always invited by the
                    Secretary.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: McGhee was undersecretary for political affairs - the
                        title keeps changing - but this was supposed to be the top professional job.
                        How did he relate to Rusk? Did you get any feel for this, or were you too
                        far removed?HOLMES: Too far removed. I can't really say. But he had a
                        special connection later on, after Kennedy's assassination, with Lyndon
                        Johnson because he's a fellow Texan, and one of my jobs was to monitor his
                        phone calls. He had a toggle switch on his desk, and when he wanted me to
                        listen in so that it would spare him having to debrief me, I would monitor
                        the phone call and then make notes on this conversation - again, to keep a
                        record of what was going on and for follow-up, particularly for actionable
                        items; that was one of my duties. So I remember there was a fairly
                        substantial leak in the New York Times of a very delicate policy issue, and
                        I don't remember what the issue was. What I do remember was monitoring this
                        phone call and Johnson just really chewing out George McGhee. I remember the
                        way he started. He said, “George, Ah'm [I'm] so damn mad Ah [I] could say
                        skat” - something like that. It was very much of a Texas expression. McGhee
                        was very much on the defensive on this and was apologizing and saying,
                        “Well, I have no idea where this leak occurred, but I'll look into it and
                        I'll find out.” So I dutifully recorded all of this, but I didn't have to
                        wait very long. He came into my office and told me to get right on it and
                        track it down, where this leak had occurred. Well, by the time we'd
                        investigated it - it took us about four or five days - you know where the
                        leak came from? Right out of Johnson's office.</hi>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: You know, he was covering his tracks by blaming it on McGhee, his fellow

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left that job in '63. Did you get involved
                        during the Kennedy assassination?</hi>

                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>HOLMES: The Kennedy assassination, I was already in Italy by that time. Wait a
                    minute. That doesn't quite jibe. I guess when Johnson called McGhee, he must
                    have called him as Vice President, because I remember very clearly Kennedy's
                    assassination, because I was the staff assistant to Ambassador Frederick
                    Reinhardt. He was on a trip in the north. I was out at Ciampino Airport, which
                    is the military airport in Rome, standing in the dark on a little strip there,
                    which was where the air attach� was allowed to land and take off. There was a
                    small aircraft in those days that the air attach� had, and Reinhardt was on a
                    trip in the north. It must have been around eight or nine o'clock in the
                    evening. I was waiting in the dark for this. I knew this plane was going to come
                    in. I had the car to meet him and tell him what was going on. Suddenly I heard
                    somebody yelling, in Italian, and it was a young Italian officer, and he came up
                    and asked me if I was from the American embassy. I said, yes, I was. He said,
                    “Are you named Holmes? Well, there's a message in that President Kennedy has
                    been shot, and we wanted you to know that because we know that you're waiting
                    for your ambassador to arrive.” So while waiting for Reinhardt, I quickly went
                    to a phone and got as much information as I could, and there wasn't much
                    information, other than that he'd been shot. Then by the time Reinhardt got
                    there and we went immediately to the embassy, it wasn't too long after that that
                    word came in that he had died from gunshot wounds. So then that precipitated an
                    extraordinary night and several days of the emotional outpourings of the Italian
                    people, with people coming around to the embassy, and that night, to offer their
                    condolences. I remember the taxicab drivers of Rome organized a cort�ge the next
                    day, and there must have been a hundred taxicabs or more that came to the
                    embassy and deposited wreaths and flowers. It was incredible.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I went through that in, of all places, Belgrade, a place
                        we are as of today bombing. When you went to Rome, was your initial job or

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, my job was to be the staff assistant, and I did that for about 9
                    months, I guess, before rotating into the Political Section as the assistant
                    pol-mil officer.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I wasn't too concerned because I knew that the job was a rotating
                    job, and that the ambassador did not like to keep people in that job for along
                    time, that I would be rotated in to the Political Section, which is what I
                    wanted to do. So I knew it was just a matter of time and also that I would learn
                    something from an extremely experienced career Foreign Service officer and that
                    this would be a good entr�e for me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk a bit about Frederick Reinhardt?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, Frederick Reinhardt was a great professional with a lot of
                    experience. By the time he came to Rome as ambassador, he had been ambassador in
                    Cairo and before that I believe he was our first ambassador to Saigon, after
                    Dien Bien Phu, basically. He was an extraordinarily experienced, very analytical
                    guy with tremendous judgment and a sort of a historical vision of where the
                    United States was going, where it had been. In World War II, he was a Russian
                    language officer in our embassy in Moscow, and when the German Army was
                    advancing, most of the embassies were evacuated, and the only two that stayed
                    were Freddie Reinhardt and Tommy Thompson. One looked after American interests
                    and the other after British interests. I think Freddie was looking after British
                    interests, which I always thought was kind of curious. But he was a terrific
                    linguist. I mean he spoke fluent Russian, French, Italian, German, and Swiss
                    German, and he spoke them all really well - enough to be able to negotiate and
                    do his business in all those languages. He liked learning languages well,
                    thoroughly. He was extremely professional.</p>
                <p>He was much more interested than some of his predecessors had been in reaching
                    out to new Italian political formations that had been unpopular in the past. For
                    example, before the Kennedy Administration, there had been a kind of a hands-off
                    attitude towards contact with the Socialist Party of Italy, which is kind of
                    amazing when you think about it, but Freddie Reinhardt recognized that there was
                    an Albanian American named Steve Peters, a remarkable officer, who looked like
                    Ben Gurion. He was short and had flowing white hair, like a lion's mane. He was
                    an amazing figure. He spoke beautiful Italian, and he had contacts (which were
                    not entirely approved) with members of the Socialist Party. Reinhardt encouraged
                    him to bring his friendship with Pietro Nenni, who was the head of the Socialist
                    Party, out into the open because he wanted Washington to recognize that this was
                    important to do. He succeeded. Actually, in the Democratic Administration,
                    Kennedy, it wasn't that difficult to get them to do that. Of course, the
                    Communist Party was out of bounds. We still handled relations with the Vatican
                    through one officer in the Political Section in those days, and Reinhardt wanted
                    to change that as well. But he was an extremely professional guy, and he was
                    frequently asked to comment or make recommendations on policy areas outside of
                    Italy because of his tremendous experience.</p>
                <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                <p>I remember one incident in particular that says something. He was staunchly, as
                    you might imagine... we were all sort of Cold War warriors, and particularly
                    given his experience in World War II, and he wasn't really allowed to go after
                    the PCI, the Communist Party of Italy. But there was an interesting event that
                    occurred. One of Reinhardt's duties as the American ambassador was to be part of
                    the committee that looked after the Testaccio Cemetery in Rome, which was a
                    cemetery for non-Catholics, basically - Russian Orthodox or Episcopalian or what
                    have you. This, in the 18th century, had been a cemetery for nonbelievers and
                    prostitutes, and it became sort of hallowed ground for the diplomatic community
                    because there were all kinds of interesting people buried there, like - I can't
                    remember if it was Keats or Shelley that was buried there - and various literary
                    figures. It was quite an amazing institution, and it was run by this council of
                    ambassadors. At a certain point, one of the early leaders of the Italian
                    Communist Party died, and his family wanted him to be buried in Testaccio
                    Cemetery because they couldn't get him into a Catholic cemetery and he had spent
                    many years in Russia, in the Soviet Union. So Reinhardt was absolutely
                    determined that he would not be buried in Testaccio Cemetery, and watching him
                    operate - and we all worked with him on this - watching him mount a campaign of
                    diplomatic persuasion and phone calls and moves and countermoves with the
                    Italian Foreign Ministry was really quite remarkable. It was politically astute
                    for the Christian Democratic-dominated Government of Italy to allow this to
                    happen, because these sort of early glimmerings of what would come into full
                    focus in the late '70s of a possible compromise - the compromesso storico, the
                    “historic compromise” between Catholic Italy and the Communist Party of Italy -
                    the early adumbrations of that were already occurring there in the '60s. So
                    various people who had ambitions were trying their damnedest - including the
                    President of Italy - to have us bury this guy in Testaccio Cemetery. Reinhardt
                    was determined that this wasn't going to happen, and he succeeded. He even
                    tracked down the guy who was head of the burial subcommittee, who was on leave -
                    the Swedish ambassador - and he was on leave in Sweden and they had no
                    forwarding address for him because he was up in the north woods in his cabin. So
                    Reinhardt somehow got a friend in the embassy [in Stockholm] to track him down
                    and get his vote, to prevent this from happening. Eventually this guy was dumped
                    in some unhallowed ground of the municipal cemetery. He was concerned that if it
                    happened that this burial spot would become a shrine for the Italian Communist
                    movement. Anyway, it didn't happen; he succeeded. It was quite marvelous.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How is your feeling on time? Should we maybe stop?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: At 11:00 I have to go.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, let's talk a bit about this. How did you view, both
                        working with the ambassador and then in the Political Section, our
                        involvement in the Italian political process? The percentages of change
                        seemed so damn small for about 30 years practically after the '48 election
                        and all. It seemed that we got awfully involved at a pretty minor level as
                        far as reporting on the local nuances of Italian politics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: You're absolutely right. That's another striking difference between what
                    is considered important today, in terms of political reporting, and what was
                    considered important then. We had a large political section. We had one officer
                    who devoted full time to reporting on the Christian Democratic movement, who
                    would sometimes get a little help from other junior officers because he also had
                    to cover the Vatican. We had another officer reporting on the Socialist Party
                    and the social democratic movement, another one on the right, and then there was
                    the political counselor himself. So we probably had four or five people that
                    were reporting on Italian politics, and then somebody reporting on the Communist
                    Party. Of course we weren't allowed to have any contact with them. We had a very
                    large CIA section, with officers who had cover as diplomats and who were
                    accredited, and some very experienced Italian hands there, who were practically
                    bilingual in Italian and really knew the place - in the Agency's section.</p>
                <p>My work at that time was largely political-military because we had probably 60
                    bases and installations throughout Italy, and there were all kinds of
                    status-of-forces problems, and there was a lot to do.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0054" n="Page0054"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's always struck me - I'm speaking now, I was consul
                        general in Naples in the '79-81 period and I had been outside the area - and
                        I was always struck by how we were reporting on the minutiae of politics
                        there, and really not a hell of a lot had changed. It just seemed like we'd
                        gotten caught up in this Rome-centric dance that went on, by the politicians
                        there. It was beginning to change, but earlier on it must have... Did you
                        have the feeling of sort of maybe we're overdoing this? Or were we so caught
                        up with it that we didn't realize it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I did not have a view that we were overdoing it, no. I think probably
                    it's because the American stakes in what happened to Italy were very important
                    in World War II and the immediate aftermath of World War II, and I had been sort
                    of brought up with that realization, beginning with my father's role working as
                    the civil affairs chief for Eisenhower. My dad played a major role, and
                    Eisenhower and Bedell Smith agreed with him, in persuading... Major role - I
                    mean, he proposed the idea of turning Italy into a co-belligerent against Nazi
                    Germany. This was not easy to do because the allied strategic goal was
                    unconditional surrender of all the Axis powers. My father was persuaded that it
                    would take so many divisions to garrison Italy, and we were struggling to
                    assemble an invasion force sufficient to do the job in Normandy. It just didn't
                    make any sense to him, nor did it to Eisenhower. It took two runs to Roosevelt
                    and Churchill to allow them to then proceed with a plan to put in Badoglio.
                    Badoglio was very nervous because the German Army was not that far north. The
                    condition that Roosevelt and Churchill put down was that he would have to
                    declare himself publicly on the side of the allies against Nazi Germany, and he
                    was very nervous about that. But that finally happened.</p>
                <p>So early on I had a kind of a dose of the importance of the Italian boot, and
                    then afterwards, when Jimmy Dunn, who was a friend of my father's, was
                    ambassador there in '48, it was a critical turning point - as you'll recall -
                    when the referendum after the war, as to whether or not to become a republic or
                    to remain a kingdom, it barely passed for the establishment of the democratic
                    republic. It carried because the south voted largely to retain the kingdom, and

                    Communist Party. It was a close vote. Then, with a lot of help from us... There
                    was a movement to basically turn Italy to the Communist world, and Dunn played a
                    big role in that in 1948, preventing that from happening. So it was always in
                    people's minds. It was a very strong party. The Communist movement in Italy was
                    huge. They had played a role, the partisans-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, on the political-military side, how did you find the
                        military fit in - I mean our military - because I've often heard people say
                        that sometimes dealing with the Pentagon was a lot worse than dealing with a
                        foreign country in which you're stationed?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, it's interesting that you say that because I can recall an
                    incident. I was a young officer. I was a very eager political-military affairs
                    officer, and the ambassador was very concerned about, basically, keeping control
                    of the US military and where they were and what they were doing and getting his
                    permission to carry out certain activities in the country. My boss and I were
                    very attuned to that, and so I discovered at one point that there was an
                    unauthorized Seventh Army unit operating in Italy, one that had not sought-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Seventh Army being stationed up in Heidelberg.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Up in Heidelberg. But this was Italy. We had a lot of forces, of course,
                    in Vicenza and Verona and Pisa and all over the place. We carefully kept track
                    of all these because also we were the sort of linchpin with the Italian
                    authorities, with the Ministry of Defense to make sure that we were operating
                    with complete approval by the Italian authorities. We had very good deal in
                    Italy, and we didn't want to disturb that. So at one point I discovered a unit
                    which had not been declared to us, and it was a purchasing operation to purchase
                    fresh fruits and vegetables for the forces in Germany, so I exposed this. It
                    turned out that I blew the cover of an Army Intelligence operation, which did
                    not please the Pentagon very much. The ambassador was basically... They didn't
                    have his permission to do that either, and he recognized that people were pretty
                    sore in Washington, but in a way he was sort of pleased that I had done this. He
                    said, “Next time, check it out a little bit more carefully.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At that time how did you find our status-of-forces
                        agreement working with the Italians?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: It worked pretty well. The Italians - and I had a second experience with
                    that later, when I went back as deputy chief of mission - basically were very
                    good hosts. You had to work at it and keep them informed and, oh, seek their
                    authorization even though you knew it was almost automatic but it was just a
                    question of diplomatic politeness. But they basically worked pretty well. We had
                    amazing access in Italian ports for nuclear powered ships and even for ships
                    that had nuclear weapons on board. The Italians, it didn't trouble them at all
                    that we exercised the policy of neither confirming nor denying the presence of
                    nuclear weapons on our ships. At one point we had access to as many as six ports
                    in Italy, in the Adriatic and the Tyrrhenian.</p>

                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, particularly when they had an opportunity to deploy their labor
                    forces, to have strikes. That was their major weapon. Or if we made a mistake,
                    they would exploit that. Of course, a famous one in later years was when we
                    pursued the terrorists that had attacked the Achille Lauro, you know? We forced
                    them down in Sigonella, and then there was a standoff because we share a base
                    there with the Italian Air Force. There was a standoff between our people and
                    the Italian forces. That was embarrassing. That kind of incident obviously was
                    always a setback, which is why we had a two-man political-military section
                    working full-time on keeping everything regular, seeking approval where we
                    needed to, keeping the Italians informed, and most of all tracking our own
                    military to make sure that they did what they were required to do and
                    coordinated on all of these things.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I cant recall now in any detail, but there were, as part of the
                    status-of-forces arrangements, there were tax problems, and there were disputes
                    about what was exempt and what wasn't, and we would have our lawyers sit down
                    together and hammer it out. Some of those discussions went on for months, if not

                        still in Italy, '63-67, in your political-military time there, what was your
                        impression that you were getting both from your own experience and from what
                        you were hearing from our American military colleagues, about the Italian
                        military at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, you mean about the quality of the Italian military?</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Certainly Italian military leaders were, I would say, extremely
                    responsive to the United States and to NATO in general. It was important to
                    them, they knew, to be on good terms with the leader of the Alliance in the
                    Alliance, not only from what they could learn from the association in terms of
                    training and strategy, but also in terms of resources, because that meant that
                    they could, in trying to align the military equipment of the Alliance along
                    compatible systems, it was in Italy's interest to tap into that system of
                    systems, if you will. The quality of the military - certain units were of
                    extremely high quality. Certainly the Alpini, the Alpine troops, the
                    Bersaglieri, the fellows that wear the wonderful green plumes that fluttered on
                    the side - they were a crack unit. Certainly the Italian Navy frogmen - a long
                    tradition going back to-</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Right, in World War II. Their paratroopers were first-rate. They had
                    excellent fighter bomber pilots, and they certainly participated to the full in
                    their combined NATO activities in the Mediterranean and obviously in the
                    Tyrrhenian and the Adriatic working through AFSOUTH (Allied Forces South) in
                    Naples, working very closely with the United States, with Greece and Turkey, and
                    occasionally France. Despite the fact that that was the period when France was
                    leaving NATO, there were still French NATO exercises from time to time in the
                    Mediterranean.</p>

                        in Turkey than anything else. Were there any particular hang-ups that from
                        our perspective the Italians had in the Mediterranean world, or not, as far
                        as what they were concerned with and others weren't concerned with?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Not that I can remember. I do remember discussion with Italian military
                    leaders who had served at NATO headquarters but more particularly at AFSOUTH.
                    They shared almost the entire set of common headaches with us over squelching
                    small, medium, and large Greek-Turkish disputes and staying on schedule with
                    respect to exercises. They had the same frustrations that we had, but I can't
                    think of anything special.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I can't think of anything either. That's why I was asking,
                        because nations have their own interests and all. What was the feeling from
                        there, if it came up, towards Yugoslavia at that time? It was just basically
                        a buffer zone, or was it felt to be-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, it was really in the later period where Trieste became a land bridge
                    for daytime tourists, people coming over from Istria, that part of Yugoslavia,
                    to Trieste on day trips and then waddling back across the border wearing six and
                    seven pairs of jeans and whatever number of shirts and coats they could put on.
                    The Yugoslav authorities allowed them to go over to Italy for the day. They
                    could not come back with suitcases and packages filled with purchases, but they
                    could come back with anything that they could wear. So you saw these curious
                    stuffed individuals coming back across the border. That was beginning to happen
                    then. The Italians were watching with interest Yugoslavia's own experiment in
                    blended Communist-capitalism where they gradually allowed family-sized private
                    enterprise and then that succeeded, and it grew, and they allowed bigger
                    families - families would band together so you'd have all the cousins and aunts
                    and uncles, and before you knew it you had a small business enterprise underway.
                    The Italians watched that with great interest because it meant a growing
                    marketplace for their own economy, including their gray economy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, this is a thing. With the Italians, of course, the
                        gray economy is the one unreported. Maybe I mentioned it before - Naples
                        doesn't have a single registered glove factory, but when I was there it was
                        the glove capital of the world.HOLMES: The same could be said of shoes in
                        Tuscany or actual apparel, suits and sweaters and jackets the more you move
                        north in Italy. So the gray economy was a thriving business in Italy. Nobody
                        has ever succeeded in getting a very accurate estimate of the percentage of
                        the Italian economy, but I can remember estimates ranging from 18 to 30
                        percent, fluctuating, clearly. The Italians are extremely industrious
                        people; they just don't like to pay taxes.</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: People would talk about, oh, these people don't work, and
                        all. That was down in the south. This is 20 years later, but you'd go in
                        there in the cellars and everybody is stitching away. The thing is they're
                        not on their regular jobs; they're on their real job.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0059" n="Page0059"/>
                <p>HOLMES: That's correct. They were very cagey about it though. Italians were very
                    careful to acquire what they called copertura - 'coverage.' That meant that you
                    got a job either in a government agency or in a parastatal business, and through
                    that you got your health insurance and your retirement and the whole package of
                    benefits, and then you basically shaved your workday to the extent that you
                    could get away with it. If the workday was from nine to five, you'd show up
                    maybe at 10 and leave about 3, and then you went to your real job, your
                    productive job, where you were not reporting the income and you just made as
                    much money as you could and stashed it away. You didn't have to buy health
                    insurance or life insurance because that was all under the government copertura
                    system. So that was the way they operated.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in '67, whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: In 1967, I was assigned from Rome to go to Benghazi, which I was looking
                    forward to very much, but when we got back to Washington we encountered a
                    medical problem in the family, and it was strongly advised that we not go there,
                    that while our particular medical situation was under observation we were
                    strongly advised to have a stateside assignment for a couple of years or so to
                    watch this development. It was sort of a cancer scare. So we took that advice,
                    obviously, and stayed in Washington.</p>
                <p>Of course, I didn't have a job, but I managed in fairly short order to get a job
                    as the Benelux Desk officer, which was a lot of fun. It was my first and only
                    country officer detail, and I quickly found out that the secret to success with
                    my three client nations was I never referred to myself other than as the “Dutch
                    Desk officer” or the “Belgian Desk officer” or the “Luxembourg Desk officer,”
                    depending on who I was talking to. It was a very good assignment. I had a deputy
                    and a wonderful secretary. It was extraordinarily interesting if for no other
                    reason than general Eisenhower's son, John Eisenhower, was appointed while I was
                    there as the ambassador to Belgium, and so that brought me back into contact in
                    a more direct way with the Eisenhower family, which my father had been, of
                    course, very close to.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: I was in Washington from '67 to '70, for three years. I was the Benelux
                    Desk officer for about two years, basically, and then I was hired for a sort of
                    a crash program that lasted nine or ten months by Bill Macomber, who was then
                    undersecretary for management. I sort of organized and spearheaded and did the
                    legwork for - actually it was Bill Macomber who spearheaded it, but I did the
                    legwork - a searching analysis and review of the Foreign Service in every
                    respect from organization to policy. It was called Diplomacy for the 1970s. I'm
                    pretty sure that's what it was called, Diplomacy for the Seventies. So those are
                    basically the two assignments I had during that three-year stint in
                    Washington.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, let's start first with the Benelux Desk, for a tour
                        d'horizon. Belgium, '67-69. Eisenhower was their ambassador-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: During part of that time.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find him as an ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: John Eisenhower was a historian and wrote a very fine book centered
                    primarily on the Battle of the Bulge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Dark Wood, or something like that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I forget the name of it, but he was a good ambassador, of course had had
                    no prior... He'd been a career Army officer for, it think, 20 years or so, and
                    then-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Graduated, I think, around '45, just when his father-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Just at the end of the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At the end of the war, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                <p>HOLMES: He did a good job. He had a very strong understanding, obviously, of what
                    was happening in the cockpit of Europe and the significance of all the things
                    that were happening - the growth of the European Union, not known as such at the
                    time, the growth of the Common Market, the sort of seminal role of the Benelux
                    countries in that, the relationship to NATO. He was in a very good position to
                    observe all this. He was only one of three United States ambassadors in
                    Brussels, the other two being one to NATO and the other to USEC, the US mission
                    to the Economic Community. But he would join in happily in discussions on the
                    place of the Alliance in US policy towards Europe. Don't ask me about Belgian
                    politics because, one, I don't think it's particularly important. What's
                    important about Belgium at the time is, of course, the growing estrangement
                    among the linguistic communities, between the Flemings on the one hand, the
                    French-speaking Walloons, and then a sort of third set of actually the people
                    who lived in Brussels who spoke French but were frequently Flemish. There was a
                    growing insistence about cultural autonomy and the requirement that politicians,
                    government representatives, teachers have a facility in both languages, and all
                    of this was exacerbated by the economic plight of Wallonia. Wallonia was the
                    soft underdeveloped part of Belgium that needed and received help from the
                    European Community in terms of development. This exacerbated the tension between
                    that community and the wealthier, frequently more enterprising Flemings.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was the late De Gaulle period, I guess. He left in,
                        what was it, '68 or '69, I think he resigned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Was it '69? That's right. It was after the May, '68, student revolt in
                    Paris. I think you're right; I think it was after that that De Gaulle
                    resigned.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think I remember that he resigned in '69. Were we
                        concerned? Was France fishing in these troubled waters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because De Gaulle had certainly gotten mixed up in
                        Canada.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But this was something too close to home, maybe?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>HOLMES: No, they really weren't. Actually, in terms of linguistic communities,
                    the most important, interesting enterprise of the time, which started in 1963,
                    was the De Gaulle-Adenauer treaty, which spawned the most extraordinary
                    generational attempt among the French people and the German people to come
                    together, to create a sense of community. I think by the time I was assigned to
                    Paris, which was in 1970 - that was only seven years after the signing of this
                    treaty - there were at least 500 twinned cities between French and German
                    communities, so in terms of bringing together two linguistic communities, that
                    was a huge effort and one that De Gaulle committed himself to with real passion.
                    So I don't recall any fishing in Wallonian waters. The French-speaking
                    population of Belgium tended to look in some respects culturally to France.
                    Going way back they had a common history, but I wouldn't put too much emphasis
                    on that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the May of '68, the student thing, which was not just
                        confined to France but in other places - I mean the Benelux - was that
                        something of concern to us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, it happened. There was some spillover effect at Louvain and some of
                    the Belgian universities, but it certainly did not shake the ground. It didn't
                    have the same seismic effect in French-speaking Belgium as it did, obviously, in
                    France. What's the name of the student leader? Was it Cohn-Bendit?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, he's a deputy in the European parliament. I see him
                        on French TV all the time. “Red Danny.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Very respectable.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Very respectable. I thought he'd be some kind of socialist
                        or Green or something, but I think he's right behind bombing Serbia.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, that's usually the pattern. The young radicals end up being
                    conservators of something later in life.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what about... Did the king play any role, or did we
                        see this in Belgium, or was this a figurehead type thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>HOLMES: It's an interesting concept. The king of Belgium is not a traditional
                    monarch in the way that established monarchies have operated in other countries.
                    He was really always known as the king of the Belgians, and as such even
                    though... Salic Law, hereditary law, didn't really play out in Belgium the same
                    way it did in other countries. Successive kings of the Belgians had to achieve a
                    certain approval from the Belgian people, and I'm not quite sure
                    constitutionally - I can't remember how that happens except that the king of the
                    Belgians has a somewhat different status from other traditional monarchs. But
                    leaving that aside, his role was largely that of a figurehead head of state
                    certainly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any concerns that we had about Belgium at that
                        time that you can think of.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, not really. I remember there was an important Atlantic Alliance
                    summit that Belgium was host to. It happened in Brussels while I was the Desk
                    officer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Netherlands during this time? Was this the
                        time when mobs were stoning our consulate general in Amsterdam over the
                        Vietnam War, or did this come a little later?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, you could always count on that kind of activity on an almost routine
                    basis happening in Amsterdam and Rotterdam. The Dutch were a wealthy country and
                    probably the most compact in terms of the size of the population to the size of
                    the national territory. I think that the density of population in the
                    Netherlands, the equivalent in the United States would be that we could have
                    housed the entire population of the world. That gives you an idea. The Dutch
                    really live like sardines and have a remarkable political discourse among
                    themselves that doesn't lead to violence. The Dutch are fond of saying that
                    every man has an opinion. Two people together constitute an embryonic political
                    party. They have a very vigorous democracy, wealthy. Rotterdam, the biggest port
                    in the world, including all of the POL that comes in and out of the place. But
                    in terms of total tonnage of goods including POL, the biggest port in the
                    world.</p>
                <p>Yes, there were demonstrations against our policy in Vietnam, yes, but again,
                    there were no particular problems with the Netherlands at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did we sort of take it as a given that in these Western
                        European countries when you were there that Vietnam was going to be
                        something they felt we were over-obsessed with and we weren't going to get
                        very strong support, and that was just the way it was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, that view evolved and became more strident almost as a reflection,
                    politically and in terms of the media, of what was happening in the United
                    States. It was a transferred emotion and political attitude.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about for you? I mean for most of us, when we serve
                        abroad, we're not aware of the political forces that are going on in the
                        United States. We read about it, but we don't get that same feedback. Did
                        you find, say, on Vietnam, that this was impacting on you and your wife and
                        all that at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, very directly, yes. First of all, I was always surprised and
                    relieved that I wasn't picked through the personnel system to go to serve in
                    Vietnam during the war. I had fluent French, I had a Marine infantry officer
                    background, I had requested French-speaking Southeast Asia as my first
                    assignment, but the personnel system never came up with my name for Vietnam. I
                    would have had a real professional life crisis had that occurred. I was strongly
                    opposed to our policy in Vietnam, not along the usual lines that you frequently
                    encounter of sort of moral position, but from the point of view of United States
                    national interest. I had spent too much time as a graduate student in Paris in
                    1957-58 studying the French experience in Southeast Asia, and I could see a
                    pattern that we were about to relive. I mean, I predicted a lot of the things
                    that happened just because I had so studied the French experience that I knew it
                    would happen. I knew it was not in our national interest. I also knew enough
                    about the Viet Minh/Viet Cong and the North Vietnamese to know that this was a
                    very strongly-felt nationalistic movement which was also communist. We were
                    bound to lose it. I thought it was a terrible error on our part to get involved
                    to the extent that we did, so I sort of dreaded the day that I would get a
                    telegram from the Department assigning me to Vietnam. I didn't know what I would
                    do about it. I knew one thing with absolute certainty - that if I received such
                    an assignment I would not try to get out of it. I had too much respect for my
                    fellow Foreign Service officers who didn't like the assignment very much either
                    but who went and did their turn. So I would not have played games and tried to
                    get out of it. I would either have gone, biting my tongue, or I would have
                    resigned from the Foreign Service. To this day I don't know which way I would
                    have gone, but I had done enough thinking about it to know that if the day came,
                    that would be my choice.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to Holland. From an American policy point of view,
                        was Belgium one nation and Holland another? I'm not being facetious, but did
                        we have sort of different... or did we lump them together?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, Belgium and Holland are two very different nations. We had the same
                    Desk officer, but we handled them very differently and the issues were not the
                    same. Where there was some lumping together was between Belgium and Luxembourg.
                    I mean, they had the same currency, they had the same language - other than, of
                    course, the Luxemburger Germanic tongue that was spoken as a second language -
                    but we worked very hard at treating them as individual nations while, at the
                    same time, recognizing that they were the core group, of course, of the European
                    experiment - the Common Market as it developed in different configurations.</p>

                        at one point one of the major issues with the Dutch, close to this time, was
                        landing rights for KLM. Did that come up, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, it did. You really know your history. I'm impressed. Yes, the KLM
                    was very aggressive, and I remember particularly they were intent on getting
                    into Chicago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Absolutely.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: That was a long negotiation, and we did get something in return, but it
                    was very hard fought, absolutely.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course, it's one of the most difficult things, because
                        generally the State Department kind of wants, well, this is fine; we want to
                        have good relations with this country. But then you get your very powerful
                        commercial interests in the United States saying “Keep them furriners
                        [foreigners] out of our turf.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you were at the guts of the European Community
                        that was developing, what was the feeling? Was it pretty well on track and
                        all at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Do you mean the growth of the Community? Oh, yes. Absolutely. But of
                    course, they were struggling with... the same problem countries that exist today
                    for the Community - will the French eventually go to a common currency? It was
                    hard enough just agreeing on fixed bands of fluctuation among the salad of
                    European currencies. I mean that was one of the early battles that was fought,
                    over the currency. Of course, today we have the Euro, which, quite honestly, I
                    would never have believed that it would be possible before the end of this
                    century to have the Euro actually emerge, given the early fierce battles over
                    something as preliminary as fixed bands in the currency market place among the
                    basket of European currencies. But that was a major struggle, but it was on
                    course. The French were very nervous about the Germans. Their national goal, in

                <p>Several years later, probably about four years later, while serving as political
                    counselor in Paris, I had an opportunity to have about a 15-minute conversation
                    with the President of France, which was unusual, at a dinner party, and he
                    talked openly about the French economic goal of overtaking German GNP. The other
                    thing - to give you just a kind of an idea of the difficulty of evolving the
                    European Union - he had campaigned on bringing France more organically into the
                    European Union at a certain point, and he barnstormed in the north and the
                    eastern part of France, and he had just returned from that campaign to Paris the
                    evening of the dinner party. I asked him what his impressions were, and he said,
                    “The roads run parallel to the border.” Which I thought was very symbolic - and
                    he meant it to be - of how difficult it was to overcome the attitudes of small
                    communities scattered along the northern and eastern borders of France.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: -corn glutinate and soy glutinate as feed for cattle. We grew it very
                    cheaply, and this was a matter of great concern to the highly protectionist
                    agricultural marketplace in Europe, not only in France but other places as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As the development of the European Union, were we watching
                        the farming communities as being probably one of the most difficult ones to
                        break up, and also this was where our market was. I would have thought we
                        would be watching it with great care.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, we did watch it, and we weren't the only ones. So did every
                    political leader in western Europe. When Fran�ois Mitterrand came back and
                    pulled the large socialist family back together again, one of his greatest
                    challenges was southwestern France, because socialists are supposed to be
                    liberal, and yet what he encountered among that largely farming community was
                    deep conservatism, and protection of the farmers was almost a hallowed canon of
                    French politics. That complicated his task; he just had to accept that.</p>

                        Army and the German Army and to some extent the British Army, but Benelux
                        doesn't get much play. How were they as NATO people?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0067" n="Page0067"/>
                <p>HOLMES: They have been very strong NATO supporters all along, I would say the
                    Dutch stronger than the Belgians, I would say more respected as military
                    professionals than the Belgians. Dutch fighter-bomber squadrons were highly
                    regarded, and it's interesting to note that in practically every engagement,
                    including today in the bombing runs over Yugoslav, over Serbia, that Dutch
                    pilots are there, and they're first-class. And also they hosted important bases
                    for the United States and for NATO, and later, when we deployed the cruise
                    missiles, the INF, the great INF strategic gamble, the Dutch signed up right
                    away and allowed Cruise missiles to be stationed in their national
                    territory.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's interesting because the Dutch do... at least they had
                        almost a professional protest group that seemed to come out a lot. Did we
                        consider, were we concerned in that time about any shakiness on the part of
                        the Dutch as far as the Alliance was concerned?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Not really. Every once in a while there was a little tremor of concern
                    that ran through official Washington at the thought that some of the more
                    radical Dutch parties would put such pressure on their government as to require
                    us to remove our special ammunition sites, the nuclear weapon storage facilities
                    that we had for our aircraft, and also the dual-key nuclear weapons that were
                    available to Dutch squadrons that were basically committed, assigned, to NATO.
                    So every once in a while that bothered people, and they watched it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because it was always very visible, Dutch crowds, when
                        they would come out. They're usually long-haired kids, and they painted
                        themselves and - you know - it was good TV.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, the Dutch have always been in the forefront of new ideas and new
                    movements. Certainly, for a while, if not the legalization, the tolerance of
                    drugs. There was a vigorous drug culture in Amsterdam, other than the criminal
                    element - and of course the Dutch police didn't like it much, but that happened.
                    It was certainly there in terms of Catholic theology. Perhaps the most advanced
                    liberal Catholic Church in Europe, centered mostly at Louvain. They had been in
                    the forefront of authorizing euthanasia. I mean, you can just find throughout
                    current Dutch history a number of issues where they've been sort of way ahead of
                    the most experimental parts of the Western community.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, Luxembourg certainly had great reverence of the United States, and
                    at the big American cemetery there was a tradition that every American grave was
                    adopted by a Luxemburger family. It was very touching.</p>

                        developments in France at the time, because this was a time when you had
                        your May of '68, but you also had De Gaulle sort of in his last days,
                        throwing down challenges internally. Was there reflected concern about
                        France?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: They certainly, as partners of the French in the European Community,
                    observed; their diplomats in France reported on developments. I never sensed
                    that they were deeply disturbed. I think they liked the fact - particularly a
                    country like Belgium, which had a system of proportional representation, which
                    meant that it was very difficult to keep coalition governments together very
                    long... they looked enviously at the new French experiment brought in by the
                    Fifth Republic and Charles De Gaulle and Michel Debr�, when they set up the new
                    hybrid system where they went from pure proportional representation to
                    single-member districts; and they admired that, and they thought it was good.
                    The institutional transformation in French politics that took place as a result
                    of that, they looked enviously at that. I think we're basically comforted by
                    that development.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Communist Parties there? The Communist
                        Parties are always a concern. Say, France had a fairly substantial one;
                        Italy had almost a third or a quarter. What about Communist Parties?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: It wasn't a matter of great concern or an issue. I think, again, that
                    thoughtful political analysts in the Benelux countries followed and looked
                    anxiously at the developments of the communist parties in western Europe. I
                    think some people were pleased by the emergence of Euro-Communism, that softer
                    brand of Communism that wore a friendlier face. Not true in Portugal, certainly,
                    but very much the case in both Italy and later on in France.</p>

                    problems usually had to do with the “Greek footnote.”</p>

                        well, then, let's talk about this “diplomacy for the '70s.” Could you
                        explain what Macomber was after and your impression.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Basically Macomber's kind of philosophy was to reform and yank the
                    Foreign Service into the modern era, preparing for the '70s and the '80s, to
                    avoid having us be reorganized yet again by some outside group. So his concept
                    was, we the professionals - and he considered himself a professional, even
                    though he was a political appointee - he'd been around, and he was a very
                    thoughtful diplomatist - but he said, basically, If we get the right people, the
                    best people, the leaders of the Foreign Service, we can do a better job of
                    identifying those things which need to be evolved and changed within the Foreign
                    Service than an outside group. The concept was to develop - and I can't remember
                    exactly the number, but we had maybe 13 or 14 task forces - and the concept was,
                    if we go to the personnel system and ask them to assign people, we'll get people
                    who are not assigned because perhaps they aren't the best. We wanted the best.
                    We wanted people who were leaders, and so we did it on a part-time basis. The
                    idea was we would reach out and pick, and then go and shmooze people to lend
                    themselves to this effort, and they would give a certain number of hours a week
                    to the effort so that we would get very strong people involved in the process.
                    It worked pretty well. There were some signed up that you really had to do a lot
                    of phoning to try to make them come to meetings, but actually we came up with a
                    lot of ideas and institutional reform which made good sense. The easy ones were
                    picked off and adopted, and of course the difficult ones languished and were
                    encountered years afterwards in subsequent reform efforts.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Late '60s. The young Turks were obviously the kind of the point of the
                    spear. They were kind of out ahead of others, but there was, I would say, a
                    general confluence of thinking between that group and the diplomacy for the '70s
                    group, but it was easier for them to reach out and make pronouncements and push
                    the institution. It was a pretty good effort, and they had more than one hearing
                    in the building.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, it was, of course, a time when young people were
                        looking at... there was a feeling of change in the air, and all. In a way,
                        there was a feeling that one could change systems. Can you think of any of
                        the particularly difficult problems that you wrestled with?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, one in particular that I remember, and I believe it was
                    incorporated in the Diplomacy for the '70s was... The Foreign Service always
                    prided itself on being a disciplined career - not as rigid as the military,
                    certainly - but with a fairly strong top-down system of command and control and
                    guidance, and there was a concern among a lot of us - and I was one of them -
                    that not too frequently, for the sake of convenience and comfort and ease,
                    policies towards certain issues and certain countries and certain organizations
                    tended to get frozen, and subsequent administrations would come in, and it was
                    seen as a convenience also to maintain certain relationships. So what we wanted
                    to do was to free up the creative energies of substantive officers, mostly
                    political and economic officers, obviously, to have the courage to speak up and
                    push ideas, even unpopular ones, and so we set up a Dissent Channel. I don't
                    know if you remember that.Q: Oh, very much so.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>HOLMES: But that was hotly debated, but we stuck with our guns on it and got it
                    through. I actually had an interesting experience with that. When I was DCM in
                    Rome we were struggling with the problem with the compromesso storico, the
                    “historic compromise” between Catholic and Communist Italy. The ambassador,
                    Richard Gardner, was strongly opposed to this, as was most of Washington, and we
                    had one political officer in our Political Section who thought that we were
                    making a huge mistake to lean so strongly on the Italians, that this was a
                    natural evolution and that it would draw the Communists into the more
                    traditional, respectable part of political discourse in Italy. I remember that
                    Dick Gardner went back on consultations just at a time when we were about to
                    make a major representation to the Italian Government. We feared at the time
                    moving too quickly in that direction, and Gardner went back in consultations and
                    was talking with Brzezinski, and this guy on our staff came up with a Dissent
                    message. I read it, and it was totally at variance. It was a tremendous
                    challenge to our policy, and I was delighted to send it in. It hit Washington,
                    and within about an hour, I had an enraged Dick Gardner on the phone saying that
                    he'd been stabbed in the back and that this was outrageous that an ambassador
                    was in consultation and a member of his staff would jump ship. I said, well,
                    we'll talk about this when you get back, and I explained to him the history of
                    this. The idea here was to stir up vigorous new ideas that would challenge the
                    status quo. Actually, when he came back and he'd settled down and had sat down
                    and talked with the officer, he rather liked it - afterwards. But that was a
                    turning point also, frankly, in the way we organized our evaluation system. I
                    believe it was at that time when we began to insist that in every evaluation
                    there had to be an “area for improvement,” if you remember, that had to be noted
                    and documented and talked about. Embassies and bureaus in the State Department
                    were instructed not to allow cop-outs. There were review panels that would send
                    back reports that simply said, “so-and-so should go off and learn an exotic
                    language.” I think that in terms of the promotion system and rewarding
                    professionalism and a certain intellectual boldness, these are two elements that
                    were introduced as reforms that I think made a difference in terms of
                    encouraging and rewarding intellectual courage.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, you saw the publication of this before
                        you-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, I did. I did see the publication of it just as I was leaving. I was
                    in that job for about nine months, and then I was assigned to Paris. As the
                    Benelux Desk officer, I had been in the same Office of West European Affairs,
                    which basically was Benelux and France, and so I and the French Desk officer
                    worked for the same boss, and so nine months later I was recruited to go to the
                    Political Section in Paris, where I headed up a small internal political unit
                    within the Political Section that concentrated on France, on French politics,
                    labor relations, that sort of thing. We were a subsection of about four
                    people.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Before we move to that, I would like to ask your
                        impression of working for Bill Macomber because his temper was
                        well-renowned, but he was also an innovative person. How did you find
                        working for him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I liked working for Bill Macomber. He was very energetic, sparked a lot
                    of ideas. Not all of them were great, but some of them were excellent, and he
                    released a lot of energy among the people that he came in contact with. He did
                    have a temper, he was difficult. You just had to stand up to him. I noticed that
                    people that allowed themselves to be bullied continued to be bullied. At a
                    certain point in developing a relationship with Bill, you just had to establish
                    who you were and what you would tolerate and what you wouldn't. But I think he
                    was a very creative guy. I think he was one of the best under secretaries for
                    Management we've had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I remember just a very small detail. When I went out to
                        Athens to be consul general, he had me to his office and some members of the
                        family and swore me in. I mean the idea was to boost the idea of the
                        consular side of things.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, yes, he felt passionately about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's something I'll always remember because most of the
                        time nobody gave a damn anyway. This was not just a gesture. It was
                        important.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No he had very strong leadership qualities, and he also cared, despite
                    his gruff exterior. He was a very compassionate individual, sensitive to
                    people's needs. He's the guy that set up an ombudsman to hear personnel disputes
                    and problems. He had somebody in his office whose position was publicized and to
                    whom employees could turn in a very private way to unload, basically, their
                    problem and their grievances. It had a tremendous effect within the Department.
                    I'll always remember, the guy that was first assigned to that was Robert C. F.
                    Gordon, a wonderful Foreign Service officer who had actually been my boss for
                    part of that first period in Rome. Bob was progressively blind, and by the time
                    he got this job he was almost entirely blind, and he was a wonderful,
                    compassionate, understanding leader. I remember an African American woman came
                    to see him and talked to him about her problems, and he gave her a lot of good
                    advice, gave her a tremendous hearing. She commented at the end of this that
                    this had meant so much to her, that she could actually go and talk to someone in
                    authority, in the senior reaches of the Department and get a fair hearing and
                    know that she would not be burned, that it would be kept confidential. Then at
                    the end she said, “And to know that you treated me just like any other person.
                    You had no idea that you were talking to an African American woman, because you
                    couldn't see me.” It was a very poignant moment. That was Bill Macomber. It was
                    one of the things he institutionalized. He thought of it and-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think he's one of the seminal figures in the
                        administration of the State Department. You were in Paris from when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES. From 1970 to 1974.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was our ambassador when you arrived?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: When I arrived the ambassador was leaving, and that was President
                    Kennedy's brother-in-law, Sargent Shriver, who was just departing at that point.
                    The new ambassador, who was sent there by President Nixon, was Dick Watson, who
                    was the younger brother of Tom Watson, both of them sons of the founder of
                    IBM.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How was Ambassador Watson? I mean what was your impression
                        of him?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, Ambassador Watson - by the way he spoke very good French and played
                    a significant role in putting IBM on the world map; I mean he was really in
                    charge of its international operations - came to Paris with a singular mission.
                    He'd had discussions with the President, and his mission, as he told us from the
                    moment he got to Paris, was to close down the heroin labs in Marseilles, so that
                    the pollution of American youth, particularly in New York, would cease. This was
                    the much-ballyhooed “French connection.” That was his mission, and he felt very
                    strongly about it. This was what the President had spoken to him about, and all
                    these other traditional Foreign Service diplomatic roles were not unimportant,
                    but they were definitely of secondary importance, and this was his goal, to
                    achieve this. This unleashed quite a tidal wave of activity in the embassy, and
                    he brought everybody into it. We had one DEA agent who was assigned to the
                    embassy, and it was quite a big undertaking because he quickly discerned, after
                    talking with the French Government, particularly the Ministry of the Interior,
                    that there was really no interest in the French Government to do anything
                    serious about this, that the feeling was this was an American problem and it was
                    a demand problem, not a supply problem, primarily. They thought it was greatly
                    exaggerated. Yes, there may be some criminal activity in Marseilles, but this
                    was really an American problem. Watson and a number of us had many long
                    discussions about how to turn the French around, because unless we had their
                    cooperation there was no way that we could make any progress. So the USIS
                    representatives suggested at one point, “Why don't we talk to French television
                    and see if they're interested in using some of the material that we have, some
                    films about what happens to children when they shoot up, and drug addiction and
                    so forth?” We tried that, and I was very skeptical that we would get a hearing
                    with French television, and they said, no, they weren't interested because
                    having viewed the films, they said, “This won't have any impact on French
                    audiences because this is very clearly an American setting and these are
                    American kids, and it's obvious.” But one man in the French television said, “If
                    you will show us the places in France where this sort of activity is taking
                    place, we'll make our own film and show it.” Well, again, we were very
                    skeptical, but the DEA guy took a small French crew around to parts of Paris and
                    Lille and Marseilles and several large cities in France, and sure enough, they
                    actually produced a film and showed it on French television. This caused a
                    firestorm of response from the French electorate, and all of a sudden the French
                    Government got interested in cooperating with us. There were all sorts of
                    discussion that took place, and eventually an agreement was signed between the
                    minister of the interior or the minister of Justice and our attorney general
                    that we would work with them in trying to close down the heroin labs, which were
                    mostly the Corsican mafia. The morphine base was coming into Marseilles from
                    Afghanistan and Turkey, largely, and there was transformed into heroin, and from
                    there it went through a variety of channels to the United States.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>Well, we then had started a period of cooperation, and nothing came of it,
                    largely because the police that were assigned to work with us in Marseilles were
                    on the take, and they were frequently Corsican cousins of those who were
                    actually in the trade. So then the French Government decided that they would
                    send a non-Corsican very highly regarded police officer from Paris who had
                    devised a way of producing... There had been a lot of bank robberies, and this
                    man had devised a way of prediction where the next bank robbery would take place
                    and was very successful, and so they thought that he might be able to use this
                    methodology in Marseilles. So he went to Marseilles, and again, there was no
                    reaction, primarily because he was frozen out by the local cops.</p>
                <p>So one day, sitting in a staff meeting... We had a wonderful science attach�, who
                    was a distinguished professor, and older man with white hair, who spoke up, “You
                    know, it takes a lot of water to turn morphine base into heroin. Has anybody
                    ever thought of checking the utility bills of the various villas in and around
                    Marseilles?” So this very sensible idea actually broke the case. I mean it was
                    incredible. The French police got onto that, and sure enough, within weeks they
                    had busted dozens of these laboratories that were in villas scattered around the
                    Marseilles area. This was a huge success, and it basically started us on the
                    road to breaking the French connection.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's wonderful. Who was the head of the Political
                        Section when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Bob Anderson was the head of the Political Section, Robert Anderson, who
                    had been my boss in the Office of West European Affairs in the State
                    Department.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: If I recall, I've talked to people who've served in
                        France, and I think they point to Bob Anderson's political section as being
                        one of the premier ones at any time of people, including yourself, who were
                        there. Did you have that feeling, that you were with a particularly elite
                        group?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, Bob spent a lot of time recruiting good officers for that section,
                    and those that handled all the international portfolios, and we had an officer
                    that dealt with west European questions, another one that dealt with NATO
                    questions, another officer that dealt with Asian-Pacific questions, another one
                    on Africa and the Middle East, a labor attach�. It was a very large section,
                    very energetic people that he inspired, that he pushed very hard to get out and
                    do their jobs. It was fun. I mean people were excited about the work that they
                    were doing there, and Bob knew France. He had served there several times and
                    spoke good French and his wife was fluent in French and they had a lot of French
                    friends and entertained a lot. They knew a lot of senior political leaders, and
                    he encouraged me to get out and find out what was going on, and of course the
                    Socialists were in opposition.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>We were not allowed to talk to the Communists, as was the case in most European
                    countries, but the Socialists were a kind of a radical group, so I was trying to
                    meet people in the Socialist Party, and I met the future minister of defense of
                    France, a guy named Charles Hernu. I used to go over to the Socialist Party
                    headquarters and talk with him and took him to lunch a couple of times. I
                    discovered at a certain juncture that he was also a contact of one of my Agency
                    counterparts at the embassy, which could have been very embarrassing, but the
                    two of us worked it out and made it very clear to Hernu that we were friends. I
                    think probably Hernu understood what was going on, but he never revealed it.</p>
                <p>But I still had a hard time getting my arms around the French socialist movement.
                    I had a lucky break. I knew a lot of French journalists, and one man in
                    particular who wrote for a left-wing magazine called Nouvelle Observateur called
                    me up one day and invited me and my wife to an informal lunch at his little
                    cottage in the country. He said, “We will be a small group, next Sunday, and you
                    probably won't know one of the people there, a sort of forgotten figure from the
                    Fourth Republic named Fran�ois Mitterrand.” I said, “Oh, I know who he is. I
                    spent a year at the Sciences-Politiques, and certainly I'd be delighted.” So we
                    went for this lunch, and Mitterrand was accompanied by one of his young
                    admirers, an attractive young woman, and we had a lot of interesting discussions
                    at the table, and I asked him a lot of questions about his politics and his
                    views. He was showing off a little bit in front of his... the young woman who
                    was with him. We spent probably three or four hours at table, and later we had a
                    long walk afterwards. Mitterrand basically laid out his Mein Kampf, his plan for
                    coming to power in France. It was quite extraordinary, because at the time he
                    was a kind of forgotten figure from the Fourth Republic. He headed a small
                    little splinter group called the Convention of Republican Institutions, and he
                    was very specific. He said, “In a few weeks I'm going to call my party into a
                    special congress. I'm going to ask their permission to join the greater
                    socialist family, to reintegrate into the Socialist Party. They will give me
                    that authority. I will then go next spring to a little town called Epinay, where
                    the great socialist family will come together, the party. I will have about a
                    hundred delegates of the thousand, and I will emerge as the first secretary of
                    the Socialist Party with a program of cooperation with the Communist Party
                    intact. Using that as a platform, we will increase our numbers in the National
                    Assembly, and then after that I will run for president and I will become
                    president of France.” I mean he laid it all out - it was absolutely incredible -
                    in detail. I went home that night, and I wrote a little memo to myself, to the
                    files, and I just tucked it away. When I left France several years later, about
                    three years later, reassigned, he had achieved every step. I went to Epinay, by
                    the way. I went to that congress on the weekend and watched him operate. It was
                    quite extraordinary. He did exactly what he said he was going to do, and he'd
                    achieved every goal except that he hadn't become president of France because the
                    first time he failed, in his first run for the presidency of France. Quite an
                    extraordinary figure and great fun for me, I must say.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As soon as you say the word Communist, I would have
                        thought that would set off all sorts of warning bells and “Don't touch this
                        man” and all that.</hi>

                <p>HOLMES: Oh, it did, it did, it absolutely did. It was a great concern in
                    Washington, and they were very suspicious of Mitterrand. They did not believe
                    what he was saying, that the only way to control the Communists in France was to
                    bring them into the government. They thought that he would be taken over by them
                    and that basically Moscow would tell him what to do and so forth. All this came
                    into very sharp focus in about March of 1981. This was about 10 years later.
                    President Reagan had been elected, and the first trip of a senior member of his
                    Administration to Europe was taken by George Bush, who was the Vice President.
                    This was about March. He had two places to go. One was to go to Paris because
                    they were really worried because the French under Mitterrand had put together a
                    government that had Communist ministers in the government, and you can imagine
                    this very conservative American Administration was worried about that. I was, at
                    the time, the senior deputy assistant secretary for European affairs. My boss
                    was Larry Eagleburger, and Larry had other things to do, and he asked me to go
                    with the Vice President on the trip. So 10 years later this thing was all coming
                    into focus, and I went on the trip with the Vice President. He invited me to sit
                    with him up in the cabin on the way over, and we talked a lot about what was
                    happening in France, and he asked me how he should handle this Communist
                    problem. I told him that it was important that he be very clear with Mitterrand
                    about the concerns of the US Government but that we had to be careful not to
                    intervene too openly in the process. We did have some private conversation with
                    Mitterrand so that he would understand that we would be required to say some
                    things publicly that might be not appreciated in France. He said, “Well, why do
                    we need to do that?” and I said, “Well, because the Italians will be watching
                    how we handle this because we'd just been through this period of the almost
                    historic compromise between Catholic and Communist Italy, and the Italians will
                    be very surprised if we go and say nothing.” He said, “Won't that be very
                    insulting to the president of France to have lunch with him and then on the
                    steps of the Elys�e to say some disobliging things to the French press?” I said,
                    “Yes, so my advice to you is that at the end of the lunch you and Mitterrand go
                    off and have coffee together in a separate room, and you tell him what you want
                    to say so there are no surprises.” And that's exactly what happened. The
                    fascinating thing is we went right from the airport to the Elys�e, and we
                    arrived as the first cabinet meeting with French Communist ministers in the
                    government was leaving the Elys�e, and we arrived and went in and had lunch with
                    Mitterrand. There were about 10 of us around the table. Mitterrand spent almost
                    the entire meal describing his plan of how he was going to “suffocate” the
                    Communists by bringing them into the government and forcing them to do things,
                    to participate in French government policy that was basically anathema to
                    Communist doctrine. I watched the Vice President as he went through this
                    explanation, and he was extremely skeptical. By dessert you could see that he
                    was beginning to think that this man might be able to do something. He was
                    beginning to listen. Afterwards he and Mitterrand went into a side room, they
                    had coffee together, and on the steps of the Elys�e Bush said just enough of a
                    note of displeasure about the United States's great ally France having
                    Communists in the government. He didn't overdo it. It was very deftly done. It
                    caused some predictable commentary in the French press, but the Italian press
                    reported it big-time. But, of course, we all know what happened afterwards. I
                    mean, Mitterrand succeeded in suffocating the Communists. He did exactly what he
                    had planned.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Allen, did you find that in dealing with the Socialists at
                        this time, the ambassador and maybe even Anderson were saying “Don't get too
                        friendly?” I mean, were we watching the Socialists? Did we really not like
                        them within our orbit or anything of that nature at this point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, not really. Certainly not on the part of Bob Anderson, who was a
                    professional. At that point I was too junior that it didn't really make any
                    difference from the point of view of any, quote, embarrassment to the US
                    Government. In my view, this is exactly at the level of political discussion and
                    enquiry that a political officer should do. As it turned out, it was
                    advantageous in getting some understanding of where the Socialist Party was
                    moving.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as we watched with Mitterrand, you went to Epinay?
                        Did we see the developments with Mitterrand moving into the presidency as
                        a... How did we view that at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I think people were concerned that in his attempt to create a working
                    majority with the left - it was called the Union of the Left - that it would be
                    Communist-dominated and that it would further loosen French ties to the Atlantic
                    Alliance and that this would cause us problems. At the time this was happening,
                    we were beginning to creep out of Vietnam, if you will recall. Nixon, of course,
                    was in office, and we were negotiating. The Paris Peace Talks were taking place,
                    and there was still a tremendous amount of agitation on the left against
                    American involvement in Vietnam. I found myself defending our policy. I felt
                    passionately that despite my own personal views on the wisdom of ever having
                    made this stake in Southeast Asia, it was abhorrent to me that the American
                    people treated the American servicemen who returned from Vietnam so badly. Here
                    these kids had been drafted and gone and served their country and served their
                    country well under enormous difficulties with enormous difficulties not only the
                    war itself but the drug culture that was then prevalent in the armed forces, and
                    I was absolutely outraged by the way our service people were treated by so many
                    sectors of the American public opinion when they came home. I felt passionately
                    about that. That made it in many respects easy for me to defend American service
                    in Vietnam. I spent a lot of time talking to groups and arguing about it. As I
                    say, the Paris Peace Talks were underway at the time, and we had at a certain
                    point - and I can't remember what year it was; I was there from 1970 to 1974 -
                    we had the opening of China at that time.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                <p>HOLMES: I'll come to that in a minute, but just to finish up on the Vietnam piece
                    - when a very well-known American general, Vernon Walters, Dick Walters, was our
                    defense attach� there at the time, as a general officer - which was unusual.
                    When he left, he was replaced by a brigadier general who had served in Vietnam.
                    At a certain point, Life Magazine came out with an edition where he was
                    literally the centerfold, on bended knee, with a rifle in the crook of his arm,
                    with the body of a Viet Cong at his feet, almost like a hunting trophy. This
                    photograph was reproduced endlessly in the French press. This was our new
                    defense attach�. This kind of stirred up a lot of activity for our USIS branch
                    and the political officers.</p>
                <p>At some point I should talk to you about the Chinese connection in Paris because
                    that was a fascinating episode.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, but before we move to the Chinese connection, I
                        would like to ask about dealing with the left. You had served before in
                        Rome, and my experience in Italy was that our opposition to the opening to
                        the left was profound. I mean it was like either you believed in the virgin
                        birth or you didn't believe in the virgin birth. Yet the Italian Communist
                        was in many ways much softer. They were sort of Italian, and like everything
                        Italian, it wasn't quite as dogmatic. But when you move over to the French
                        Communist Party, it was - I can't remember-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, it was Maurice Thorez who was one of the leaders of the French
                    Communist Party, and they were very hard-edged. They were tough.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They were both tough and they were very much considered
                        the tool of the Kremlin, in a way.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, they were very tough. They had been born, of course, in the crucible
                    of the resistance in World War II and had fought the Germans and then later us
                    for political influence. Yes, they were a very different breed, and difficult to
                    deal with, and played hardball, and played hardball in the French unions as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find the same sort of theology within the embassy
                        in Paris that you did in our embassy in Rome about opening to the left, or
                        was it different?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>HOLMES: I would say it was more sophisticated, and obviously the same
                    prohibitions existed. We were not allowed to openly have contact with the
                    Communist Party. Most of the contact with the Communist Party was done
                    indirectly. I would occasionally meet Communists, but most of my reporting was
                    through French journalists and French Socialists. I mean, that's where I got
                    most of my information about what the Communist Party was up to. I did not have
                    regular contacts with the Communist Party. I think one or two trusted members of
                    the “other Political Section,” the Agency's group, did have some very carefully
                    controlled contacts with a handful of Communists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But obviously you were reading the Communist
                        newspaper.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, sure, L'Humanit�. Yes, absolutely. They were very, very hard-edged
                    and working very hard to maintain the strength of their constituency in
                    France.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you feel at that time about the French media?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: The French media were terrific. That was a tremendous advantage for me as
                    a political officer in Paris. Of course, I knew a lot about French politics and
                    France. I already spoke fluent French, so I had an ease of access that was very
                    fortunate from my standpoint. I cultivated half a dozen wonderful French
                    journalists, sort of across the political spectrum. First of all, I learned a
                    lot from them, but also I met people through these French journalists. We were
                    frequently working the same side of the street in terms of getting information
                    and putting it together, making judgments on where-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But did you find with the media that it was very much in
                        reading it each newspaper you read came from a particular spectrum of the
                        political thing, or were there ones which encompassed more?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, it depends what you were reading. The sort of stodgy but highly
                    professional what I would call newspaper of record was Le Monde, and Le Monde
                    did not have any particular political label on it. It was just the most
                    professional foreign policy daily in France, and they prided themselves on not
                    having pictures or any glossy photographs. It was just a very straight kind of
                    reporting, and some very talented reporters for Le Monde. Humanit� was obviously
                    completely the official newspaper of the Communist Party. You had satiric
                    newspaper, like Le Canard Encha�n�, the “Duck in Chains.” It was a marvelous
                    newspaper, and there were some interesting tidbits that came out.</p>
                <pb facs="0081" n="Page0081"/>
                <p>One experience that I never had in the four years that I had as a Foreign Service
                    officer that I did see when I was there as a student is that in times of crisis
                    French newspapers are picked up by the police. There is a special statute that
                    allows them to do that when a national emergency is declared, and I can remember
                    after the 13th of May, 1958, when the colonels' Putsch had taken place in
                    Algiers and when there was this very nervous period of about a week when there
                    was this negotiation going on with De Gaulle, when the police were out in the
                    street and the army was out, and every morning the police would go out and hit
                    all the newsstands and pick up those newspapers which they felt were subversive,
                    including - I remember being amused - Le Canard Encha�n�.</p>
                <p>There was a guy named Servan-Schreiber.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, Le d�fi am�ricain, was it? The American
                        Challenge.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, yes, Le d�fi am�ricain? He had a weekly magazine. They had their sort
                    of Time and Newsweek, which were L'Express and Le Point. He, as I recall,
                    published Express. I saw him occasionally. I knew several people at Le point.
                    There was a wonderful newspaper pundit named Bernard Le Fort, who was very
                    plugged in with the senior French leadership. I learned a lot from him. I had a
                    range of people. Some of these papers tended to be a little bit more
                    conservative or a little bit to the left, but other than party rags like
                    Humanit�, they weren't slavishly devoted to a certain credo. They weren't
                    doctrinaire.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: Well, there are a lot of tabloids in England, but there are some great

                <p>HOLMES: That was my view as well. I think he did, but then again, I only had a
                    few weeks overlap with him, so I really wasn't in a position to gauge.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I always come away with the impression that there's sort
                        of a built-in disdain for Americans in the intelligentsia. Was this your
                        impression?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, sure, that absolutely is true, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did one deal with this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I mean, you just talked with people, you explained your government's
                    point of view, you exchanged ideas. I never had any problems with that.
                    Actually, one of the most difficult sort of discussion evenings I can remember
                    spending in France was not with a Frenchman; it was with Mary McCarthy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh yes, she was the Catholic authoress.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, and she was rabidly anti-Vietnam and anti-US policy and was an
                    embarrassment. I had a knock-down drag-out fight with her that went on for about
                    four hours after a dinner with a great deal of alcohol being consumed, mostly on
                    her side, where basically her thesis was that any American that served in
                    Vietnam, even if he were drafted - and they were practically all drafted; there
                    were some volunteers; the Marine Corps still had volunteers - was ipso facto by
                    association with that a war criminal. I mean, that was her thesis, and that's
                    the thesis that she expounded in France when she talked to French media. It was
                    one of the most unpleasant evenings I can remember, and I'm sure she went away
                    feeling the same way about me.</p>
                <p>But I never had any problems. There was a very enterprising labor attach� that we
                    had in our embassy named John Condon. John had a lot of contact with the French
                    intelligentsia, and he entertained in a nontraditional and much more appealing
                    way than most Foreign Service officers. He would invite people for breakfast or
                    for supper in his kitchen, and people would kind of come and go. It was kind of
                    an open house, and he became known for that, and so he had terrific contacts,
                    and I tapped into some of that. That was a lot of fun. So we had people that
                    were out there really talking to French intellectuals, French labor leaders and
                    political leaders, writers.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that there was a curiosity about the animal

                <p>HOLMES: People were trying to understand what was happening in the United States
                    because of the reaction to the war in Vietnam in the United States. This was
                    something that was analyzed and discussed and reported on in great detail by the
                    French press.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, now, Nixon was treated... I can remember friends of mine who were
                    left-of-center liberal political types and journalists more than once saying
                    that we were committing regicide the way we were going after Nixon. They were
                    appalled. They liked Nixon.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Nixon and Kissinger were the most European of-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, they understood. They felt that these were two American political
                    leaders who understood Europe and understood France - and wanted to understand
                    more about their country. They were flattered about the attention of people like
                    Nixon and Kissinger. It was very interesting. They were appalled by Watergate,
                    and they thought it was a huge exaggeration on our part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned the Chinese connection.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I failed to mention something. I started out my first year in Paris of a
                    four year assignment as head of a small internal political unit. At a certain
                    point about the end of that first year, the DCM came to me and said that the
                    ambassador wanted me to be his special assistant. I just absolutely did not want
                    to do that. I had been a special assistant and I thought that I had moved in my
                    career beyond that. I was strongly opposed to it. I tried to get out of it, and
                    I basically was told that I had no choice, that it was a done deal, but that I
                    would be rewarded. I said, “What do you mean 'rewarded?'" and he said, “Well,
                    after you do this for a while, when Anderson leaves, he wants to make you
                    political counselor.” I said, “Well, that'll never happen. I'm not senior
                    enough, and it's a big section, and Washington will never permit it.” I was
                    really opposed to this, but anyway, I was just told to shut up and grit my teeth
                    and do my job, and this was good for the Foreign Service. So I did that for
                    about six to eight months, I guess. I was his special assistant, and we worked a
                    lot on drugs, you know, bringing down the French connection in Marseilles. Then
                    eventually, to my surprise, when Anderson was leaving, he did put my name
                    forward to be the political counselor, and there was a reaction in Personnel in
                    Washington. They didn't want me to do this. They said I was too junior and so
                    forth. Watson insisted, and so finally they agreed. So I became political
                    counselor, which then opened up a whole different range of international
                    responsibilities and activities operating out of the political section of that
                    embassy. The Chinese connection was the big one.</p>
                <pb facs="0084" n="Page0084"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: This was absolutely fascinating because what happened was that when Nixon
                    came out of China, after the Shanghai communiqu� was published, everyone knew
                    that there would be a long period before we would be able to effect the opening
                    of liaison offices (they weren't called embassies) in Beijing and in Washington.
                    In the interim, Paris was established as the official point of contact between
                    our two governments. The Chinese selected Paris. Why? Because, Huan Chen, the
                    Chinese ambassador there, was the senior Chinese diplomat serving abroad at that
                    point. He was a member of the Central Committee; he was a veteran of the Long
                    March; he was a trusted colleague of Mao and Zhou En-Lai. It was a very big
                    embassy, very disciplined, with a few special characters. Anyway, when this was
                    announced, our ambassador, Watson, was called back to Washington to receive
                    special instructions from the President and primarily from Kissinger, who was
                    still the national security advisor at that point. Al Haig was a colonel working
                    on Kissinger's staff. He got all these special instructions on how to handle the
                    channel, and there would be no freebooting, that this was to be tightly
                    administered, that he would receive instructions from the White House, not from
                    the State Department, et cetera et cetera. Watson returned from that trip and
                    called on Huan Chen and took me along. I was by that time political counselor,
                    and he took me to see Huan Chen. Huan Chen had with him a man named Tsao, and
                    after some initial pleasantries and some tea, Huan Chen told Watson, he said,
                    “You and I will not meet very often, but for secondary matters I will appoint
                    Mr. Tsao to handle the Chinese side.” Watson said, “Well, for secondary matters,
                    I appoint Mr. Holmes.” So then that established a relationship that ended up - I
                    must have gone to the Chinese embassy 40 times or so for many, many meetings on
                    a variety of subjects. By the way, we worked through a Chinese interpreter until
                    I was able to get Washington to assign a Chinese language officer into our
                    political section. I spent a lot of time with Mr. Tsao, who was a very
                    interesting individual. He was the hand-picked personal representative of Zhou
                    En-Lai in that embassy. Zhou En-Lai, of course, had a big stake in the American
                    relationship, and very frequently criticized inside the Chinese politburo.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. This was the “Gang of Four” time. This was a very
                        difficult time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0085" n="Page0085"/>
                <p>HOLMES: It was a high-risk venture for Zhou En-Lai. So Mr. Tsao was his personal
                    rep. Tsao could be described as a blend of political counselor, station chief,
                    and USIS officer. Those are sort of the press, the politics - that was his area.
                    He was the only member of the Chinese embassy who seemed to be allowed to travel
                    by himself, who wore a European suit. He always wore the same tie. I finally
                    felt like buying him and bringing him a selection because I got tired of seeing
                    the same necktie. But we had a file on this guy. He came from a Shanghai
                    bourgeois family. There was an American college in Shanghai before World War II
                    and he had spent a couple of years there, so I knew he understood English, and I
                    knew he also spoke French, because he had served in Southeast Asia, in Cambodia.
                    But until we got to know each other, he always insisted on working through Mr.
                    Lin, his interpreter. We both had very tight instructions. My instructions were
                    actually written by Haig and sent, not through the Department but through
                    special White House channels, and I was told always to go back through that
                    channel and not to discuss anything but what I was told to discuss. It was very,
                    very controlled.</p>
                <p>But the interesting thing was that whenever I went to see Tsao we wouldn't get
                    down to business. There was always tea and a period of munching on dried lichee
                    nuts and candied apples. It was during that period, which was kind of informal,
                    that Tsao, after a certain time, was absolutely badgering me with questions
                    about what was happening to Nixon - obviously, Zhou En-Lai was very concerned -
                    and whether Nixon would survive or not, and if he didn't, as it became apparent
                    more and more that he might not, did that mean that we would all be fired, the
                    entire administration, people like me? Would the embassy be fired? Would there
                    be a wholesale roundup of all the accomplices of Richard Nixon? So, you know,
                    even though I didn't have my little instructions from Al Haig, I spent a lot of
                    time giving him basically Political Science 101 on the American government and
                    our system and how it operated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would think it would be very difficult, really, to give
                        good comment on the Watergate system because most of us abroad - I was
                        consul general in Athens during this time - I mean, we were at some remove.
                        We weren't feeling how the heat was-</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>HOLMES: And so was I, and I was very careful not to speculate on what might
                    happen to Nixon, but there were always a series of hypothetical outcomes. What I
                    could explain to him were the impeachment process, how it worked, if it were to
                    happen what would ensue, and our presidential succession system - the Vice
                    President - the administration, how people were appointed. I gave him a lot of
                    sort of fundamental information about our Constitution and the workings of our
                    government, which I think was probably enormously relieving. I never speculated
                    on, if such a thing were to happen to Nixon, what would this do to our policy to
                    China. I never speculated on that. I never speculated explicitly, but there were
                    plenty of opportunities for him to draw inferences from what I was saying, that
                    although, yes, the opening to China had been done by the President on his visit
                    to Beijing and, of course, Kissinger's role in this, but that this had become a
                    part of American foreign policy. I didn't say that if Nixon goes and another man
                    comes in the policy will remain intact, as sort of frozen in time, but the
                    implication was that there was a commitment here to an opening to China that was
                    broader than just the President operating out of the National Security Council.
                    Anyway, it was a very, very interesting period. Of course, I did report all of
                    that, what this guy was saying to me. It was important that Washington
                    understand that.</p>
                <p>We had a couple of amusing incidents. When Nixon went to China, the Chinese gave
                    two panda bears, which ended up in the Washington Zoo, and we gave a couple of
                    musk oxen. The musk oxen, at a certain point, got sick and had this terrible
                    scrofula. So here was this very secret channel of communications, and I was
                    sending back a message encrypted about going to the Washington Zoo and finding
                    out how they could treat the musk oxen. You know, this is really high policy.
                    Then other things would happen, like one time we bombed Hanoi harbor and hit a
                    Chinese ammunition ship. And Mr. Tsao made a visit to the embassy with a very
                    grave face - there was a certain amount of theater involved because basically
                    they wanted to get on with business; he had to carry out this d�marche - and I
                    told him solemnly the point of view of my government, and he said, “Okay, can we
                    have some coffee?” And it was over. It was business as usual.</p>
                <pb facs="0087" n="Page0087"/>
                <p>At a certain point I invited him. We'd had no contact with the Chinese. After I'd
                    had quite a few meetings with him, I invited him to dinner at my house. I guess
                    the occasion was that his wife had arrived. She'd not been at post. So I invited
                    him and his assistant, Mr. Tsai, and his wife, who was the acupuncturist at the
                    embassy, and Mr. Lin, the interpreter. They all came to dinner. At this point we
                    were bombing Hanoi, and we'd hit this ship. By that time we had a Chinese
                    language officer, so that helped, and my wife was very concerned that they were
                    going to stage a walkout. Oh, and her parents were there. That was what was
                    interesting. Her parents were retired in Nice and had come up. He was a retired
                    AID officer, and her mother was French, and so everyone was very fluent in
                    French. At a certain point in this dinner, Tsao discovered that he had served in
                    Phnom Penh shortly after my father-in-law had, and at a time when our
                    relationship was very bad, and a road that my father-in-law had started as an
                    AID project Mr. Tsao had continued as a Chinese project. This was an amazing
                    coming together. They got along together like a house on fire, so much so that
                    at a certain point toward the end of the dinner, Tsao got up and - he had been
                    talking in French by this time, got beyond that point - but at a certain point
                    he stood up and had something to say, and he said it in Chinese. I waited
                    nervously for the interpretation to be something about bombing, but no, he
                    wanted to insist - he knew that my parents-in-law were going back to Nice in a
                    couple of days, but he absolutely wanted to have them for dinner, and this was
                    very important to him that he had discovered this wonderful person, and he just
                    had to do this. So I inferred from all of this that the respect for elders was
                    not something that had got completely washed out of the Communist experiment in
                    China. We had a wonderful dinner afterwards. We went to a Chinese restaurant in
                    Paris, and of course there were hundreds of them. This one was clearly in the
                    hands of the Chinese Communists because when you walk in, nothing about ancient
                    China but here was a tapestry of a dam being built, obviously in the '50s. We
                    had a wonderful, wonderful evening, and the ice was broken. We had developed a
                    relationship with him that went a little bit beyond the more formal part of our
                    dealings with each other.</p>
                <p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: -his children thought there was a breed of people called
                        “Thosegoddamfrench” out there because every time he'd come home he'd talk
                        about “those God-damned French.” You must have been sort of on the point of
                        contact where the French were always taking a stand different from the
                        United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, not always. I think that this attitude toward the French is greatly
                    exaggerated, and it's almost in inverse proportion to the truth of it. The less
                    the diplomat who talks about the “God-damned French” knows about France and
                    French policy, the more he's likely to say this sort of thing, because it's
                    true, the French always have a point of view, very clearly articulated, you have
                    to listen very carefully. I discovered early on when I would go to the Quai
                    d'Orsay to carry out d�marches on a variety of subjects that it was very
                    important to know... If there were twelve points to know about the subject, you
                    might feel pretty good about knowing eleven of them, but if you didn't know all
                    twelve, with absolute certainty the Frenchman would know the twelfth. You had to
                    be intellectually equipped, and in terms of information, you had to have full
                    information about the subject in order to be able to have a conversation. Once
                    you got beyond that initial barrier, you could work things out with the French.
                    I got to the point with the director of North American affairs, who was a senior
                    French diplomat who'd been ambassador. His name was Saint-L�ger - I remember
                    him. I proposed that we meet once a week, and we did. We would meet every week.
                    On one occasion, after we got to know each other, he said, “Let's take a walk” -
                    because it was a delicate subject we were discussing, one where French interests
                    were seen as diametrically different from ours. We went out, and we walked in
                    the park. When we got out in the park he explained to me. He said, “I asked you
                    to come out and walk with me in the park because I've discovered that my offices
                    are bugged and that the Gaullists are so catatonic about what I might say about
                    what I might say to an American colleague, or anybody who comes to my office,
                    that they're listening to my conversations with fellow diplomats. So from now
                    on, I think we should walk in the park so that we can have a real conversation
                    and I'm not nervous.” I thought this was absolutely extraordinary, but the point
                    is: the French bring a lot. Yes, they can be difficult as hell, but they also
                    bring a certain intellectual rigor to a conversation, and there's a certain
                    logic. Sometimes they call it Cartesian logic; sometimes it's not. But if you
                    listen very carefully, if you take the trouble to understand their point of view
                    as well as understanding your own government's views and objectives, you can
                    make progress on subjects. I never had a big problem with this. And then there
                    are certain things that are just insoluble - you know, this is our view, and
                    that's your view, and I'll report it that way to Washington, and we'll see if at
                    the next senior meeting maybe we can make some progress on that. But I never had
                    trouble with this aspect of dealing with the French.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we feel at this time about the French and the rest
                        of the world and the United States and the rest of the world? Were we in
                        basic agreement? Let's take the Middle East.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Look, the French never really accepted the dissolution of the French
                    empire at the end of World War II because they always felt that they were a
                    major power and that even though they no longer had Indochina and Algeria and
                    other parts of the world, that because of their... The French always had a
                    cultural policy. They had a responsibility to defend the French language, French
                    cultural institutions, and that this gave them a certain entr�e around the
                    world, and they used it. They were basically working very hard to maintain
                    influence. They were absolutely unwilling to accept a sort of second-class
                    status. One of the reasons for this was they were always afraid of Germany, and
                    they were working very hard to develop this comity with the German nation and
                    the twinning of the cities and kids, students, going back and forth and spending
                    time in each other's lyc�es and gymnasiums and university exchanges, but at the
                    same time they were working very hard to become an economic power and not have
                    to always be the caboose of the European monetary system with the central bank
                    of Germany being the engine. One way to counteract that financial and economic
                    prowess of Germany was for them to be able to maintain a certain status as a
                    power in the world. They were absolutely determined to do it. So this did lead
                    to some conflict. They exaggerated, for example, and they continue to exaggerate
                    to this day, I think, their influence in the Middle East. They had a kind of
                    traditional role in Lebanon and Syria. There was a certain French influence
                    going back to the early part of the century, French lyc�es. Even today in
                    Lebanon there are Lebanese Maronites whose Christian names are French. We always
                    felt that we were the one country that could talk to both sides, to both Israel
                    and the Arab countries, and we were not very inviting, to say the least, to
                    French attempts to exert influence in the Middle East. Today there is a
                    commission that takes place to tamp down the violence that takes place between
                    southern Lebanon and northern Israel and the intervening security zone, the
                    Katusha attacks. There is a group that's French, American, Israeli, and I
                    believe Lebanese that meets every two or three weeks. So they have been able to
                    salvage some sort of position, so I think that that desire on the part of the
                    French Government - and it's bipartisan, across the board, something that they
                    want to do - that still exists today; and it is the reason why sometimes we have
                    difficulty.</p>

                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>HOLMES: After the Fifth Republic was set up and the institutions of the Fifth
                    Republic and this hybrid system - you had a president who had executive
                    responsibility and a prime minister - the French presidency, as started by De
                    Gaulle and maintained by subsequent presidents of France, had what they call a
                    domaine r�serv�, their special office that dealt with Africa. So there was an
                    office in the Elys�e where African leaders - prime ministers and presidents -
                    could turn and have direct access to the president of France. They took this
                    very seriously, always have. My own point of view is that we have not worked
                    with that in a creative way. We had tended to feel that we're in competition
                    somehow with the French in Africa. Different administrations, different
                    secretaries, different assistant secretaries for African affairs have used this
                    relationship in varying ways.</p>
                <p>I'll give you an example of a current problem, and that's peacekeeping and the
                    turmoil that's taking place in Africa today. The French have had, up until
                    recently, when they've begun to cut back as well, they've had much more of an
                    establishment - French economic aid, French military - throughout the
                    French-speaking part of Africa, basically a zone of influence, something that is
                    good for all of us. It's good for the west; it's good for our relationship. We
                    haven't used this sufficiently; we haven't recognized it. We kind of turn to the
                    French at the last minute and say, oh, yes, would you mind joining us, rather
                    than treating them as full-fledged partners from the beginning. An example of
                    this was the African Crisis Response Initiative, where a couple of years ago the
                    State Department, led by a guy named Marshall McCallie, started a project to
                    train cadres or battalions of Africans to do peacekeeping. One of the early
                    success stories was the Senegalese battalion. Well, eventually, the French
                    joined us in this, but we bumbled our way along and tried to do it unilaterally,
                    and then we brought the British in, and finally, the French were opposing us
                    because they weren't being invited in. We finally realized that we're missing
                    something here. This is a typical example of us not listening to and
                    understanding the realities on the ground. The French bring a lot to the table
                    in Africa. They have a lot of influence; they put a lot in there. It's an
                    example, I would say, of how to deal with the French intelligently...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to this '70-74 period, you mention at the Quai
                        d'Orsay that the Gaullists were sort of sitting there listening. Who were
                        the Gaullists? Did we have the feeling at that time that there was a
                        Gaullist cadre within the French Government with whom we were dealing that
                        was essentially, this early, anti-American, or not?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, I think that's safe to say, not all of them viscerally
                    anti-American, but I would say viscerally pro-memory-of-De-Gaulle. I would put
                    it more that way. Yes, there were cadres of people who were absolutely Gaullist,
                    and people knew who they were, and other Frenchmen were wary of them because
                    they felt that it was some sort of a priesthood that and it prevented them from
                    letting French policy evolve, seeking opportunities to do things in different
                    ways that were in the French national interest and so forth and so forth. So
                    yes, they were there.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: Oh, we were dealing with them. We knew who they were. I mean, there were

                    point of view heard, but we didn't limit ourselves to those people. We talked to

                    Pompidou was president. In fact, I think that shortly after I arrived in Paris,
                    in 1970, De Gaulle died, as I recall, and then Georges Pompidou came in. I'm
                    trying to remember when Giscard d'Estaing was president. He was president before
                    that - or just after. After, I guess.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: De Gaulle resigned in '69, and then he died in 1970. Pompidou succeeded
                    him. Then, I guess, after that it was Giscard d'Estaing and then Mitterrand.
                    Anyway, it was Pompidou.</p>

                        Gaulle or were we seeing a difference in dealing with him?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, we were seeing a different man, a man who was much more of the sort
                    of crony politician and very skillful maneuverer, somebody who had a very
                    different kind of experience in World War II, that was frequently pointed out by
                    his detractors, that he had been a high-school teacher and had written sort of
                    critical editions of French classics during the war. His detractors would make a
                    lot of that. Ambassador Watson developed a special relationship with him.
                    Presidents of France, just because we lived practically next door to the Elys�e,
                    didn't mean that... Presidents of France did not go to ambassadors' houses for
                    dinner. Watson kept working on this, and finally he said, “Look, suppose I
                    invite you to come over for dinner as your neighbor, not as the ambassador of
                    the United States? Would you accept?” He did. He came for dinner, and it was a
                    very interesting evening with him.</p>

                        one-dimensional - the French connection - but obviously there was more to
                        it. How would you say he evolved as an ambassador?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, he met a lot of people, and he did have a good command of French,
                    and when necessary he would go and talk to the foreign minister about this
                    subject or that subject. He didn't really evolve that much. He was very active
                    in the business field. He knew a lot of French business people. IBM was one of
                    the first big American corporations after World War II, when it was developing
                    its overseas operations, not only to hire but to prepare for senior leadership
                    local business people. I remember Jacques Maisonrouge. It was kind of unheard of
                    that he was elected early on to the board of directors of IBM. I think he was
                    the only non-American when he was elected, and that was considered an unusual
                    move. Watson had a lot to do with that, so he had easy entr�e into the French
                    business community and met with them a lot. That was an advantage, too.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, there was a certain amount of that, certainly. I think there was a
                    concern that American business, through their overseas operations incorporated
                    within France - they were watched very carefully... The French wanted to develop
                    their own industrial and commercial prowess. I mean they didn't want to be
                    dominated by American companies. They worked very hard at that. Kind of - if you
                    will - emblematic of that desire to have their own strategic sense, both in the
                    military and the economic sense, was De Gaulle's decision to develop nuclear
                    power in a big way, to develop nuclear weapons. They went their own way, they
                    did it on their own, although it has come out - I think I can say this now -
                    that there was some American help, mostly on safety, but this was a very deep
                    secret for a long time, but it was going on during that period, as early as the
                    late '60s, early '70s. But this was a decision that De Gaulle made for France,
                    that France should have its own sweep of nuclear weapons. They called it the
                    force de dissuasion, the force de frappe. The offshoot of that was that France
                    also made a decision to develop in a major way nuclear power for their national
                    energy grid, and today, if I'm not mistaken, as a percentage of power generated
                    by nuclear energy, I think France is the second country in the world. I think
                    the first is Lithuania. Something like 85 percent. France has just slightly more
                    than 80 percent of their national power generated by nuclear power plants. So
                    this was a major commitment of French resources and, of course, a long-term
                    commitment to go that way. It was De Gaulle who set them on that track, and
                    succeeding French governments pursued that. French technology developed
                    tremendously during the '60s, '70s, and '80s. We've all had this experience
                    traveling in France - just taking computers, for example. Today it's
                    commonplace. If you go downtown to Union Station to take a train to New York,
                    you make your reservation with your credit card and you go and you tap into the
                    system and put your reservation number in and your credit card and out come the
                    tickets. Well, France had that years ago, long before we did, and of course
                    their successful experiment in high-powered fast trains and their transportation
                    system. They've done a lot to develop their own high technology, and they've
                    tried initially to do it in a way that was independent. Of course, that was
                    impossible, and eventually, like all of us... You have multinational
                    corporations that are the only corporations that have the resources to be able
                    to develop the financing and the technology to do a lot of these very expensive
                    projects. But this was a deliberate French policy started by De Gaulle. If it
                    hadn't been for somebody like Charles de Gaulle and his will power to do it,
                    probably it couldn't have been done.</p>

                        is. Just one last question before we move off France. Did you get involved
                        in the movie wars - I mean Hollywood versus the French films and all
                        that?</hi>

                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>HOLMES: No, I didn't, but you're speaking about culture. I'll recount one little
                    incident, talking about French pride. My wife and I were friends with a New York
                    lawyer named Lee Eastman (he's now dead), whose law practice was focused on
                    artists and actors and musicians. He had, in the early days, the American
                    abstract expressionists, beginning with Jackson Pollock and that whole school.
                    He helped them, and they frequently couldn't pay their legal fees, so they gave
                    him paintings and drawings. He ended up with the most extraordinary - now worth
                    hundreds of millions of dollars - collection of American abstract expressionist
                    art in private hands. He wanted to establish somewhere in Paris - because he was
                    struck by the fact when he would visit Paris that it was very nationalistic. You
                    go to the Orangerie and see French expressionists and once in a while they'd
                    have a show of some American paintings, but he felt that there ought to be a
                    room, at least, or one gallery in one of the big museums in France that was
                    dedicated to American art, so he offered to gather together a collection, mostly
                    from his own collection, and sort of send it on permanent loan - sort of 99-year
                    loan - if we could negotiate with a French museum to do this. Well, we tried -
                    my wife and I did - and we struck out big-time with the national museums. Then
                    we went to the Municipal Museum of Paris, and there's a very good painting
                    museum there. We made a lot of headway with underlings, but when we got up to
                    the director, it turned out he was a card-carrying member of the Communist
                    Party, and he hated Americans and there was no way that he was going to allow
                    this cultural infiltration from a fly-by-night school. Oh, yes, Jackson Pollock
                    and company, they were pretty good painters, but he wasn't going to allow them.
                    “Once in a while we show one of those paintings.” We said, “This is not going to
                    cost you anything. It will be a 99-year permanent lease.” No, it never happened.

                    place like Paris is called upon to do. I was assigned the responsibility at a
                    certain point to maintain contact with Papandreou, who had been president of
                    Greece.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Andreas Papandreou. Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: George Papandreou was his father.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, today the defense minister of Greece is a Papandreou, and he's
                    either the nephew or the son. I think I'm talking about George.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, George was dead, I think by this time. This had to be

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I guess it was Andreas. But he was in exile there, and we wanted to stay
                    in touch with him very quietly, so that was one of my jobs. I was just told, go
                    and find him and be in touch with him. So I would go to his hotel, and we'd have
                    tea and we'd talk. I probably did that half a dozen times. But it was just a
                    little vignette of the way a good assistant secretary of European affairs, sort
                    of thinking ahead to the future, was taking advantage of a rather well-staffed
                    embassy in Paris to sort of keep a relationship going there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One question. Here you are dealing with political affairs
                        in France, and obviously it's a complicated subject. It covers a whole
                        spectrum. We have a large, I assume, intelligence agency there, talking
                        about the CIA and all that. Was there much cooperation, swapping of
                        information, or was it a one-way street. In that particular aspect, how
                        useful was it for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Actually, for me personally it was very useful. Others had difficulty,
                    but first of all, the defense attach�, General Dick Walters, was a very, very
                    old friend who actually had known my father in World War II when he was a young
                    lieutenant, and he and I had served together in Italy, and so we had a close
                    personal friendship, and that made a big difference, although, as garrulous a
                    man as Dick Walters was, I never knew that the Kissinger trip to Pakistan and
                    Indochina to set up the Nixon opening to China had all been negotiated by Dick
                    Walters with the Chinese embassy in Paris. That's how close... I learned that he
                    had done that in about my third meeting with Mr. Tsao, when I said, “I really
                    like these candied apples.” He said, “So does General Walters.” Bingo. The light
                    went on. I went back to the embassy and said, “Dick, you've been holding out on
                    me.” He said, “You didn't have a need to know.” But actually I had good
                    relations with him. We worked very closely. The station chief and I had a good
                    relationship, primarily because I discovered the CIA officer that was working
                    the Socialist Party was a very intelligent, engaging individual, and we became
                    very good friends, and so we got a lot of cooperation. But institutionally, it
                    didn't always work that way. It was a very difficult relationship.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And in a way it's, you know, both people are working on
                        the same subject, and yet the reports go in and do they come back? Are they
                        useful? And the answer often is-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Institutionally, I got to see what they allowed me to see, because
                    typically the way they operated in those days was to gather the political
                    reporting and they would write it up in ways similar to the way we did, in full
                    paragraphs and organized and as well-written as they could make it, and get it
                    off; but then at Langley it would be edited and sent back to the field as an
                    official report. That's the way it worked. But the raw reporting you would never
                    see - I never saw. But coming back, occasionally, there would be certain things
                    that were centered on France that a couple of us were allowed to see. It was
                    pretty tight.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: A necessary and marvelous sabbatical. Every professional should have a
                    sabbatical. The academic community is more structured about it, but I though it
                    was very important, particularly the way we did it in the 17th seminar, which, I
                    gather, was the last time that we had the luxury to do some of the things that
                    we did, but for many of us who had served years abroad and had missed the not so
                    much revolutionary activity but the accelerated evolution in so many fields of
                    life in American society, it was a great reintroduction to our own country, and
                    I thought it was extraordinarily valuable. Touring the inner city of a large
                    American city beset with crime and drugs, going around with the police; studying
                    the Puerto Rican phenomenon both in the South Bronx, where people were dealing
                    with super-rats, going and visiting Puerto Rico itself; seeing what was
                    happening at the military basic training facilities - as, of course, we had four
                    officers from the armed services in our group - and on and on and on. Mr. Fuller
                    - was that the name? - the architect of the geodesic dome-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, Buckminster Fuller.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, I said it right, Buckminster Fuller. There were just so many
                    different aspects, social, political, economic, cultural, scientific, things
                    that had been happening in the United States - it was a great reintroduction and
                    equipped us all, I think, well to have an updated understanding of our own
                    country so we could represent our country's interests abroad in our future
                    assignments. Personally, I chose as my independent project, the six-week
                    project... I think I was one of the few if not the sole member of the class that
                    did not pick a foreign or defense policy issue. I picked ethics in journalism
                    and had a wonderful time traveling around the United States visiting news
                    councils, ombudsmen, radio stations, both chain- and independently owned
                    newspapers and news organizations to look at the whole phenomenon of
                    responsibility in the press. I had a lot of fun doing that and writing my
                    findings up in paper. I was just finishing that when I was yanked out of the
                    seminar to go and take over the NATO office in the State Department.</p>

                        we tend to think everything comes out of Washington. And looking at Detroit

                <p>HOLMES: '75, yes. I believe it was May, 1975, to go and be the director of RPM,
                    the Regional Political-Military Office in the European Bureau, largely acting as
                    the backstopping office for our mission to the North Atlantic Treaty

                <p>HOLMES: I did it from '75 to '77, just about two years.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I remember one of my early tasks was to help prepare the way for
                    first of all a Ford NATO summit. Every new president at some point or other
                    likes to have a sort of laying-on of hands, putting his signature as the leader
                    of the North Atlantic Alliance. The other thing was the baptism of the CSCE, the
                    treaty that launched the cooperative security in Europe, that organization.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the attitude that you were getting and sort of
                        within your sphere of operations towards this CSCE when it was just in its
                        initial phases. Ford was President; Henry Kissinger was Secretary of State.

                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, looking back on it, I don't have any very well-formed opinions on
                    what I thought about it at the time, since I was down in the trenches doing my
                    job, but looking back on it from today's vantage point and seeing what has
                    happened with the expansion of NATO, it was in some respects a forerunner of the
                    expansion of the North Atlantic Alliance. We, in my humble view, should have
                    worked harder at making this the all-inclusive organization which it has become
                    in a somewhat inchoate, clumsy way - an organization which I think I have
                    encountered recently with the new states spinning off of Yugoslavia. But at one
                    point it was 34 or 35 very quickly, and of course that kind of dimension was an
                    unwieldy organization but did give all European countries (and, of course, the
                    United States and Canada, as the two North American members) a chance to discuss
                    common security and cooperation issues beyond the confines of NATO. I think that
                    if we had worked harder at developing the security dimension of that
                    relationship and organization, we might not have had to move as precipitously as
                    we later did after the collapse of the Soviet Union in the early '90s to bring
                    central European countries into the North Atlantic Alliance, which I fear is
                    already leading to a dilution of focus and making it increasingly difficult -
                    and it will continue to expand, of course; I mean already Slovenia and Romania
                    are knocking at the door - to operate given the sacrosanct rule of consensus. So
                    I think that it was an important effort, the CSCE. It had to be done. I just
                    wish, looking back, that we had worked harder at forming it as a companion
                    organization, if you will, an organization that in the large European sense
                    complemented the work of NATO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm just wondering whether there was any feeling that you
                        were getting maybe on the military side or something, that this whole treaty
                        thing was sort of a sideshow and that it might sort of just get in the way
                        of what we were trying to do. I'm talking at the time.</hi>

                        that this was not going to be very important. Henry Kissinger obviously

                        looking at it from the military side, which is where you were, were thinking
                        about this as being maybe more of a problem than it was worth, or something
                        like that.</hi>

                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well those kinds of attitudes existed in the Defense Department and on
                    the, quote, third floor of our delegation headquarters. The third floor was the
                    way that the State Department people referred to the Defense Department
                    component, the OSD component, of the mission in Brussels. And yes, one
                    encountered that attitude, not so much in the State Department. We in RPM were
                    primarily concerned with the diplomacy, with more of the sort of political
                    cooperation of the Alliance than the actual military work that was done that was
                    led at Mons by SACEUR and the military structure, both the Supreme Allied
                    Headquarters in Mons and actually the military committee of NATO. Those bodies
                    tended to be dominated by the OSD representatives, and of course we were aware
                    of them and coordinated on policy issues, but we were primarily concerned with
                    the diplomacy and the politics of the Alliance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at sort of from your perspective again, the '75-77
                        period, how did we view the role of France at this particular time? This had
                        been your specialty and all, and here you were. It was not in NATO but it
                        was and it wasn't.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, France never ceased to be a member of the North Atlantic Council.
                    Obviously, the political overseeing body of the Alliance - France was always a
                    member, and an active member, sometimes in what was perceived as a negative way
                    because it was France looking after French interests, but they were, of course,
                    no longer in the integrated military structure of NATO. De Gaulle's decision to
                    withdraw France from NATO had as its objective to remove French military forces
                    and the French General Staff from the integrated part of the Alliance, so they
                    were clearly outside that, although there was growing cooperation between French
                    units, for example, in Germany, headquartered in Strasbourg. There remained at
                    least one French division, if I recall correctly, in the French occupying Zone
                    of Germany, and at the time, France was beginning to deploy, building, and I
                    can't remember exactly when France deployed its first tactical nuclear weapons,
                    but it did so at about that time or shortly thereafter, and there was a great
                    deal of discussion, of course, with German authorities as to whether those units
                    could be actually stationed with French units inside the Federal Republic or
                    whether the weapons had to remain in Strasbourg. There was a great deal of
                    discussion about that. France was pursuing its independent force de frappe,
                    their nuclear power, their strategic weapons, tactical weapons. They were
                    building of course French nuclear-powered submarines, and they were always very
                    careful to understand what Alliance military strategy was all about, so they
                    could at least be aware of the boundaries of activity while setting up their own
                    strategic planning. I recall from the political side that not infrequently the
                    French permanent representative was a kind of a pain in the neck for the other
                    members of the Alliance because frequently in making the point that France had
                    its own foreign policy and that it was a full-fledged member of the Alliance but
                    it also had a view, one had the impression from time to time that they were
                    simply firing for effect, to make the point that France was a large power and it
                    wasn't going to just rubber-stamp political decisions in the North Atlantic
                    Council with which they were uncomfortable or for which they felt that they had
                    not sufficiently prepared the ground with French public opinion. So frequently
                    they engendered some difficult and in some respects unnecessary debate in the
                    council.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain, again, at the time... You talk about
                        political decisions and the French being involved, but to the outsider NATO
                        is... You've got so many divisions, and the whole idea of NATO is if the
                        Soviets attack, NATO will counterattack. What are political decisions, and
                        what sort of things are they dealing with at this particular time, beyond
                        just, you know, to use the Third Division there or somewhere else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, of course, there's a great deal of training. There was whole
                    process of pledging units at various levels of immediacy in terms of recall and
                    assignment by member states, and that happened every year. I think it was called
                    the Defense Planning Questionnaire. It was put out every year, and every year
                    every country pledged certain units and certain capabilities to the common weal
                    of the Alliance. There was a certain amount of group therapy that accompanied
                    this activity because each country's contribution to the military strength of
                    the Alliance was then reviewed by everybody else. Certain countries had
                    perennial shortfalls. France was not subjected to that process. I think the
                    politics of that military process occupied a lot of time of the North Atlantic
                    Council. It undergirded not only what would be available in terms of military
                    response should any member country ever be attacked or threatened, which would
                    then in turn bring into play Article 5, which is what I call the D'Artagnan
                    principle, “one for all and all for one.” So that was a significant
                    political-military activity, a policy activity that went on every year, and it
                    also, depending on the kinds of units and capabilities that were made available,
                    either enhanced or diminished the purpose and the utility of the many military
                    exercises - bilateral, trilateral, and larger formations - that took place
                    throughout the year. That was just part of the whole training and preparedness
                    cycle, which, by the way, was probably never as good as it was when General
                    Alexander Haig became the supreme allied commander. He really pulled that whole
                    training system together in a dramatic and purposeful way that had never really
                    been done before. I'm getting ahead of myself because he didn't... I'm trying to
                    remember exactly when he was... No, he must have been SACEUR in the late
                    '70s.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, so I'm not too much ahead of myself here.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's an interesting comment, because so often Haig is
                        portrayed as sort of a political general and all this.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0102" n="Page0102"/>
                <p>HOLMES: That's correct, and I think he was one of the most imaginative military
                    leaders of the Alliance that we have had in the mid-life of the Alliance. He
                    invented something called the Autumn Forge Crested and Cap series of exercises,
                    which brought units of the United States armed forces that were stationed in the
                    United States that had been pledged to come to the support of NATO in time of
                    crises, and they, on an annual basis, would fly over and participate in very
                    large air-land-sea combined exercises of the Alliance. Haig ensured that all
                    these sometimes disparate collection of unilateral, bilateral, trilateral
                    exercises that various Alliance members were conducting - that all these were
                    pulled together under the umbrella of an overall training concept for the
                    Alliance, and that they reinforced each other and were conceptually designed to
                    seek the same kind of improved Alliance defense capability. It sounds easy, but
                    it wasn't. It sounds very obvious. I mean, one would ask, why wasn't this done
                    before? Well, it wasn't. It just hadn't been done before, and Haig spent a lot
                    of time making the rounds of NATO capitals talking to defense ministers, foreign
                    ministers, prime ministers, presidents, chiefs of general staffs - he saw
                    everybody in the Alliance to push this concept and to pull the defense
                    establishments - with political backing of course - of member countries into a
                    much more cohesive fighting force than it had ever been before. I think he did
                    an absolutely superb job in that respect, and he became so well known and had
                    such easy entr�e in the chancelleries of Europe that later, when he became
                    Secretary of State, it's not surprising that his most effective performance in
                    many respects as Secretary of State was with the European allies, because they
                    all knew him and trusted him. And so it just made it easy for him, in
                    effect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We've talked about the French role. Again from your
                        perspective, how did Germany fit into this thing at this time? How
                        cooperative were they? How important were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, Germany was certainly very cooperative. At that time, in the sort
                    of mid- to late '70s, Germany was a fully participating member of the Alliance
                    by that time, and felt that it had a tremendous stake. Of course it had it's own
                    continuing problems with East Germany, but you recall that in fact they
                    exercised some considerable leadership in the strategic arms arena, when Helmut
                    Schmidt, who was the one who originally proposed the deployment of the
                    intermediate nuclear force, which led to a rather extraordinary deployment in
                    five NATO countries of nuclear-armed Cruise missiles and Pershings. The
                    Pershings were, of course, only in Germany, which got the Soviets' attention in
                    a big way. Particularly, what really got their attention were the Pershings,
                    Pershing IIs I think they were - the second generation that had a particularly
                    greatly improved guidance system that would have produced pinpoint accuracy. The
                    Soviets knew a lot about that weapons system, and it got their attention. We
                    would never have been able, in my view, to have negotiated in such a successful
                    manner the Intermediate Nuclear Force Arms Control Treaty had it not been for
                    this very robust deployment of weaponry, the most important being in Germany.
                    That demonstrated Alliance cohesion and will power. The way we deployed those
                    weapons and trained with them and set up our special ammunition sites right
                    there where the weapons were, and depending on what was going on in Europe at
                    the time, some of these weapons would always be armed and on alert. So this was
                    a very robust force; it was handled intelligently and with purpose, and there is
                    no way that the Soviets could have considered this a bluff because we didn't
                    talk about it; we actually deployed the force. We spent a lot of money building
                    those weapons and deploying them and training with them and keeping them ready,
                    but it had the desired effect in terms of leading into the INF Treaty
                    negotiations later on. The German Government with us took a major leadership
                    role in this.</p>
                <p>Speaking of Germany's role in the Alliance in the mid- to late '70s, there were,
                    of course, prohibitions on the use of German forces outside of Germany,
                    historical and constitutional prohibitions and inhibitions which we are just now
                    seeing in the late '90s with the participation for the first time of German
                    units actually in combat against the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about the Nordic countries, Norway and Denmark?
                        Denmark, of course, is sort of small, but were they considered stout allies,
                        or were they-</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0104" n="Page0104"/>
                <p>HOLMES: The Norwegians were always considered stout allies. The Danes were
                    considered wobbly allies. In both cases, they were reflections of their internal
                    politics; in fact, there was even a rather unfair joke that circulated in NATO
                    one year when the Danish commitment in the Defense Planning Questionnaire
                    exercise that I described was so paltry that people said that they were spending
                    all of their money on putting phone booths on every street corner so citizens
                    could easily run to the telephone and surrender if Denmark were invaded by the
                    Warsaw Pact. But given their performance later on in peacekeeping in Bosnia and
                    elsewhere, I think that was unfair. But the Norwegians were another very small
                    country but were considered strong, reliable allies, and an important ally
                    because other than the Turks, Norway was the only Alliance country that actually
                    shared a border with the Soviet Union up at Kirkenes, and there was a great deal
                    of strategic monitoring taking place in the northern waters, up opposite
                    Murmansk. Murmansk was the biggest strategic nuclear base for the Soviet Navy,
                    and it was out of Murmansk that the large boomers - their submarines carrying
                    intercontinental ballistic missiles - and all their attack submarines, and the
                    great majority of them were based there, and they flowed out of Murmansk out
                    into the North Atlantic to patrol throughout the Cold War. Of course, that's
                    exactly where Norway was very exposed, and they had periodic difficulties where
                    the Soviets were constantly challenging them on fishing rights and also coal
                    rights on Spitsbergen, because in order to maintain their claim to Spitsbergen,
                    the Norwegians would pay citizens very handsome allowance to actually live
                    there. It was claimed by several countries, and of course that was always a bone
                    of contention between the Soviet Union and Norway. That was something we were
                    brought into.</p>
                <p>I'll make a reflection here on what I would call the famous “Nordic balance.”
                    There are basically five Nordic countries - Finland, Sweden, Norway, Iceland,
                    and Denmark - and never has there been a stranger collection of bedfellows in
                    terms of defense matters. Iceland had no military forces. I mean the Icelandic
                    defense force was the US/NATO base at Keflavik, a very important base for us
                    because not only did we have fighter bombers there but most important we had P-3
                    aircraft-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is the Neptune.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, the Neptune was the British variant, I believe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, maybe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: The P-3's were the US variant, and with these, basically, we kept track
                    of the Soviet submarine fleet. We and our allies flew missions our of Keflavik
                    all the way down to the Azores, and I'm talking about Norwegian, US, British,
                    Dutch, Belgian, Canadian aircraft. Everybody participated in this mission.</p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>Anyway, going back to the Nordic balance, you have this curious situation of
                    Iceland. Then you have two other countries that have forces that are members of
                    the Alliance, Norway and Denmark, both of which had pledged never to allow
                    foreign forces on their soil or nuclear weapons on their soil. Then you had
                    Sweden, of course, which given the size of Sweden had a robust defense
                    establishment. They built their own fighter-bombers, the famous artillery pieces
                    that were constructed in Swedish factories, and they had a very strong defense
                    force, and they were neutral. Then finally there was Finland, which always felt
                    somewhat at the mercy of the Soviet Union as a result of the Finnish-Russian War
                    and the treaty and the articles of that treaty which allowed the Soviet Union to
                    intervene in Finnish affairs and Finnish territory if anything should happen
                    that would threaten the Soviet Union. It was a very uncomfortable... It wasn't
                    an alliance; it was an arrangement that came out of the Finnish-Russian War.
                    Part of that bargain was that the Soviet Union agreed to purchase every year a
                    certain number of Finland's exports, so there was kind of an uncomfortable kind
                    of export protection for Finland, but always this sense that if they did
                    anything clumsy or if any of the allies did anything in their waters, that this
                    would stimulate Soviet intervention. The Finns talked about this in the inner
                    Nordic councils, when the five countries would get together to discuss their
                    problems. And there was an understanding that the other members would help
                    Finland. I can't remember now what the incident was, but there was an incident
                    where the Soviet Union actually invoked that article of the Finnish-Russian
                    treaty, and it was something that an Alliance member had done. I should have
                    looked this up, but they were threatening. They were definitely threatening. In
                    a very quiet but unmistakable way, the Norwegians, and I believe perhaps also
                    the Danes, let it be known that if the Soviets intervened in Finnish affairs,
                    they would have to revisit their pledge not to allow allied forces and maybe
                    even accompanied by nuclear units on their territory. They let this be known,
                    and the Soviets got the message and they backed off. I wish I could remember the
                    details of the incident that occurred. It was a very interesting display of this
                    loose collectivity of Scandinavian countries that had a way of protecting each
                    other by using the strategic assets of the two of the three NATO members that
                    actually had their own forces. There was one exception in the Norwegian case.
                    They did not allow US forces or NATO forces to be stationed on their territory;
                    however, they did conclude an agreement to allow a full US Marine Corps brigade
                    set of equipment to be pre-positioned in Norway, so that in the event of an
                    emergency our forces could be flown over very quickly and fall in on their
                    equipment. That sort of took their pledge of no foreign forces stationed on
                    their soil to the limit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Didn't the Marines come once a year?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, yes. They had periodic exercises, and the British would frequently
                    participate in those Nordic exercises, and sometimes the Germans and others. The
                    Germans tended to exercise more in the Baltic approaches exercises with the
                    Danes and also the Norwegians. That was sort of their sector.</p>

                        trouble, or-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, we did, and we stayed in close touch with the Swedes. In fact, one
                    of my duties when I came back from Italy in 1979 to be the principle deputy
                    assistant secretary in the European Bureau, was to make an annual trip to the
                    Scandinavian countries. I never went to our NATO allies without also visiting
                    Sweden. I'd visit them all. It was an annual visit, and we exchanged
                    information. We were very open with them. We kept a very close relationship, and
                    we treated them as if they could be a strategic ally, and they appreciated it.
                    In other words, we shared a great deal of information, and we licensed advanced
                    weaponry to be purchased by their aircraft manufacturers and placed on their
                    fighter bomber aircraft, for example, and various guidance systems and that sort
                    of thing. They, of course, were technologically very advanced. L. M. Ericsson is
                    a world-class company. Once in a while we would have some discussions with them
                    when they wanted to sell an aircraft that had US technology on it to a country,
                    and of course, given our law and our understanding, we would have a discussion
                    with them as to whether or not we would permit the inclusion of the equipment
                    that we had a string on on their aircraft if we didn't approve of the
                    client.</p>

                    There was nothing special going on, except of course there were the periodic
                    difficulties, as far as Belgium was concerned, in the Congo. That always
                    involves some very full diplomatic bilateral activity, and we were both

                <p>HOLMES: Yes, that's right. But when we deployed the INF forces, the Netherlands
                    was one of the countries where we actually had Cruise missiles. We had them in
                    Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, and Italy - that's four - and I we
                    must have had them in Belgium as well. I'm almost certain we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about this deployment. Did this take place

                <p>HOLMES: No, it was a little bit later.</p>

                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>HOLMES: I mention it because the idea had already been launched by Helmut Schmidt
                    when he was chancellor, and it took a while - discussions within the Alliance to
                    sort of prepare the way. But the actual deployments occurred later. I remember
                    very clearly because later when I went to Rome as deputy chief of mission in
                    1977 - and I was there from '77 to '79 - one of the projects that I worked on a
                    lot - and I was charg� quite a bit of the time when this was going on, was
                    working with the Italian Government to prepare a strategy that they could use
                    with their political parties and within Italy to allow the deployment of the
                    cruise missiles, which was a major undertaking, politically and strategically,
                    for them. I remember having lengthy discussions with the prime minister and the
                    defense minister in that time frame, and it was in this sort of '78-79 time
                    frame when that was taking place.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Great Britain in this '75-77 period? Any
                        problems with the British?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, the British would periodically have their fishing wars with their
                    fellow ally the Icelanders, which we would invariably get drawn into. The
                    British played an important strategic role, of course. They were very intent on
                    maintaining the state of the art of their nuclear force, and we allowed them to
                    purchase our most advanced sea-launched ballistic missiles, up to and including
                    the Trident II D missile. The British were very much part of our shared nuclear
                    responsibilities, and they had several ballistic missile submarines that were on
                    patrol with us, and we had undoubtedly the closest strategic relationship with
                    them that we had with any country. It was very important from the British point
                    of view, at a time when they could barely afford it, when they were reducing
                    their conventional forces at what we thought was an alarming rate, they did it
                    in order to be able to continue to afford to purchase and continue to
                    participate in the very expensive nuclear club. The British were very realistic.
                    They knew that as an increasingly small medium-sized power the only way the
                    United States would take them seriously and bring them into global strategic
                    questions was if they had the marbles to play in the big game. They said as
                    much, and they said it to each other. It was just understood that if they
                    stopped doing that they would be very rapidly reduced to a smaller European
                    power and that, yes, we would continue to have a special relationship, but we
                    wouldn't consult them or take them as seriously as when they were full-fledged
                    members of the so-called nuclear club.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, that's right. That was a very interesting... that was a peculiarly
                    Portuguese issue, but it reflected in some respects the experience of the
                    dissolution of empire that other European powers had gone through at different
                    stages - the British, the French, the Italians, the Spanish, the Belgians - all
                    of whom came out of World War II with holdings in Africa, colonies, territories,
                    trust territories, what have you. The Portuguese of course were a charter member
                    of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, but had been neutral in World War II,
                    if not somewhat sympathetic to the Axis cause. They tried desperately to hang
                    onto their empire in Africa, which included Angola and Mozambique,
                    Guinea-Bissau, and the Cape Verde Islands. But the main action was on the
                    continent of Africa, and there were, as everyplace else in Africa, independence
                    movements taking place among the African inhabitants of those countries, but the
                    Portuguese revolution was curious because it kind of ignited itself, in a way,
                    because they fought it for 13 or 14 years, spent a great deal of money, and they
                    kept sending young officers on their second or sometimes third tours back to
                    fight this hopeless colonial war. It was eventually the young Portuguese
                    officers, who were fed up with going to fight this hopeless African war and who
                    became increasingly sympathetic to the cause of some of the movements,
                    particularly in Angola and Mozambique, and it was that group of young officers
                    that came back to Portugal on rotation and were disaffected who basically
                    stimulated the revolution against Salazar and his successor's r�gime. It was a
                    curious evolution that was not replicated that I am aware of in any of the other
                    colonial experiences in Africa.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: Well, I observed it, but as director of RPM I was not a principal player.
                    In other words, the most important Portuguese contributions to NATO from our
                    standpoint was the strategic location of the Azores and the base that we had
                    there, primarily the P-3's and the sub watch - that was what really mattered
                    strategically from our standpoint. The Portuguese force contribution to NATO was
                    never very significant. In the Atlantic command, there was a subordinate command
                    in metropolitan Portugal, actually in Lisbon, of the Atlantic command, which is
                    not part of SACEUR but SACLANT responsibility. But we were certainly aware of
                    it. Kissinger was very much into it, and Frank Carlucci, beginning in about
                    1975. In either late '74 or early '75 he went there and played a major role,
                    really a major role - in fact, Frank Carlucci to this day is known as somewhat
                    of a folk hero among the Portuguese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I've interviewed Frank, and others have talked about it. I
                        think it's one of the great stories of the Foreign Service, of going there
                        without the support of the Secretary of State - in fact, Kissinger was very
                        dubious about this-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, Frank probably recounted for you his famous conversation with
                    Kissinger, when they threw the notetakers out of the room and literally went to
                    the mat, and Frank told Kissinger to stop his Spenglerian pronouncements of doom
                    about what was happening in southern Europe, because he was talking not only
                    about Portugal but also about the growing Euro-Communism phenomenon. Kissinger,
                    without paying much attention to it, it troubled him. So Carlucci asked him to
                    stop. He said, “You're not helping. You're making matters worse.” Kissinger
                    said, “Well, do you want me to shut up?” and Franck said, “Yes, I'll handle it.
                    Please stay out of it.” I mean, it was a rather gutsy performance, and of course
                    Frank, at that point, had been working in the White House. He was very close to
                    Ford, so he had a kind of independent base of strength.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: That's right, he had his own lines into the White House. As a matter of
                    fact, when he came back on consultation from Lisbon at that particular time, he
                    had made an appointment in the White House, I think to see the President. Then
                    he got an appointment with Kissinger. Obviously, the staff had told Kissinger
                    that he had seen the President. So at the end of his difficult discussion with
                    Kissinger, in which he made his point and got his way, as he was going out the
                    door, he said that he needed to get back to Lisbon and he was going to just
                    cancel his appointments in the White House because he had to get back.</p>

                <p>But Frank played a major role, and I heard a lot about it later when I went to
                    Portugal as ambassador. Basically, his role was to cajole the democratic party
                    leaders in Portugal to come together - socialists and social democrats and the
                    more conservative elements - to basically put together a functioning government,
                    to reform the country, and to not allow the very Stalinist Portuguese Communist
                    Party to divide the opposition and basically take over. It was kind of
                    touch-and-go for a while, and he got some funds out of Washington, basically to
                    help the Portuguese rebuild their military forces, after many years of neglect
                    of their Alliance contributions because of this colonial war, to rebuild a force
                    that could take its place alongside other NATO forces. This was very important
                    because it meant that these units that were coming back out of Africa would have
                    a mission. They could be put to work and focus on Europe rather than being
                    available for political activism within Portugal. It was a very smart move on
                    his part, and working with the democratic leaders to make them understand how
                    important it was for these rather loose elements of former military to be given
                    a real mission that would be directed towards their treaty responsibilities in
                    the North Atlantic Alliance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, moving along - Italy. You mentioned how Italy
                        was a good ally the whole time. Were there any problems with Italy? Were we
                        concerned about the 25 or 30 percent Communist Party?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, we were obviously always concerned about the Communist Party and
                    the size of the Communist vote, and the sort of fringe vote that wasn't
                    Communist but was sympathetic frequently to their viewpoint marked out the
                    boundaries of what Italy was prepared to do in certain circumstances. But I
                    thought they did a rather remarkable job, the Italians did, given the hostility
                    of the Communist Party to the very important NATO and US military stake in Italy
                    and our presence there. We were in, I think, 50 to 55 different locations, some
                    of them very small, around Italy, and of course a major NATO headquarters of
                    Allied Forces South in Naples. But the hospitality to American men-of-war with
                    nuclear weapons, ships that were nuclear powered and that also had nuclear
                    weapons - we really never had any major difficulties with the Italians over the
                    “neither confirm nor deny” policy with respect to ships that would call at
                    Italian ports. Despite the major efforts of the Communist Party to play on the
                    lack of information and fears of many Italians that it would be dangerous to
                    have our nuclear-powered vessels in Italian waters and that they would
                    contaminate their fishing beds and their tourist industry and that it would be
                    bad for the health of the... I mean all of those kinds of arguments were, in the
                    final analysis, of no avail. The Italian Government continued, within their own
                    parliament, to defend our access to their ports. We had access, I can remember,
                    at one point to as many as six ports in Italy, with nuclear-powered vessels.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I was still dealing with that later when I came on board in the
                    Bureau of European Affairs as the senior deputy in 1979. That went on for a very
                    long time. That was a major crisis, not only in Greek-Turkish relations but also
                    in our own relations with both countries and our own strategic stake in our
                    intelligence listening posts in Turkey, because when the Turks went into Cyprus
                    and established the little Turkish republic there in the northern part of the
                    island, the Greek lobby and others in the United States moved very quickly to
                    cut off aid to Turkey and had a lot of the cooperation ground to a standstill,
                    and at one point the Turks, in retaliation, closed down some of our bases. You
                    remember. That worried us a lot, particularly those bases in Turkey that were
                    monitoring Soviet military activities.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Particularly missile launches.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>HOLMES: And missile launches in particular. What was very curious, I always
                    thought later, was the extent to which the other ethnic lobbies within our
                    Congress supported that, even though, clearly, it was not in the strategic
                    interest of Israel and its supporters in the Congress to not be able to count on
                    that kind of early warning in the event of another round of fighting between
                    Israel and its Arab neighbors because of the Soviet relationship particularly
                    with Syria. There was always a concern about what the Soviets might do, and so
                    from a strategic point of view I always thought it was essential that the
                    Israelis would count on our being able to have that whole monitoring network up
                    and running at all times. Yet that connection was never really made by AIPAC and
                    the Israeli lobby with their supporters in Congress, who continued steadfastly
                    to support this embargo. It wasn't until about 1979 or early 1980 when Matt
                    Nimitz, I believe, the counselor for the Department of State, was assigned the
                    responsibility to negotiate an end to this problem, the lifting of the embargo.
                    So it really wasn't solved until about 1980, and it went on for about six years.
                    This was a major problem. And certainly, it continued to poison the
                    Greek-Turkish relationship, and obviously that had an effect on the Alliance,
                    and it meant that a lot of the trilateral and quadrilateral naval and air
                    exercises and activity in the Mediterranean were hamstrung by this quarrel.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at the other side of the hill, what was the
                        feeling about the Soviet Union at that time as a threat to NATO? How did we
                        see the threat?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, we were very concerned, always were, about the Soviet nuclear
                    threat. One of the reasons, going back to the very important INF deployments,
                    this was a major move on our part, and addressed directly the Soviet threat. In
                    other words, we thought it was essential to build up our theater nuclear weapons
                    in order to be able to negotiate the Soviet Union down, in terms of their
                    strategic threat. We were very concerned about that, and there had been a lag in
                    our strategic arms control negotiations in the mid-'70s, between the time of the
                    first ABM and SALT I treaties that had been negotiated basically by Kissinger
                    and what happened later. There was a period when the Soviets were building, they
                    were fielding more and more improved weapons, larger weapons with more... I'm
                    talking about strategic intercontinental ballistic missiles with more multiple
                    reentry vehicles, including of course the SS-18, the one that got our attention.
                    We were very concerned, and the Alliance was concerned. There were some very
                    private discussions in the Alliance at the time, within NATO, to ensure that
                    SACEUR would always have available some 400 reentry vehicles from US strategic
                    submarines that would be available to the Alliance, to SACEUR, if we ever really
                    would have to go to war with the Soviet Union. This was in addition, of course,
                    to our strategic weapons and to our tactical nuclear weapons. Most Alliance air
                    forces had nuclear bombs - gravity bombs - available, certainly the Greeks, the
                    Turks, Belgians, Dutch, Germans, Canadians, US, Italians. There were strategic
                    ammunition sites in all of those countries. We worried about the ones obviously
                    in Greece and Turkey just because of the very bad relationship between those two
                    countries. So in addition to the air force capabilities of tactical nuclear
                    weapons, we also had our strategic weapons and then the all-important sea-launch
                    ballistic missile reentry vehicles that were available to SACEUR.</p>
                <p>When we played nuclear exercises in the Alliance, some Alliance members were very
                    nervous about that, particularly the Germans - understandably.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you played these things, did you see... Was it a matter
                        of mutual destruction, or was there a way one could actually fight a war
                        without committing suicide with nuclear weapons?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0114" n="Page0114"/>
                <p>HOLMES: That was always the question, and these scenarios that were played out
                    would inevitably lead to a point where you had to fish or cut bait. It was a
                    question of were we going to have a nuclear demonstration or were we going to
                    try to confine nuclear weapons to one sector, and was it possible to do so? I
                    think most people realized that if we went that route it wouldn't be possible,
                    that it would unleash a horrific global exchange. So in the Alliance some of the
                    most difficult moments came when, in approving exercises that involved a nuclear
                    scenario and then actually playing it out... and I can remember on at least one
                    occasion when the game was aborted simply because certain members of the
                    Alliance, primarily the Germans, didn't want to go to the next step in the
                    decision-making that would lead to the end of the game. Senior members played
                    these games - perhaps not full-time, but at certain points. A game typically
                    would last four or five days, and you would have cadres of young diplomats and
                    military of all members of the Alliance playing the game in their capitals, and
                    as I say, I do remember one occasion where we actually had to abort the game
                    before the final steps because the Germans simply didn't want to take it that
                    far.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned nuclear. What about the conventional side?
                        Was this seen as going to be almost not an issue because the things would
                        turn nuclear pretty quickly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No. We in the United States, at least, and other allies to some degree,
                    were intent on developing the most modern, robust conventional forces possible
                    because we didn't want to do exactly what you're suggesting - just consider it
                    an inevitability that we would get very quickly to a nuclear war. We were intent
                    on maintaining two US Corps for a long time at full strength, and the French had
                    their forces, and the Germans, and we worked very hard at persuading our allies
                    to keep their NATO pledges up and to exercise and to use new weapons like the
                    uranium-depleted rounds and new tactics, so there would not be an easy or
                    inevitable reliance on nuclear weapons. That said, we always maintained...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were saying you'd never go down a road-</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, we were very careful with the Soviets to never entertain the notion
                    of a no first nuclear weapons pledge with them, and this was sort of an Alliance
                    strategic canon. We were absolutely determined, and we made it clear publicly,
                    that we reserved the right to use nuclear weapons at any point in the escalation
                    of conflict that seemed in the Alliance's interest to do so. So the Soviets
                    could not make an easy calculation, that we were not going to go up some kind of
                    strategic ladder rung by rung. We did that because we knew that despite our best
                    efforts at arming and training the North Atlantic Alliance forces the Soviets,
                    in a strictly classic, conventional war, could overwhelm certainly certain
                    sectors of he Alliance, coming either through the north German plain or through
                    the Fulda Gap. It would have been extremely difficult. I don't think anybody
                    kidded themselves into thinking that if the Soviets had decided to wage an
                    all-out conventional war we would have had to use nuclear weapons at a certain
                    point to stop that. We were very careful always to maintain that strategic
                    principle: that we reserved the right to introduce, always in a defensive... I
                    mean we would never, obviously... we are a defensive alliance - we will not
                    initiate war with the Soviet Union, but once started, we reserve the right to
                    use nuclear weapons at any point of conflict.</p>

                        office and the Pentagon route about the American Army at this particular

                        over. The Army had been suffering from drug problems, racial problems and

                    Fort Knox and spent a day with soldiers. We also went to visit the Marine Corps.

                <p>HOLMES: Yes, it was Charleston, I believe. But in terms of troops going through
                    basic training and the attitudes of troops - this was 1974-1975 - we were out of
                    Vietnam, the armed forces were hard at work at that point developing a health
                    strategy. Basically they were busy developing their zero-tolerance policy with
                    respect to drug use, because it had had a devastating effect on our forces in
                    Vietnam, and some very dedicated officers were determined to turn that around as
                    rapidly as possible - people such as General Barry McCaffrey stayed in the Army
                    and were determined to reform it from within, and they did a remarkable job. But
                    we were still feeling our way. We were repairing the damage. There was a little
                    bit of the psychosis of defeat that had resulted from our departure from
                    Vietnam, and this plus the drugs had had, I think, a very devastating effect not
                    only on the morale but also on the self-confidence and, indeed, the capability
                    of the armed forces. We saw that. At least I remember being struck by the sort
                    of flaccid approach to training at Fort Knox, for example. We spent that day
                    with the troops, we ate with them in the mess hall, and we talked with them; and
                    I was shocked by how... It was almost like an expensive boarding school. The
                    armed forces were so worried that somehow the parents or the Congress or
                    somebody would react badly if they trained them too hard. The training, the
                    physical conditioning, was pathetic. They were really feeling their way at that
                    time, walking on eggshells to keep the troops happy, to make their barracks life
                    comfortable, to ensure that they had access to schooling at night - which was
                    fine; that obviously was a major draw to bring people into the armed forces. But
                    even in the Marine Corps, which had always been a volunteer force, it seemed to
                    me when we visited the troops there, that they too were suffering to a lesser
                    degree but somewhat the same attitude, the same approach. So I think that the
                    armed forces were just sort of bottoming out of their post-Vietnam crisis and
                    that from that point on they would build back their self-respect, their
                    training, their capability in a major way, so that by the time that Ronald
                    Reagan was elected President in 1980, they had come a long way in a relatively
                    short time in dealing with the drug problem and reinstalling a sense of
                    discipline and purpose in the armed forces. Reagan did a lot to restore their
                    sense of pride and the appreciation for the armed forces within the United
                    States.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In '77, you got an assignment to where?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: In 1977, I was asked by Richard Gardner, who was a professor at Columbia
                    University and very close to Brzezinski and Vance and to President Carter, with
                    whom actually Gardner had worked in the Trilateral Commission, and who was
                    practically the first ambassador appointed by the Carter Administration, to
                    Italy - and Gardner was a long-time friend of mine - to come with him as his
                    deputy chief of mission. So I went to Italy in the summer of 1977.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Richard Gardner was ambassador there until '81, when he
                        left, and then later he went to Spain.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, in this administration, the Clinton Administration.</p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's a major player in the diplomatic field. Could you
                        tell me how he approached the job and how he used you and how we worked with
                        the Italians during this time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Dick Gardner's concept was a very interesting one, and I have to say that
                    he and his wife really played it as a partnership. His wife, Danielle Gardner,
                    was of Italian origin. Her parents had been forced to flee Italy by the racial
                    laws. They were Italian Jews.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From Venice, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Her mother was from Venice, and her father was from Rome. They actually
                    left from Genoa and escaped and came to the United States. But the Gardner
                    family did an enormous job, and they had a strategic concept basically of
                    outreach, of reaching to every segment of Italian society. It was sort of the
                    ideal that most ambassadors would like to do but generally do not. By that I
                    mean that chiefs of mission in most countries tend to get so involved in the
                    day-to-day, week-to-week diplomatic flow of issues that they tend to put aside
                    what I would say intellectual, academic, cultural outreach. The Gardners had
                    decided that they wanted to do that and pursued it during their entire time in
                    Italy. I had served there, of course, before and in other countries; I had never
                    seen a chief of mission carry out that kind of a strategy to the extent that the
                    Gardners did. In the way that they entertained, in their visits around the
                    country, they of course met with political leaders and labor leaders and
                    business leaders but also writers and artists and Italian cinematographic
                    producers, and it was a very exciting time. Gardner himself was a brilliant
                    international lawyer and an international monetary expert, probably the leading
                    academic figure on international organization affairs, and so he was very keen
                    on getting out to all the provinces of Italy and making substantive speeches. He
                    was very careful not to just make Columbus Day speeches. He would pick his
                    audience carefully, and he would address Carter's nuclear policies or talk about
                    the environment or strategic issues or commercial issues. He had, I thought, a
                    very interesting approach and a game plan for not only reaching out to every
                    segment of Italian society but also to carry Carter Administration policies to
                    the people of Italy.</p>
                <p>Basically my role - we had a sort of an understanding that we used to laugh and
                    talk about: Mr. Outside and Mr. Inside. We had a very large diplomatic and
                    military establishment in Italy, so Dick Gardner wanted to be free to pursue
                    these activities, and he basically left the running of the mission to me. We had
                    seven or eight constituent posts at the time - I think maybe eight - and I think
                    it was 55 military installations, going from a very large establishment at NATO
                    headquarters in Naples to a small communication relay point on a mountainside,
                    where there maybe were three people.</p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>So that was really my job, to run the establishment, the consulates, and maintain
                    that kind of close embassy contact and oversight with the military commands.
                    Most of the commands, of course, were under the Joint Chiefs of Staff Integrated
                    Military Command Structure, but they were serving in Italy, and it was very
                    important to have close policy contact and oversight so that they would carry
                    out their duties within the context of Carter foreign policy in Italy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One of the things that impressed me about Ambassador
                        Gardner was that he had both the credentials and the intellectual
                        capabilities to engage with both the academic and the students, which most
                        of our ambassadors... I mean, very difficult time, and these tended to be
                        rather radical and to the left. It was just part of the Italian scheme of
                        things. Did you notice this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, and he worked very hard at his Italian. Obviously,
                        his wife was bilingual, but he learned to speak good Italian and had a very
                        good understanding. There were times where sensitive subjects were discussed
                        where he would use an interpreter just to be sure that he was accurate, but
                        over a period of four years he got to the point where he was really doing
                        most of his business in Italian without the help of an interpreter. Yes, he
                        did have that knack of engaging people in policy discussion - academics, of
                        course. He did talk with students, graduate students and young professors,
                        but he also used his staff to do some of that. I remember in particular he
                        recruited a remarkable man named Daniel Serwer, who was a scientist, had a
                        Ph.D. in the history of science from Princeton and was at Brookhaven
                        Laboratories at the time. Dick Gardner had known him at some point in some
                        UN work that he had been doing on the environment. So he recruited Serwer to
                        take an appointment as his science attach�. Serwer knew French, but he
                        didn't know Italian, but he was a gifted linguist and learned Italian so
                        quickly and so well that he would go down into the “lions' den,” which was
                        the nuclear physics faculty at the University of Rome, which was extremely
                        radical and extremely critical of United States policy, and he would stand
                        up there and explain and defend Carter policy to a disbelieving and
                        initially hostile audience, and at the end - although he perhaps didn't win
                        many converts - they would crowd around and ask him for help to get
                        scholarships in American universities. So Gardner was very good at using his
                        best people in the embassy to help, particularly with younger officers, to
                        get them to go out and talk with students.</hi>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Something we talked about the last time you were in Italy,
                        but I'd like to bring up again. Here you were looking at the inside, and
                        it's a theme I always like to bring up with people who served in Italy, and
                        that is the involvement we get with the political process in Rome, which at
                        least during the 40-odd postwar years, until things really broke loose after
                        the time we're dealing with, was that there really wasn't much of a change.
                        The Communists and their supporters got about 30 percent of the vote; the
                        Christian Democrats were in. There was a constant change in government,
                        switching ministries and all this, and we had a rather large political
                        section that was reporting on all the sort of political minuet that went on
                        in here, where really, it seems that one man and a young boy could almost
                        report on what was happening really in Italian politics.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, you're absolutely right. When I went back as deputy chief of
                    mission ten years later, very little had changed, and this sizable political
                    section was even more of an anachronism by then than it had been ten years
                    before. In a way, Dick Gardner and I perpetuated that anachronism because both
                    of us got very interested in the political parties and their leaders and their
                    writings and their newspapers, and we'd read all that stuff and then ask
                    questions. Our political officers would then have to go and research it, if they
                    didn't have the answer, and so we kind of perpetuated that, in a way, because it
                    was interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It traps one.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: It does trap one, and we were both political scientists - I mean Dick
                    Gardner was and I was - and we were fascinated by this. Now there was one
                    strategic game, and that was to keep the Communists out of the government. That
                    was the overriding issue that Gardner had, at least, from Vance and Brzezinski
                    from Washington: for God's sake, don't let this “historic compromise” happen. We
                    can't have the Italian Communists and Italian Catholics coming together in one
                    government. What would that do to our strategic stake in Italy and in the
                    Mediterranean? So this was a major issue throughout the time that Dick and I
                    were together in Italy, making sure that this did not happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there anyone within the embassy or outside saying,
                        “Look at this...” Because the French model was to appear later on, what
                        Mitterrand did to the Communists, which he told you before, how he would do
                        this. Was anybody in the embassy saying, “Let's not get too hung up on this
                        historic compromise because the Communists will be swallowed up?” Or was
                        this either practical or sort of an article of faith that one couldn't
                        question the infallibility of this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, there was one officer in the Political Section who was very smart
                    and who basically took a different view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>HOLMES: I think his name was Fred Spotts. Anyway, he was very effective. His view
                    was not so much that there would be some Italian variant of the French model,
                    which by the way hadn't happened by that time, but more that this was
                    inevitable, that Euro-Communism, which was Communism with a kinder face,
                    Communism with a more centrist, mixed-economy, mixed-capitalist-socialist system
                    was inevitable. This was happening in Spain; this was going to happen in Italy.
                    There were people that espoused that point of view, that this was an inevitable
                    evolution and that we shouldn't try to stop it but that we should try to guide
                    it. That was the point of view here. But this one individual - and I always
                    encouraged him to speak out and to write up analyses of his point of view and to
                    defend it. I thought it was very good for people's thinking. But he was
                    definitely sort of a committee of one, because it certainly didn't shake the
                    implacable opposition, not only of our embassy but basically the Administration.
                    After all, Brzezinski was the National Security Council advisor and had a very
                    strong view on this. If you'll recall, in the Carter Administration we had
                    basically three secretaries of state. We had Vance, and we had Brzezinski, and
                    we had Andy Young in New York. It was a troika approach to foreign policy in the
                    United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find that you were up against an Italian
                        establishment within the Foreign Service, both at the Desk of the European
                        Bureau and in the consulates and all and at the embassy, of people who had
                        served in Italy again and again and again?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In a way there's always the problem of arteriosclerosis or

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, there was a certain amount of that. I have to agree with that. There
                    were a number of individuals who had served several times in Italy, and of
                    course to the extent that they were serving in the consulates in the provinces,
                    their background and rather conservative outlook, going back to the end of World
                    War II, was reinforced frequently by the provincial leaders they met. Now the
                    one exception to that would have been, of course, our consulate in Florence,
                    where there was a very strong Communist establishment, strong Communist Party,
                    and a lot of questioning, even among the elite of Tuscany of this implacable
                    opposition to Communism. Bologna was one of the Communist strongholds in Italy,
                    and Pisa, and that whole area.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0121" n="Page0121"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, it was really the Red Belt, and people used that term. But I would
                    say that when Bob Gordon was our consul general in Florence, Bob paid attention
                    to this, and he reported on it, to the extent - and he met these people and
                    would talk with them and report on their conversations. He made an effort to
                    explain United States policy, and Bob had a certain sophistication. He was a
                    political scientist by training, had done his graduate work at Berkeley, and
                    although Bob had been in Italy (he was in Italy the second time, as I was, and
                    we had the same sort of ten year separation - he was my boss as the political
                    military counselor when I was in Italy the first time, and then he ends up as
                    consul general in Florence when I'm the DCM in Rome), Bob did not fall under
                    that easy conservative, no-new-thinking approach of some of the other consular
                    officials. Bob had a very probing, inquiring attitude about it, and enjoyed
                    bringing the thoughts and issues that he'd encountered in the Red Belt to the
                    attention of the embassy in Rome. It was very good, and it was appreciated by
                    Dick Gardner and certainly by me - I mean, we were old friends. But he was
                    rather the exception.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view from your perspective, I think, the head
                        of the Communist Party, Berlinguer?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Enrico Berlinguer, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did we view him at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, he was a political satrap. He was a very important figure in Italy.
                    In fact, if I'm not mistaken, he was related, a cousin, I believe, of Francesco
                    Cossiga. I think Berlinguer was - I may be mistaken, but I believe he was -
                    Sardinian.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He was a Sardinian. I'm quite sure.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I think he was a cousin of Francesco Cossiga, who at the time when I was
                    there this time, was minister of interior and later became prime minister and
                    eventually president of Italy. Berlinguer was a figure, and a strong foe. In
                    fact, he was considered as such. He was the head of the Italian Communist Party,
                    and we wanted to keep them in their box, did not want them to come into power.
                    If Dick Gardner or I met him, we were polite. We would chat with him, if we met
                    him at a function, but we didn't seek to develop a relationship with him. Dick
                    Gardner wanted to have more contact with the Communist leaders, and it was
                    difficult, given his very public figure and given the policy of the US
                    Government, to do so. But every once in a while, at a small dinner party, there
                    would be a Communist figure, and he'd make a point of talking to them,
                    listening, trying to sound them out on issues.</p>

                        sort of reported to Washington and so whatever you got ended up through a
                        filter and so it wasn't really very useful at the time.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, actually, we had a very good - an exceptional - chief of station, who
                    was an old friend of mine. I had served with him earlier, in France, as a matter
                    of fact, where he'd been the deputy chief of station. A very scholarly
                    individual who didn't collect spy stories and gun books like some I have known,
                    but when I went into his office, the books that he read - and I could see that
                    he was reading - were history, biography. This man was an exceptional linguist.
                    He spoke excellent Italian, French, Russian, Ukrainian - really a remarkable
                    linguist and a very intelligent guy, and we had a good relationship,
                    particularly when I was charg�, which was a lot of the time. I was charg�
                    d'affaires about one third of the time that I was there. The station chief and I
                    worked very closely together, and I had the advantage of knowing, even in its
                    raw, undigested form, what was going on. Those contacts, the intelligence
                    information gathered by the Agency in Italy, everything that had to do with
                    Italian politics - of course, that had to be shared with the ambassador anyway,
                    but because of my special relationship with him, and we were both old Italian
                    hands, in effect, I was able to know what was going on early. He had some very
                    good people on his staff. He had two people in particular whom I remember, one
                    of whom was European-born and the other was not, but both were old Italians
                    hands, absolutely bilingual in Italian and knew the country inside-out, had been
                    there many times before, were very, very skillful in getting around and
                    gathering information and doing special missions. Unfortunately, because they
                    were specialists, not generalists, when Admiral Stansfield Turner carried out
                    his massive shrinking of the Agency, the pink slip campaign, which was a minor
                    atomic explosion within the career overseas operations people of the Agency, the
                    most knowledgeable and skilled people were the ones who got the pink slips,
                    because they were specialists. If you had to cut - at least that seemed to be
                    the attitude in the Agency - they wanted to save their generalists, and they cut
                    their specialists, which I though was absolutely insane. It was a very bad move.
                    They lost their two best people, and I knew them both very well and I knew their
                    quality, during that downsizing (I hate that word, but...). No, we had an
                    excellent relationship, and really this particular station chief, the work of
                    his people contributed very directly to the mission objectives of the embassy
                    and of the administration. In fact, I set up a special committee that I chaired
                    that had the station chief and the FBI representative - which was very unusual
                    because normally they just operated on their own in those days - and the defense
                    representatives in our own Political Section. For certain issues I would bring
                    in other officers. We met at least once very two weeks, sometimes on a weekly
                    basis, basically to share information but also to establish targets, sort of
                    tactical objectives, things that we knew we had to learn about in order to be
                    able to contribute to our overall strategic objectives in the country. This
                    became particularly important because the Red Brigades were on the rampage and
                    were becoming more than a nuisance, were becoming a major threat to the
                    viability-</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moro was killed.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, Moro - I was in the middle of that. I don't know if we've discussed
                    this before, but I was charg�. By the way, during this whole period, the Red
                    Brigades were moving more and more vigorously in their campaign to bring down
                    the Italian Government. At first they would “knee-cap.” They would shoot people
                    in the knees. Then they began to kill people. The Italian Government had a very
                    hard time coping with this because, as their campaign of terror expanded,
                    Italian companies and parastatal organization would hire security officers, and
                    what they did was, they could pay carabinieri [Italian: police], if they would
                    take early retirement, very good salaries, and so a lot of people were
                    responding to that, and the Italian carabinieri, the paramilitary force that was
                    in every village of every province in Italy and allowed the Ministry of Interior
                    an intelligence network second to none - they were denuded very quickly,
                    because, one, they were drawing out very good carabinieri officers and NCOs to
                    be security officers but also then the carabinieri drew more from the provinces
                    to form their rapid-response teams, their strike teams, which they had not had
                    before and which they suddenly saw a need for. So the carabinieri were
                    diminishing in strength and in its ability to gather intelligence, and at about
                    that time the two intelligence services, the SISDE and the SISME, which were the
                    intelligence services of the Ministry of Interior and of the Ministry of
                    Defense, were in the throes of a huge reorganization. So all this was going on
                    at the very time that the Red Brigades was growing in strength.</p>
                <p>We in the embassy had taken pains to instruct all of our people to vary their
                    routes and the times of going to work and coming home. We had a fluent Italian
                    American regional security officer (RSO) who set up a sort of a command center
                    in his office with a map of Rome with all of the schools on it where our
                    children were going to school, because one never knew from day to day where
                    there might be another Red Brigade attack on a carabinieri post or a police
                    station or what have you. So he set this up, and he had all the schools located
                    on this, and then an employee in his office monitored the police network all day
                    long so as to be able to track the part of the city where there were problems.
                    Sometimes we would be in touch with the schools and suggest that they leave
                    early or that they delay the departure. So we had a rather elaborate scheme for
                    basically protecting the American children in these various schools, because
                    there were several schools around town where they were.</p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>So already, we were well into this, and one day when I was charg� d'affaires and
                    I was heading out of Rome - I was going to make a speech someplace - I was just
                    on the outskirts of the city when I had a phone call from the motor pool saying
                    that the minister of the Interior wanted to see me immediately. So I turned
                    around, and I went to see Francesco Cossiga, who said, “We have had this
                    distressing news that Aldo Moro has been taken hostage by the Red Brigades.”
                    Aldo Moro was the father figure of the Christian Democratic movement in Italy.
                    He'd been prime minister several times. He was not prime minister at the time,
                    but he was the head of the party and a revered senior statesman - and had
                    violated all the basic norms of protection against terrorists by religiously
                    following the same routine every day, so he was an easy target. Cossiga said to
                    me, “Holmes, we are on our knees. We don't know what we're doing. We have no
                    concept of crisis management. Our security services are being reorganized. The
                    carabinieri are ineffective. We need help. Please ask your government to help
                    us.”</p>
                <p>So I immediately called the Department and got them to send out an expert, whose
                    name will come to me in a moment - Steve Pieczenik. Steve Pieczenik had been
                    hired by Larry Eagleburger in an earlier period and was a psychiatrist,
                    political scientist, extremely bright, who had done a lot of research, reading
                    and writing, about the phenomenon of terrorism and the phenomenon of negotiating
                    with terrorists. He knew a lot about it. So he came out very quickly. He was
                    there the next morning, and we immediately went into a huddle with the station
                    chief in his more secure location, and we talked for several hours about the
                    situation, briefed him, and then after that we grabbed a bite of lunch and went
                    immediately over to see Francesco Cossiga, the minister of interior. Steve and I
                    basically talked with him. He laid out a game plan for the kind of crisis
                    management team that we advised them to put together to deal with this
                    situation, and then we lived through the 55 days when Italy searched for Aldo
                    Moro, and the Italian Government came very close to negotiating with the Red
                    Brigades on an equal basis, they were so desperate to get Aldo Moro back. But
                    they resisted. In the final analysis, they didn't do that. They continued to
                    treat the Red Brigades the way they should have been treated, not acceding to
                    their various demands. Then one day, they found him murdered in the trunk of a
                    car that was parked equidistant between the headquarters of the Communist Party
                    and the headquarters of the Christian Democratic Party - which was a point they
                    were making.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How were we responding to the Red Brigades? Were we seeing
                        them as under the control of anyone, or how did we see them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>HOLMES: No, we saw the Red Brigades for what they were. The Red Brigades
                    basically was a home-grown terrorist movement mostly populated by radical
                    left-wing students, children of the middle class, whose point was that they had
                    a sort of ideologically pure sense of what Communism was about, what government
                    should be, and they saw both the Communist Party of Italy and, or course, the
                    Christian Democrats as violating this. To them the worst possible outcome was
                    that there would be a historic compromise. I mean that's the one thing we agreed
                    with them about. They wanted the Italian Republic by a real socialist r�gime,
                    and that was their goal.</p>
                <p>Now they did get some help. They had some training. They had training in
                    Czechoslovakia. The had some contact with the Red Army Faction in Germany.
                    Through this training center in Czechoslovakia, there was certainly a Soviet
                    Communist attempt to influence the Red Brigades, but mostly they financed their
                    own operations through kidnappings. That's how they built up their war chest,
                    and they had periodic meetings. They had a cellular structure of their
                    organization, which prevented for a long time any penetration. They published
                    political tracts, and you would find them occasionally strategically dumped in
                    trash cans, and then people would be told where they were. Mostly they were
                    after political leaders in Italy, but after a while they began to target and
                    talk about NATO and the United States as enemies, and that got our attention and
                    we sort of redoubled our security efforts. We were very careful, Dick Gardner
                    and I, when going on trips. Gardner always had a security detail. I did not,
                    except when I traveled outside of Rome. That was partly because the Italian
                    authorities knew that I was absolutely religious in varying my way. Sometimes I
                    would walk to work, walk through the park, I would go different ways, sometimes
                    I would ride and vary my times by 30 or 40 minutes a day and never the same path
                    two days running. It worked. You just get into that sort of mode and habit. You
                    learn to be street-smart after a while. But of course eventually, as you
                    remember, that was after I left Italy, they did capture an American general
                    officer, General Dozier, and he was eventually released, largely because of just
                    solid police work - obviously we gave as much help as we could - tracing down
                    leads and by a process of elimination and being alert to unusual patterns,
                    finally they narrowed the place down to a certain part of - was it Milan? - this
                    was after I left - a large Italian city in the north. They had a stakeout in
                    this one neighborhood, and in talking, I guess, to the shopkeepers, they learned
                    that a woman would come every day, who ostensibly lived alone, but she would buy
                    a lot of food every day, and so that's how...</p>
                <p>Eventually they knew that Dozier was in this apartment, and the had a SWAT team
                    that moved in very quickly and rescued him.</p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>But I'd like to make a point here. I think there were really three critical
                    moments in Italy's struggle with their home-grown terrorism. The first was that
                    they resisted the temptation to do just about anything, even to the extent of
                    negotiating with the Red Brigades for the release of Aldo Moro. They resisted
                    that, and that would have had a terrible effect, I think, on the viability of
                    the Italian Republic. The second thing was actually, after having lost
                    confidence in their own ability to do good police work and rebuilding of their
                    intelligence services, the fact that they rescued General Dozier. That was a
                    tremendous boost to their regained self-confidence. The third thing, of course,
                    was winning the World Cup in soccer.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: Yes, we were. The longer that state went on, the more concerned we were,
                    and it was absolutely true that there was a small political class of Christian
                    Democratic leaders - and even the leadership of the other parties, Republicans
                    and the Socialists and the Social Democrats - that tended to be small cliques of
                    politicians who were constantly elected and reelected and reshuffled. Andreotti
                    was kind of the quintessence of the Italian political operative of that time. He
                    had been in every Italian government since De Gaspari, where he started as a
                    young man as an undersecretary. He had served in practically every ministry of
                    the Italian Government, and it had been long whispered - it wasn't an open
                    rumor, but it had been whispered - that he was corrupt, that he had payoffs and
                    kickbacks and contacts with the mafia, but nobody was ever able to document it.
                    There were the Lockheed scandals, where there were some kickbacks for various
                    Italian politicians, and there was a code word that appeared called “antelope
                    cobbler.” It was sort of an article of faith never said in writing but whispered
                    around town that “antelope cobbler” was Andreotti. Today, he's still awaiting
                    sentencing as we speak.</p>
                <pb facs="0127" n="Page0127"/>
                <p>But Andreotti was a fascinating figure, and I remember going one time when I was
                    charg�. I had been instructed to go and see him. It may have had to do with the
                    deployment of the Cruise missiles, but I can't remember exactly what the issue
                    was. But I was struck. I went into this ornate 16th-century palace where the
                    prime minister of Italy has his offices, in this huge room with wonderful
                    tapestries and post-renaissance paintings, and there was this beautiful desk
                    where he sat. He invited me to sit in an armchair in front of the desk. The
                    first thing that struck me was that next to this beautiful ancient desk was a
                    small telephone switchboard of the kind that you would see in a provincial
                    American hotel in the '30s. It had about a dozen jacks and plugs. I saw this
                    curious thing and couldn't quite understand what was going on, until the first
                    phone call came through, while we were having this long discussion, just the two
                    of us. (There were no notetaker in the room, just the two of us). A phone call
                    came through, and he handled it himself. He pulled a jack out and plugged it in
                    and answered. It was clear to me that he had several direct lines. He took this
                    phone call, and he said, “Yes, yes... I think so... Just a minute please.” Then
                    instead of going to sort of a formal agenda on his desk, he took out of his
                    breast pocket this moth-eaten little calendar and flipped through it and found a
                    date that was suitable for his respondent and him to have dinner together, and
                    then they made the date, and he wrote it in his own hand in this little thing,
                    and then that was the end of the conversation. Although he didn't make a second
                    date, he had a second phone call while we were talking. There again, he operated
                    his own switchboard.</p>
                <p>Now, I concluded from that two things. One of the strengths of Andreotti's
                    political career was that whatever ministry he served in he quickly identified
                    the most clever civil servants among the senior cadres of the professional civil
                    servants of that ministry, made friends with them, got them into his sort of
                    ambience, his circle of influence - and then, always kept contact with them when
                    he moved to other ministries. So he had a network that was second to none, which
                    was one of his strengths as a political leader in Italy. The other thing that I
                    concluded from this was that he also knew how to protect himself. It was by
                    handling his own conversations, his own phone calls, keeping his own diary - no
                    one was going to be able to track his activities. Very clever man.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we putting any special lookout for corruption in the
                        CD, the Christian Democrats, or anything like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No. We tracked it, we reported on it, because after all we had that very
                    large political section, and so we did report on it, but we had no particular...
                    We were concerned during the Lockheed scandals because, after all, that was an
                    American company, but we never got involved in that, but we paid attention and
                    we reported it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, maybe this is a good time to stop, I think. Is there
                        anything else we should cover, do you think, in Italy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, the only other thing goes back to the strategic commitment of the
                    Italian Government to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, which is not
                    recognized by a lot of people. I actually again was charg� when the instruction
                    came in to go and talk to the government about the deployment of Cruise missiles
                    on Italian soil, and to my very agreeable surprise, rather than resist the idea,
                    what the government then wanted from us, from Dick Gardner and me, was basically
                    to help them design a campaign that would win over the opposition political
                    parties - the Socialist Party, in particular - and the press. In other words,
                    they wanted our cooperation in doing that, and we gave it to them. We went to
                    see leaders of the Socialist Party to make the strategic argument as to why this
                    was important and what we hoped it would lead to down the road. So I just think
                    it was a particularly revealing vignette about this sort of automatic reaction
                    of an Italian leader of whatever Christians Democratic-dominated government it
                    might be, to work with the United States in their interest but also in Alliance
                    interests. It worked. Very quickly, within a matter of a couple of months, they
                    were able to get that through the parliament. Sure there was opposition - the
                    Communist Party opposed it, sure - but by very astutely following a game plan
                    and talking to all political parties, labor unions, key journalists and
                    publishers, the Italian Government was able to get the assent of the majority of
                    the body politic to this very major deployment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, well the next time we'll pick this up in 1979.
                        You left Italy and you went where.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I went back to Washington. I had hoped that I would be ambassador to
                    Morocco, because I had been nominated to the White House by Secretary Vance, but
                    I was the career candidate, and there was a political candidate who was actually
                    selected. So instead of then going to Morocco, I was asked to come back and be
                    the senior deputy in the European Bureau.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: All right, we'll pick it up at that point. Great.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is May 18, 1999. Allen, in the first place, you were the senior deputy
                    assistant secretary in the European Bureau from when to when?</p>
                <p>HOLMES: Actually from '79 to '82, because I was the continuity deputy that was
                    asked by the incoming Republican Administration. After Reagan won the election,
                    Larry Eagleburger replaced George Vest as Assistant Secretary for European
                    Affairs and asked me to stay on as principal deputy, so I was there pretty much
                    three years.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't you talk about coming back in '79. '79 was a
                        major year of crisis for the Carter Administration and our foreign policy
                        and all that, particularly towards then. I'm talking about the embassy
                        takeover, the invasion of Afghanistan by the Soviets. Things weren't going
                        well. You'd been away. Could you talk about your impression of the Bureau at
                        that time and how it developed, and then we'll talk about some of the
                        issues.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, certainly the takeover of the American embassy in Teheran in
                    November of 1979 - I think it was November the 4th - was... No one at the time
                    realized that this would usher in a period of semi-paralysis in US diplomacy for
                    444 days and that it would lead to a horrible, failed rescue attempt about six
                    months later, when the commando group that had been put together in pretty
                    sloppy fashion... led by a famous commando but it had been put together with
                    insufficient resources, insufficient training, insufficient equipment, a poorly
                    conceived and managed exercise which ended in disaster in the desert with quite
                    a few losses - planes burned and people destroyed. This also led to the
                    resignation of Secretary Vance, who in the very private councils of the
                    government had been strongly opposed to a rescue attempt. During a trip out of
                    Washington, when the issue came up one more time (in fact, there's some evidence
                    that National Security Advisor Brzezinski precipitated the move), the decision
                    was made to go ahead, and Vance was extremely displeased and it caused him to
                    resign his job. Senator Muskie came in and took his place for the remaining
                    year-minus of the Carter Administration. During that time, the deputy secretary,
                    Warren Christopher, had been conducting negotiations through the Algerians for
                    the release of our hostages. So it was a very confusing and rather
                    unsatisfactory period in the context of foreign relations, the one exception
                    being, of course, the heroic, extraordinary, almost single-handed performance by
                    the President in effecting the Camp David Accords, which was an amazing
                    commitment of Presidential prestige and power and ended in a very strong,
                    important result for the future of the Peace Process in the Middle East. But at
                    the same time we were, according to the Republican critics and some critics on
                    the democratic side as well, “giving away” the Panama Canal; the SALT
                    negotiations with the Soviets were going forward, building block in the arms
                    control edifice that would be completed largely in the Reagan Administration. So
                    it was a difficult time. It was a messy time. The Soviets invaded Afghanistan.
                    There was a crisis in Poland involving, of course, Solidarity. There also was
                    the playing out of the crisis over Cyprus. The Turks had some time before
                    invaded Cyprus and had established a separate Cypriot Turkish republic.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, in '74.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0130" n="Page0130"/>
                <p>HOLMES: But the crisis was very much still in effect as far as US interests were
                    concerned because the Congress still had cut off aid to our NATO ally, to
                    Turkey, and the Turks had closed down some of our intelligence stations along
                    their northern border, which had an effect, or course, on our ability to track
                    Soviet missile tests and potentially, in a war involving Israel and its Arab
                    opponents, it could have had an effect on our responsibility for the protection
                    of Israel. So here again, this was a messy period, but was finally solved by a
                    very long negotiation led by the counselor of the State Department, Matt
                    Nimitz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd been in the European Bureau before, hadn't you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, in fact I'd spent most of my career in the European Bureau and had
                    previously been the director of NATO affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you came back, I assume, what, the fall of '79?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: The fall of '79. It was, I believe, September.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You had by this time a nose for these things - how was the
                        bureau working towards the end of the Carter Administration? How did you
                        feel it was operating?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, it was operating in a strange way. The bureau was somewhat
                    dismembered in that, as I recall, Soviet affairs were handled, as I recall,
                    directly out of Secretary Vance's office. Then, as I said, when the final
                    negotiation on the Turkish crisis went into high gear, that was also a
                    Seventh-Floor negotiation conducted by the counselor. I had the feeling, as the
                    senior deputy, that a lot of the work we were doing was basically caretaker
                    work. The principal initiatives of the Carter Administration, other than the
                    arms control negotiations with the Soviets, were other than European issues.
                    Human rights, of course, was a major initiative of the Carter Administration and
                    the setting up of a bureau for human rights and congressional legislation and
                    Andy Young's work on African affairs from his perch at the United Nations, to be
                    working on the South African situation. Middle East negotiations. At some point
                    there was a crisis in our relationship with China. But basically, if you look at
                    the range of foreign policy issues, not a great deal was happening in
                    Europe.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say “Europe,” what are we talking about? The
                        Soviet Union is excluded now. What about Poland?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, Poland - certainly there was a crisis in Poland, and central, or
                    eastern, Europe was still very much a part of the portfolio, and that was
                    handled mostly by the deputy assistant secretary for Russian and East European
                    affairs. That included, obviously, also NATO Europe and southern Europe and
                    Canada and Scandinavia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this time - we're still talking about the Carter
                        years - what was your feeling about how NATO was shaping up at that time?
                        Was it in better shape than it had been, or maybe not as much?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, the very strong initiative, which was initiated by an idea that
                    Helmut Schmidt had and which I discussed in the earlier session we had when I
                    was DCM in Rome had to do with the emplacement of the Pershing IIs and the
                    Cruise missiles, basically the intermediate nuclear weapons, in five European
                    locations, which very much got the attention of the Soviets - particularly the
                    Pershings - and led eventually to a very serious negotiation that ended in the
                    INF treaty. So that was a major initiative, which was not fully realized in
                    terms of the arms control part of it until the Reagan Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As the principal DAS, what was your bailiwick?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I initially handled NATO and northern Europe - I seemed to go to
                    Scandinavia on periodic visits - and Greece-Turkey affairs. That was a cauldron
                    that was always bubbling. It always would, just given the nature of the
                    relationship, but particularly seismic activity as a result of the Cyprus
                    situation.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was the Greek-Turkish thing-</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, the Greek-Turkish thing obviously had an impact on NATO solidarity
                    and a deleterious effect on it, particularly training in the Mediterranean, the
                    southern flank of NATO. But I think, in terms of NATO �lan, that that was offset
                    by the INF negotiations, which the allies were very committed to. Initially, of
                    course, to the deployment and the training, setting up that whole system and the
                    training that accompanied it, had a strong leadership effect on the alliance,
                    and that was an important chapter. Q: In dealing with this, the introduction of
                    intermediate missiles in order to counter the Soviets - this is sort of a NATO
                    thing. What about the French? I mean, I can't see the French just sitting back
                    and saying, “Well, that's all your problem,” and not getting involved.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: The French were not involved in that effort. Of course, they were no
                    longer members of the integrated military structure of NATO at that point, and
                    they were very busy building their own force de frappe, their own suite of
                    nuclear weapons from tactical to strategic weapons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They weren't sort of a problem. They were really out of
                        this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, the French at the time could always be counted on to give their own
                    view, which frequently was at variance with the rest of the Alliance. People
                    were used to that. I don't remember them playing a particularly obstructionist
                    role in terms of carrying out the INF strategy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why was the Soviet Union moved up to the Secretary's
                        suite, because when you talk about you had a crisis in Poland, but the
                        crisis in Poland also impacted very heavily on what the Soviet Union was
                        going to do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I'm not really clear on that, because that basically had happened or had
                    already been decided by the time I returned to Washington in September, '79. It
                    may have had to do with the fact that Secretary Vance, with long experience in
                    arms control, was involved in the SALT II negotiations and this was considered
                    by him - certainly by many - to be the most important enterprise we had going
                    with the Soviets, and therefore he wanted the portfolio under his immediate
                    supervision.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the NATO reaction to the Soviet invasion of
                        Afghanistan in December of 1979? I mean, this was an offensive move
                        basically.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I think the NATO reaction was a strongly adverse reaction to this
                    move. It was seen at the time for what it was, which was a classic
                    Soviet-arranged coup. Their invasion had been preceded by careful infiltration
                    of Soviet agents, the identification and training and of puppet leaders that
                    they could control, the installation of their own Afghan. That, of course, then
                    eventually led to the invasion. We, of course, sought a vote of condemnation in
                    the UN Security Council, took various measures against the Soviets, of course to
                    no avail. They were embarked on this course and would be involved in Afghanistan
                    for some time to come after that. I think everybody in the Alliance - there was
                    no disagreement as to what was happening here and to what strong position of
                    opposition the Alliance should take in the matter. But it had no particular
                    effect.</p>
                <p>About that time - I can't remember the exact date - our ambassador, Spike Dubs,
                    was assassinated.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: It was in that period. Of course, that had a strong emotional reaction
                    within the ranks of the Foreign Service, because Spike Dubs was an extremely
                    popular and admired senior Foreign Service officer.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: I don't even remember much of an effort except, of course, we did get

                        Department of State have a divergent policy towards particularly western
                        Europe or even eastern Europe than had been under the Carter Administration?
                        Was that apparent?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0134" n="Page0134"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, definitely. First of all, at the beginning of the Reagan
                    Administration General Al Haig was appointed as the Secretary of State, and he
                    had, of course, great experience in Europe, and Larry Eagleburger was brought in
                    as the assistant secretary for European affairs, and there was a desire in the
                    aftermath of the 444 days of the hostage crisis to reestablish vigorous US
                    diplomatic leadership in the alliance and in the world in general. The attitude
                    of the incoming Administration was that the Carter Administration had let our
                    military power decline, wither, although in fact, at the tail end of the Carter
                    Administration, there was a deliberate attempt to start the rebuilding process
                    at least of our military strength. But the Reagan Administration came in with a
                    sense of mission that this was badly needed, that we had to build up our
                    military force, reestablish strong US leadership worldwide and particularly in
                    the Atlantic Alliance, and stand up to the Soviet Union. The first year or two
                    of the Reagan Administration, the Defense Department's budget increased a
                    tremendous amount, and under the leadership of Secretary Weinberger there was a
                    tremendous rebuilding process that took place of the armed forces. So there was
                    a much more, I would say, muscular approach to foreign policy than what we had
                    seen previously. One of the first things that Haig wanted to do, Haig and the
                    President, was to, of course, reestablish relations with our principal allies. I
                    don't know if I covered this in an earlier period or not, but the first visit to
                    Europe was made by the Vice President, by George Bush, on behalf of the
                    President and the new Administration. It was about March, as I recall, of 1981.
                    I think I did cover this in an earlier session.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We can always edit, so don't worry.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Larry Eagleburger was very involved in a number of projects with the
                    Secretary, and he asked me to represent the Department on the visit to Europe
                    with the Vice President. We went to two places, basically. It was a very short
                    visit. We went first to Paris to meet with Fran�ois Mitterrand, and we arrived
                    for lunch with Mitterrand the day that the first cabinet meeting, which included
                    Communists for the first time in the French Government, had just taken place, so
                    there was a great deal of discussion at that time about Mitterrand's plans. As
                    you can imagine, great skepticism and concern on the part of the Reagan
                    Administration over what Mitterrand's move meant in terms of Western interests
                    and Alliance solidarity - since, after all, France was still a member of the
                    North Atlantic Treaty Organization, although absent from the military structure.
                    So there was a great deal of discussion there, with Mitterrand explaining his
                    policy of “suffocating” the Communists by embracing them in the government. By
                    the end of this long discussion, Bush beginning to see that this was at least a
                    deliberate policy on the part of the French Government and that it just might
                    work. I had advised the Vice President to explain to Mitterrand that it would be
                    necessary, in his short press encounter, to say something “disobliging” about
                    the inclusion of French Communists in the government with an eye to the Italian
                    situation, which was developing, always on the verge of the famous historic
                    compromise between the Italian Communists and the Christian Democrats.</p>
                <pb facs="0135" n="Page0135"/>
                <p>Anyway, that was done, and then we flew to London immediately thereafter and had
                    dinner at 10 Downing Street with Mrs. Thatcher, and that was an extremely
                    interesting evening, with Mrs. Thatcher basically “covering the waterfront” of
                    global problems. This was her first serious attempt to establish this special
                    relationship with the incoming Administration, and it was a very easy
                    conversation with very easy confluence of views on the various problems that we
                    faced around the world. I remember one amusing incident at the end of the
                    dinner. Mrs. Thatcher took us to the cabinet room. 10 Downing Street is
                    basically about three townhouses interconnected. We went into the cabinet room,
                    and the foreign secretary at the time was Lord Peter Carrington, whom I had
                    known some from my NATO days, when he had been secretary general of NATO. We
                    went into the cabinet room, where Lord Carrington said this is the room where
                    the United States had gained its independence. There was a pause, and then I
                    piped up and said that I was surprised. I had thought that that happened at
                    Yorktown. That caused a moment of silence, and then a lot of laughter.</p>

                        eyes, had let him down badly over the neutron bomb and all this, and I was
                        wondering whether you were looking towards trying, in your capacity and the
                        bureau's capacity, to repair relations with Germany and with the
                        chancellor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, that was certainly something that the incoming Republican
                    Administration worked at. There had been a feeling of letdown. I do recall,
                    during the tail-end of the Carter Administration, from my perch in Washington in
                    the European Bureau, the extraordinary effort - I thought extraordinary
                    commitment of time on the part of a chief executive, of a President - to his
                    correspondence. He must have realized, he did realize that he had a difficult
                    relationship there, and we would send over a draft letter - and this happened
                    several times - and Carter was famous for getting up very early in the morning
                    and working before the rest of the White House staff was awake, and during the
                    night, this draft letter had come over, and he would sit and work on it, rework
                    it and send it back to the Department, to our bureau. It was quite extraordinary
                    to see how much time the President spent shaping, frequently more stylistically
                    than substantively, his correspondence with major leaders, particularly - I just
                    remembered that his correspondence with Schmidt was somewhat tortured.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When the Reagan Administration came in, you had a
                        Secretary of State who had been the supreme commander of NATO, so he knew it
                        backwards and forwards. Did you feel that maybe now was the time to do
                        something about shoring up some of the places and taking initiatives,
                        particularly with Western Europe, that hadn't happened under the Carter
                        Administration, who had priorities outside of Europe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, certainly, I would say that from the time that Al Haig was
                    Secretary of State, the most successful part of his stewardship of American
                    foreign policy was with the threat to Europe, because he built on the rather
                    extraordinary set of relationships that he had cultivated in Europe, and that
                    was of great benefit to the Reagan Administration, and that was one of the
                    reasons for his selection, which surprised a lot of people, as Secretary of
                    State. Don't forget, Reagan had a very strong view - in fact, I would say,
                    almost a major force line in his foreign policy was to basically overpower the
                    Soviet Union in terms of our own strategic planning. You will remember the
                    speeches he made referring to it as the “Evil Empire,” and his major concern was
                    to rebuild American military strength and then, basically, George Shultz later
                    convinced him to use that strength as the basis for a very vigorous set of arms
                    control negotiations, which then happened. But he was largely concerned with
                    first matching Soviet military strength, rebuilding our own military strength,
                    and then reestablishing a dominant American diplomatic position vis-�-vis the
                    Soviet Union in the world. That meant, as a necessary platform for that effort,
                    that NATO should be rebuilt and that the US position within the Alliance should
                    be unassailable. That, I think, was one of the major reasons for appointing Al
                    Haig, this extremely successful supreme allied commander, as the Secretary. He
                    worked on that, he used that, very successfully in rebuilding the entire set of
                    relationships with the allies.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were in the European Bureau, did you

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, we did see that. There was really almost a symbiotic relationship in
                    terms of views. Both were strong conservatives with a similar view of the
                    marketplace as well, of course, as standing up to the Soviet Union and ensuring
                    that the West's positions on- (end of tape)</p>

                        in the National Security Council he said that they always got nervous and
                        tried to do everything they could to keep Ronald Reagan and Margaret
                        Thatcher from being alone in a room. This was also with Brian Mulroney, the
                        prime minister of Canada, because Reagan warmed to these two people so much
                        that they were afraid he would make commitments that they wished he
                        hadn't.</hi>

                <p>What about with Germany? Was Ronald Reagan able to establish a rapport with

                <p>HOLMES: Yes, I think it was a difficult relationship. Schmidt, of course, knew a
                    lot of Americans, and he was a very accomplished financial economist. Really,
                    after Haig's departures and George Shultz's arrival, the US-German relationship
                    improved. Shultz had been Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

                    meetings, in the annual Bank and Fund meetings, basically two finance ministers
                    talking together, and so that made very big difference when Shultz came in. I
                    remember that he always made a very personal effort to build that relationship
                    with Schmidt, having him to his house for an informal barbecue or breakfast -
                    not the official kind of entertainment that a Secretary of State would normally
                    do. So that made a big difference.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you get involved in the gas line controversy, or did
                        that come up during your watch? This was when Ronald Reagan wanted to stop a

                <p>HOLMES: Yes, I remember the incident. I personally didn't get involved in that.Q:

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes. It may have been a little later. In European affairs
                        during the Reagan Administration, while they were sort of getting to know
                        each other, were there any issues that came up that you got involved with
                        particularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, of course, this was the beginning part. Reagan was in office for
                    eight years, and I was in Washington for the initial period with Larry
                    Eagleburger. Larry subsequently was promoted to undersecretary for political
                    affairs, left the bureau in my hands for probably three-quarters of the year,
                    and at the same time, he and Walt Stoessel proposed me as ambassador to
                    Portugal. So towards the end of that period I was in transition, and about the
                    time that I went off to Portugal as ambassador in early September 1982, Shultz
                    had just recently come on board as Secretary and had replaced Haig.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So there was quite a bit of turmoil there.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0138" n="Page0138"/>
                <p>HOLMES: There was a certain amount of turmoil at that time. I think probably the
                    departure of Haig was largely the result of his acquiescence in if not
                    encouragement of the Israeli entry into Lebanon and in Beirut. I guess it was
                    during that period that Haig was replaced by Shultz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you getting any signs of the White House staff being
                        at odds with Haig? Haig had been a White House operator, but one has the
                        feeling that the people around Reagan really didn't care for Haig.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, that was certainly true when... It had been noticeable for a while,
                    but then, of course, it all came into focus when the assassination attempt
                    against Reagan [took place] and Haig rushed to the White House, announced on
                    television that everyone should relax, that he was in charge. That convinced a
                    lot of his detractors they had reason for-</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0139" n="Page0139"/>
                <p>HOLMES: I was in Portugal from '82 to '85, and that was a wonderful assignment,
                    to be a chief of mission in Europe. As a Europeanist and having served almost
                    entirely my career in the European Bureau, this was a great assignment, because
                    there was a lot going on, and it wasn't your sort of classic middle-sized
                    European ambassadorship that would be left for career officers once the big
                    posts were distributed to large party contributors. Portugal was a wonderful
                    assignment because it was sort of the soft, underdeveloped belly of Europe, if I
                    might paraphrase Churchill. When I got to Portugal I know it had a per capita
                    GNP of $1800, which made it the poorest country in Europe other than Turkey. It
                    was poorer than Greece, which was saying something. It had a deficit of over $3
                    billion on current account, and in our embassy there - it was an embassy of over
                    100 people - we had an AID mission and a MAG, a military advisory group, there.
                    It was a fascinating time to be there, and there was an opportunity there to
                    participate in economic development as well as the more classic diplomacy that
                    one usually conducts in a NATO capital. About that time, our base rights
                    agreement was running out of time, and we had to renegotiate our agreement that
                    governed our presence in the Azores, so there was a lot of discussion in
                    Washington about having a separate negotiator for that. But I argued that the
                    base rights were so central to our relationship with Portugal that I felt that I
                    wouldn't really be fully in charge of US-Portuguese relations if somebody else
                    conducted negotiations. I'd had a lot of political-military experience, so I
                    pretty much insisted that I should do it, and did, in fact, conduct the
                    negotiations, which went on for some time. We even had one government - not as a
                    result of the basic negotiations, but I lost a negotiating partner for a while,
                    while the Portuguese Government reestablished itself. Basically, I was
                    conducting three negotiations simultaneously. One was the political negotiation
                    that governed our presence there. Then there was the military. The military base
                    rights agreement that undergirded the political presence, if you will, hadn't
                    been revised in something like 15 years. It was badly out of date, as was the
                    labor agreement for the Portuguese workforce at our base in the Azores. So we
                    basically had three concentric circles, negotiations going on. I had a very good
                    team from the Pentagon that came and worked with me, and I had the good fortune
                    to have as my counterpart a wonderful Portuguese diplomat, Calvet de Magalhaes -
                    very experienced older diplomat who came out of retirement to do this
                    negotiation. We had a sort of an understanding of what the shape of this
                    negotiation should be. We never quite articulated it to each other, but each
                    understood that our views were convergent. We often afterwards would regale
                    ourselves with stories about whether he or I was more an object of suspicion of
                    our respective military establishments. There was a lot of play behind the
                    scenes in Portugal between the General Staff, who really were trying to get much
                    more payoff for reestablishing our base rights than we were prepared to give. He
                    was difficult. It was also difficult in the sense that in Washington in the
                    Department there was an undersecretary for security assistance who basically
                    wanted to dole out the funding that was available to conclude this negotiation
                    on a month-by-month basis. I went back on consultation and went to see Larry
                    Eagleburger, who was then undersecretary. I said that I could not conduct a
                    negotiation without having all the cards in my hand. He said he would have to
                    have an NSC meeting about it, but not to worry that it would turn out the right
                    way, and it did. So I had a certain amount of money available for military
                    assistance and economic assistance for Portugal. I came back and I tucked about
                    $50 million in my back pocket as my strategic reserve. Then I went to Calvet de
                    Magalhaes and told him that I had come back with a pretty good set of
                    instructions and that in my next meeting with the foreign minister I would tell
                    him what I had. But I wanted Calvet de Magalhaes to know that I had a reserve
                    fund (which was not the reserve fund that I had pocketed but a second reserve
                    fund that I wanted him to know about), so that at a certain point he could be
                    the hero and deliver the Americans. It worked very well, except that when I
                    invited Secretary Shultz to come to Portugal to do two things on the same visit
                    - one, to inaugurate our new embassy and to sign the base rights agreement - we
                    weren't quite finished, because the Portuguese General Staff was still holding
                    out unrealistically for more than we were prepared to give them. So when Shultz
                    arrived, the political agreement was completed, but the military base rights
                    part of the agreement was not completed. I wanted - and Shultz agreed with me -
                    to have it all tied into a package and done at the same time. So there was a
                    gala dinner that night, and my wife, Marilyn, and I went up and had drinks with
                    the Shultzes in their hotel suite and we talked about the toast that he would
                    give at the dinner, because the military folks were still negotiating as we were
                    there having a drink. He said, “Well, I'm not going to use all of this airy,
                    good-fellowship, bonhomie kind of material because we haven't concluded the
                    negotiations, and I think we could stay away from it, just as a kind of a signal
                    to the Portuguese that we're not going celebrate something until it's done all
                    the way.” I had told him about my strategic reserve, and he used it in his
                    meeting with the vice prime minister. He alluded to it. We went off to the
                    dinner, and Shultz was prepared to talk about the age of exploration and the
                    Portuguese Cabrillo who founded California, where he came from, and so forth. As
                    we were sitting down to dinner, at the end of this large banquet hall I could
                    see the US Navy captain who was my negotiator walked in the room and gave me a
                    thumbs up. So I quickly told Shultz that the deal was done, that we had our
                    agreement, and we could go forward with it. So that was it. It was a very
                    interesting brinkmanship act, and it turned out very well. It was a very good
                    agreement. Shultz inaugurated our new embassy, and I was very pleased. This had
                    taken a while, because I got there in September of 82, and we didn't really
                    finish it until well into the following year.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It seems like base negotiations of the Azores are
                        something that are sort of an ongoing thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: The Azores base was very important to us during the Cold War because of
                    the tracking of Soviet missile submarines, strategic submarines, throughout the
                    Atlantic, and there was a whole network. We had the underwater arrays and then
                    the P-3 aircraft that were dropping sonar buoys and flying out of Keflavik,
                    Iceland, and all the way down to the Azores to track these Soviet subs as they
                    came out of the Bering Sea and moved down through the North Atlantic within
                    range of the United States. It was a very important mission to track them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was it basically implicit on both sides that it would be
                        hard negotiating but you basically - both the Portuguese and the United
                        States - were going to end up with agreement?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, that was certainly understood, but the Portuguese had a very curious
                    maddening style of negotiating. Sessions were never angry. When they were not
                    prepared to move further on a particular point, they would just go dead-weight
                    on you. It was like moving bags of cement - always in a very quiet polite way,
                    but they just wouldn't budge. So the danger was that an unsatisfactory,
                    unresolved situation could go on for months if not for years because it was
                    relatively easy just to roll our rights forward another six months or another
                    year. So that was the problem. We wanted to get it done and just not have this
                    kind of hanging over our heads. We also, for the first time, negotiated a
                    presence on the mainland, which was basically part of an array of telescopes we
                    had in five locations around the world. I remember the acronym: it was GEODES.
                    It was an optical tracking station, basically. We had a couple in the United
                    States; we had one in Korea. This was to be the fifth of these tracking
                    stations, which basically tracked objects in space and allowed SPACECOM in
                    Colorado to keep track of seven or eight different space objects, everything
                    from space stations to space junk to meteorites, and they had them all plotted
                    because of this array of telescopes around the world. So this was kind of a new
                    venture.</p>
                <pb facs="0141" n="Page0141"/>
                <p>I think our relationship was strengthened a lot with the Portuguese in that
                    period, also because they were very helpful to us. Mario Soares, who was prime
                    minister during most of the time I was there, was leader of the opposition when
                    I arrived. He was the kind of father figure of modern Portugal. He had been in
                    exile for many years during the Salazar years, was a leader of the Socialist
                    Party, was one of the great figures in Europe and was our friend. He was very
                    intent on helping us, since we wanted to reopen the door to southern Africa, to
                    Mozambique and Angola, which had been pushed away from any kind of a
                    relationship with the United States during the Kissinger years. Chet Crocker,
                    who was assistant secretary for African affairs in the Department at that time,
                    and Frank Wisner, his deputy, were very intent on using the Portuguese to open a
                    door to those countries in southern Africa so that we could begin to negotiate a
                    new relationship with both of those countries. We had talks about that, and
                    Soares was very helpful in that regard, because of course, having been the
                    person who came in after the Revolution of the Carnations in April of 1974 and
                    basically quickly moved to dissolve the remnants of the Portuguese colonial
                    empire, he had a very strong reputation in those countries. Under his government
                    it was possible to get access to Mozambican and Angolan leaders who otherwise
                    were not particularly hospitable to the US Government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you work this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Frank Wisner made quite a few trips to Portugal, and we would go and talk
                    to the foreign minister, and Frank would lay out, basically, US strategy, which
                    culminated in a number of accords that Chet Crocker and Frank negotiated in
                    southern Africa. But basically, at the beginning of this process, the conduit
                    was through Lisbon, and then once the doors were opened and the relationships
                    established, then we would keep the Portuguese informed, obviously, as to what
                    was going on, but it was just in the initial period that the door to southern
                    Africa was opened in Lisbon.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Portugal as a NATO ally? HOLMES: Yes, that's an
                        interesting question, because for the 13 some years of the Portuguese
                        colonial war, which was one of these hopeless ventures, they wasted their
                        scarce military and defense resources on this war, and by the end of the war
                        they really had very little to contribute to NATO, in terms of the whole
                        defense planning process. One of the things that Frank Carlucci had done as
                        the ambassador that came in right after the revolution and helped pull the
                        democratic leaders together to avoid a Communist takeover - because the last
                        reaming Stalinist party in Europe was in Portugal. One of the things that
                        Frank did with the security funds that he got out of Washington was to help
                        recreate a sense that Portugal was part of NATO, that its forces should
                        modernize and be committed to NATO, train with NATO forces. The idea was to
                        give them a western European NATO mission and turn their backs on Africa,
                        and it was also a way of absorbing a lot of young military who otherwise
                        would have been tempted to participate in revolutionary coup-making activity
                        if left to sort of slosh around in Portugal at the time. So we were well
                        embarked on the program that Frank Carlucci had started of modernizing the
                        Portuguese armed forces. I had a long negotiation - and I had some help from
                        Frank, who was then deputy secretary of Defense and came to visit us in
                        Portugal about two weeks after we arrived. I met more people thanks to him
                        in three days than I would have in three months. But we got some very good
                        deals through them. I think they were A-7s, if I recall. They were surplus
                        A-7s which were refurbished in the United States and became the P-74s. We
                        got a very good price for the Portuguese, and they had a very good... Lemos
                        Ferreira - I remember him - he was the chief of staff of the Portuguese Air
                        Force, American-trained pilot, part of that generation of people that had
                        done their training in the United States and had a very strong feeling for
                        the United States. He was very pleased to get these aircraft, and they had a
                        very good facility, quite modern. This was an aircraft repair facility
                        outside of Lisbon. They had been able to build a modern facility thanks to
                        money that they received from the Germans for the joint use, had there been
                        a war, of a base at a place called Beija. So, not only were they in a
                        position to maintain these aircraft, but also to maintain other aircraft and
                        to service other aircraft that were in the American inventory. We worked a
                        deal for some aircraft that were stationed in Europe to receive depot
                        maintenance at this Portuguese facility, which kind of added to the
                        development of their fledgling aeronautical industry. There were some things
                        like that that were done and then building up two brigades that in the even
                        of a war would fight with Italian forces, and then in addition giving them a
                        certain amount of equipment, navigation and armament, to modernize their
                        very old destroyers so they could play some role in the Atlantic. Portugal
                        is a Triangular country. There's the mainland, the Azores, and Madeira, and
                        there's a NATO reserve air base on Madeira. So they had a national reason
                        for having ships, and they of course had an ancient maritime tradition. It
                        was very curious. When I first got to Portugal, to show you how high the
                        Pyrenees were, 90 percent of Portuguese exports going to other parts of
                        Western Europe went by sea, which is kind of emblematic of their reliance on
                        the sea, and they always looked outward to the Atlantic. It was Mario Soares
                        who started almost as one man to force the Portuguese to start thinking
                        about joining the European Community. He eventually accomplished it shortly
                        after I left there.</hi>

                <p>HOLMES: It had an Atlantic vocation, always had been, and an African. Of course,

                    assignment in Africa, Cameroon, derives from the Portuguese word for shrimp,
                    camer�es, because when the Portuguese navigators went there, they saw shrimp
                    jumping in the Wouri River, and ergo the name.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: So they had this long maritime tradition; they had this Atlantic
                    vocation; the Portuguese had always had an Atlantic sponsor, a special ally. For
                    many years it had been the British - from 1385 and basically until the end of
                    World War II - and then we became their sort of protector and sponsor. It was an
                    astonishing... You know about the Treaty of Windsor, between Portugal and the

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: It's the oldest, long-running defense treaty in history, from 1385 to the
                    present. There was a famous battle where the English sent longbowmen that turned
                    the tide against the Spanish knights, and they had all kinds of sweetheart
                    business deals over the years, and we were able to operate a base out of the
                    Azores by the middle of World War II because Churchill leaned on Salazar, who
                    was neutral, reminding him of the Treaty of Windsor. He kept insisting, and
                    eventually we got in there and were able to use that very successfully against
                    the German U-boat menace. Then we piggy-backed on that, and that's how we got
                    the Azores at the end of the war. They still invoked the Treaty of Windsor, the
                    British did, to stage tankers out of Madeira to refuel the Vulcan bombers on the
                    way down to the Falklands to crater the runways. Once again, they invoked the
                    Treaty of Windsor - quite astonishing.</p>

                <pb facs="0144" n="Page0144"/>
                <p>HOLMES: They played some role, I would say. It was very clear that particularly
                    in Barney Frank's constituency in and around Norton, Massachusetts, was heavily
                    Portuguese-American and Azorean-American. The only Portuguese-American member of
                    Congress is Tony Coelho, who is from California and a very minor
                    Portuguese-American implantation in his district. But he came to visit me, and
                    he took that very seriously. But I did use that at a certain point where, during
                    our base negotiations the Department, again this undersecretary for security
                    assistance tried to cut back the money that had been, I thought, fenced for the
                    Portuguese negotiations. Knowing that I would get nowhere with this individual,
                    I came back to Washington and made some visits on the Hill, and I went to see
                    Barney Frank and told him about it. It was an amazing visit. I spent 45 minutes
                    in Barney Frank's office. While I was there, he phoned about 10 members of
                    Congress to get their support for retaining the promised moneys for Portuguese
                    assistance, and then he said, “I have to go and vote. Come with me. We might
                    catch a few more on the way.” Sure enough, in the elevator, we caught two more
                    members of Congress. This resulted in a letter from the Speaker to the Secretary
                    of State - without reference to me - I was not mentioned, fortunately, because I
                    was really being quite naughty. I had told the Department none of this. I just
                    went straight to where the money was. This was a very strongly worded letter,
                    and the Secretary turned to Larry Eagleburger apparently in a meeting and said,
                    “Where is this pressure coming from?” Larry had an inkling. But it made the
                    difference. The money that they had hived off of the fenced money for Portugal
                    was restored. So in that instance, the Portuguese-American constituency
                    helped.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about relations with Spain at that time? How were
                        things working there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: The Portuguese and the Spanish had a curious relationship. It was a
                    little easier later, when their Felipe Gonz�lez became prime minister and Mario
                    Soares was prime minister, but the Portuguese and the Spanish always had a
                    quarrelsome, difficult relationship. They quarreled about fishing rights. The
                    Portuguese, basically from a very early period, from the 12th or 13th century,
                    had defined themselves against the Spanish. They really had a common language.
                    Portuguese and Spanish are very close, but they worked very hard and
                    successfully at establishing a very separate identity. Whereas the Spanish are
                    much more Latin, much more outgoing, the Portuguese are more quiet, even dour.
                    They're almost more Celtic than Latin, and the way they do things is different.
                    I mean in Portuguese bullfighting, for example, they don't kill the bull. I
                    mean, it's representative of their way of doing things. The Portuguese
                    revolution - there were fewer than 10 people that were killed in the Portuguese
                    revolution. It was quite extraordinary, to give up an entire empire and turn
                    that country inside out, bringing on whole new... and a very hard-line Communist
                    Party - they call it the Revolution of the Carnations. The soldiers went around
                    the streets of Lisbon with carnations stuck in their barrels. The Portuguese
                    temperament is entirely different from the Spanish.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find, when you were there, dealing with the
                        Portuguese Government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0145" n="Page0145"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Dealing with the Portuguese Government was an interesting experience for
                    me because I worked very, very hard at playing down the proconsular role. The
                    American ambassador in Portugal was a figure and was somebody that... I had the
                    most extraordinarily easy access to every member of the government. No door was
                    closed to me. The prime minister, Mario Soares, was very kind to me in
                    opposition when I first arrived there, and he would invite my wife and me over
                    to their small apartment for Sunday lunch, so I knew him a fair amount by the
                    time he came into office. But my relationship with him was such that every month
                    or so he would invite me over for lunch to his office, the prime minister's
                    office, and they'd put screens up in his large office and just the two of us
                    would sit at a table and eat bacalhao stew, which he loved, and they put these
                    curtains up so that they wouldn't see that he was violating his wife's diet.
                    This is very rich food. But we had an extraordinarily good relationship.</p>
                <p>I can remember, for example, when we went into Grenada. We had a night-action
                    message that came into all NATO capitals to go in and get support. I got an
                    immediate appointment with him at seven o'clock the next morning. I got his
                    agreement, his support. I asked him if we could say so. He said, “Yes, you may.”
                    I went back, and he was the only NATO ally that immediately supported the United
                    States. I guess the British did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, the British were kind of unhappy about this.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: They were unhappy about it, and afterwards, Soares regretted it a little
                    bit because he had a little bit of a problem with his NATO allies that he had so
                    easily acceded, but it was sort of a natural thing. Great access.</p>
                <pb facs="0146" n="Page0146"/>
                <p>But I worked very hard at playing down this proconsular role, and it all came
                    into focus in a major way towards the end of my time in Portugal, based on the
                    suggestion of the AID chief, which was a very good idea. We could see that the
                    aid to Portugal was being frittered away, and we were drawing down. It was
                    becoming increasingly clear that having an AID mission there was no longer
                    necessary and that Congress would not continue to support this. So we decided to
                    propose the establishment of a foundation which would be capitalized with the
                    ESF and some of the military security assistance funds, and it was capitalized
                    $100 million. A private foundation of public interest, it was called. It was
                    called that way so as to get around certain taxes that the Ministry of Finance
                    wanted to impose. It was established as the Luso-American Foundation for the
                    Cultural, Economic, and Educational Development of Portugal. The Portuguese
                    Government loved the idea, but the most difficult thing was to persuade the
                    Portuguese that the three-man directive committee, that there would be two
                    Portuguese and one American; they wanted to have two Americans and one
                    Portuguese. I said, no, there have to be two Portuguese so that you can outvote
                    me. I think it's very important. This is your foundation, it's your destiny, and
                    it's important that you can outvote the American ambassador. It was a struggle.
                    Their instinct was to stay locked into this very special relationship with the
                    United States. I said, “Look, you're going into the Common Market. You will
                    always have a relationship with the United States and the United Kingdom and
                    this Atlantic vocation, but you will be increasingly moving into the European
                    framework.” I just thought it was important that when push came to shove they
                    could outvote the American member of the committee. That's the way it turned
                    out.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find socialist ties? I'm thinking of European
                        socialist ties, because they played a role when Frank Carlucci was working
                        to try to turn things around in Portugal in the early days after the
                        revolution. You had France under Mitterrand. I'm not sure whether Germany
                        had a socialist government or not. You certainly had Sweden socialist.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, Olaf Palme. There was a very close relationship. Soares had, from
                    his years in exile - that is, when he wasn't in a Portuguese jail - enormous
                    entr�e with the world socialist movement. I mean, the Labor Party in Israel,
                    Olaf Palme, as I said, later on Felipe Gonz�lez in Spain, French Socialists -
                    Soares was a major figure and had close relationships. By the way, he spoke
                    excellent French, and that was his sort of big second language. I think they
                    were helpful, but it's misleading in a way, because some socialist parties in
                    Europe were much more to the left than was the case in Portugal. If you look at
                    a classic political spectrum of parties, whereas yes, the Socialist Party of
                    Portugal had the Communist Party to its left and there was a Social Democratic
                    Party to its right, in fact, on issues from an ideological point of view, the
                    Socialist Party of Portugal was much more like social democracy in your average
                    European country, rather than a more doctrinaire socialist kind of party.</p>

                <pb facs="0147" n="Page0147"/>
                <p>HOLMES: No, no. They were very clearly a social-democratic party, and the Social
                    Democrats in Portugal were more centrist or center-right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Communists? Did you have much dealing with
                        them?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I had no dealing with the Communists. They didn't want to have any
                    dealings with us. Cunhal, who was the long-time head of the Portuguese Communist
                    Party, was a hard-line, ultra-loyal Stalinist who had spent a lot of time in the
                    Soviet Union and I think at one point even had traveled on a Soviet passport. He
                    thoroughly disapproved of what we were doing and didn't like us one bit. But he
                    was almost an abstraction in the sense that, yes, he was Portuguese, but I'm
                    told that even today the Communist Party of Portugal has not changed its name.
                    It's still the Communist Party. It gets smaller and smaller; every time there's
                    an election they go from 15 percent to 12 percent down to nine. Probably before
                    long it will be down to seven percent. But he still talks about restoring the
                    Soviet Union and the dominance of the Communist Party in Russia. So he's caught
                    in a kind of a time-warp today and behaved a little bit that way during the time
                    that I was there. But he was highly regarded by the Soviet Union, and they were
                    always very careful to send important visitors, to invite him and other members
                    to various meetings in Moscow. It was a little implantation.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was no attempt within the Communist Party there to

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, absolutely not. As a matter of fact, although there were maybe a few
                    members who would have liked to do that, who were in contact with their brethren
                    in Italy and in Spain, they would be quickly squashed by Cunhal, who was
                    absolutely true-blue.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: Well, it did in a way. As I say, we had no particular contact. Of course,
                    they lost no opportunity in their newspaper to criticize us for just about
                    everything that they could, but every once in a while I would be at a function
                    and I would meet Cunhal, and I would be polite with him and shake his hand and
                    chat with him. But he wasn't interested in prolonging conversations that we had.
                    At that time I spoke fluent Portuguese, so it was not a question that there was
                    a language barrier.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the media? How did you find the media
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0148" n="Page0148"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I never could understand how a country that was as poor as Portugal
                    could have so many newspapers. It was amazing. They had 12 or 14 daily
                    newspapers there. I can't remember the exact numbers, but it was
                    disproportionate, certainly, to the readership, and it was just quite
                    extraordinary. The paper of record, the sort of New York Times, if you will, was
                    O Diario. That was their big paper, and very highly intelligent breed of
                    journalists in Portugal, very intelligent, very well educated, very familiar
                    with politics in the rest of Europe and to some degree with the United States. I
                    would occasionally give an interview and talk about various issues with them. O
                    Diario had a lot of fun with me. After the Shultz visit, after we closed the
                    base agreement and opened our wonderful new embassy, the following day there was
                    a long-scheduled meeting where I was the speaker at the Portuguese-American
                    business council. I'm not summoning up the correct name, but it was basically a
                    commercial Portuguese-American business association, and I was the speaker. It
                    was more heavily attended than usual, I think because we had concluded this base
                    negotiation and so forth. I gave my speech, and at the end, they asked if there
                    could be a question and answer period, and I said sure. I looked around the
                    room, and I couldn't see any press present. There didn't seem to be anybody
                    present, so I felt a little bit more relaxed about answering the questions, and
                    one guy got up and said, “Tell me what it was like negotiating with the
                    Portuguese Government for this base agreement.” So I looked around, didn't see
                    anybody, and I made the gesture - I pulled my pockets inside out, literally, I
                    just pulled them out. That brought the house down, but also there was a
                    photographer that popped up underneath this platform and caught that picture
                    with my pockets hanging out and everybody laughing - and I was laughing too.
                    That picture plagued me for the rest of my time in Portugal. It was on the front
                    page of O Diario the next day. It was the photograph of the week, the photograph
                    of the month, and then the photograph of the year. I couldn't get away from it.
                    But you know something? That picture did a lot for our relationship, because the
                    feeling was, the American ambassador with this gesture was saying, you know,
                    that the wily, smart Portuguese negotiators took the United States to the
                    cleaners.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Which really wasn't true. It was partially true, in a way; I mean they
                    got more probably... But it really did a lot for the relationship. It sort of
                    titillated their sense of their amour propre.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We talked at great length about this when you were in
                        France. What about power centers? Was there an intelligentsia, think tank,
                        writers? How did you deal with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0149" n="Page0149"/>
                <p>HOLMES: They did. There was a literary society, and there was a strategic studies
                    center and a very active university community which peopled those organizations,
                    they and the politicians - not only the University of Lisbon but probably the
                    oldest university certainly in Portugal and one of the two or three oldest in
                    Europe other than Bologna was in Coimbra. I went to all these places, and I was
                    invited to give speeches, to be on panels, and I did that. I enjoyed that. That
                    was very much, I thought, an important part of my job, sort of outreach to the
                    academic community. We would talk about policy issues. But I did find that, yes,
                    - other than the strategic studies institute (and again I can't remember the
                    exact name of the organization) where I remember giving a long speech about arms
                    control and our strategic relationship within NATO and our negotiations with the
                    Soviet Union that was heavily attended and was kind of a global, big-picture
                    kind of discussion - inevitably in interviews and in universities, the
                    questioning tended to become very quickly local - maybe Iberian, but not as much
                    discussion about Portugal entering the European Community as I would have
                    thought. That was part of Mario Soares's problem, too. For a long time he was a
                    committee of one in just driving this issue, because people just weren't
                    interested.</p>
                <p>The Portuguese were very curious about the way they conducted their lives. Most
                    Portuguese were not ambitious people. Greed was not a factor. If somebody set up
                    a small company to make a widget and it was successful and they got enough money
                    to pay the mortgage off on the house and have a nice vacation and then come up
                    with a profit at the end of the year, instead of plowing that money back into
                    the company and maybe borrowing a little bit more and expanding their industry,
                    they would just stay where they were because they were comfortable. Obviously
                    there are Portuguese entrepreneurs, and I don't want to exaggerate this point,
                    but they had a very kind of a comfortable neighborhood approach to life, very
                    sweet people, very courteous.. It's the only place I've ever been where if you
                    asked directions someplace they'll go five miles out of their way to show you
                    how to get there, lead you. So Soares really had his work cut out for him. He
                    had a long-range vision for Portugal, and eventually he got there. But I could
                    see what he was up against when I would go around to these communities and talk
                    to people. I would ask questions about moving their focus from the Atlantic to
                    Europe, and I didn't get much of a response.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there problems with Canada over fishing at that
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0150" n="Page0150"/>
                <p>HOLMES: No, I had a big fishing problem. The world price on cod is set in
                    Portugal. I mean, it is the national dish. They love codfish. There must be
                    close to a thousand different ways of preparing codfish. It's so popular that by
                    the end of the 18th century, Portuguese waters were basically fished out. There
                    weren't any cod left. One of the first exports of the United States as a young
                    nation in the late 18th century to Portugal was codfish - from off of Cape Cod.
                    They got most of their codfish from Iceland and from Norway. But increasingly
                    expensive and in shorter and shorter supply. At a certain point, an enterprising
                    Alaskan business brought in to Madeira a load of Pacific cod. Then I got a lot
                    of pressure from Senator Stevens to sell this to the Portuguese and to establish
                    a relationship between some of the principal fishery import companies and
                    Alaska. I tried. I tried my damnedest. They didn't like it. It tasted the same -
                    certainly to me it tasted the same - but it had a different shape. They were so
                    traditional that they did not go for Pacific cod. I got into a lot of trouble.
                    There were all sorts of threats about support for Portuguese aid if we didn't
                    come through on this cod deal. Well, there never was a deal. This enterprising
                    guy just took a chance and brought in this load of codfish and stashed in a
                    warehouse where it was rapidly rotting, and there were not buyers. But it was,
                    again, a very conservative country changing the diet on something as important
                    as codfish. That was my major fisheries war that I had when I was there.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: I was blessed. When we got there, there was a DCM there, and I was
                    extremely happy. It was Ed Rowell, who was a fabulous diplomat. His wife was one
                    of the great Foreign Service spouses of all time. In fact, Rowell and I put her
                    up for the Avis Bohlen award, and she won it. They were the most exemplary
                    Foreign Service couple. They knew the place inside out. They had friends all
                    over the place. They both spoke fluent Portuguese. They really made our job easy
                    for us when we came in, and a guy who had tremendous judgment and later was
                    ambassador in several places including going back to Portugal at one point.</p>

                <pb facs="0151" n="Page0151"/>
                <p>HOLMES: A great DCM. My second DCM was also terrific, Alan Flanigan, who later
                    was head of our interest section in Havana, Cuba, and then went as ambassador to
                    Nicaragua or El Salvador - I can't remember exactly which now. They were
                    wonderful, and again, an outstanding DCM who had both European and Latin
                    American experience.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Speaking of Latin America, what about our Central American
                        policy? Did that cause any problems for you? We're talking about Nicaragua,

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Not major problems, but we got a pretty good roasting in the press.
                    Although Mario Soares was always very polite, it was very clear where his
                    sympathies lay. This was a troubling aspect of US policy for him, for his very
                    natural and strong relationship, strong feelings of friendship and alliance with
                    the United States. Clearly there were differences there, and particularly the
                    people around him, some of his staff people whom we knew very well and liked.
                    Jim Creagan, who was political counselor and who had made a lot of friends in
                    Portugal, and he and I would sometimes sit down over dinner with some of the
                    Socialist staff people and have some pretty strong arguments about our Latin
                    American policy, which they largely disapproved of. But it wasn't a big problem
                    just because that relationship between the United States and Portugal was so
                    strong, this very special relationship, so it never tore at the innards of our
                    relationship the way it did in other countries.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: In '85, I left Portugal and I came back to Washington. George Shultz
                    asked me to come back and be assistant secretary for political-military affairs
                    - actually, director of the Bureau of Political-Military Affairs, and then when
                    I got back the Senate insisted that it be made an assistant secretaryship. So I
                    was in fact the first assistant secretary for political-military affairs.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <p>Today is May 21, 1999. Allen, you came back when, and how long were you Assistant
                    Secretary for Political-Military Affairs?</p>
                <pb facs="0152" n="Page0152"/>
                <p>HOLMES: I came back in June of 1985. I came back actually for two weeks overlap
                    with my predecessor, who was an Air Force lieutenant general, Jack Chain.
                    Secretary George Shultz had had two senior military officers as his director for
                    political-military affairs. The first was a vice admiral, and then Jack Chain
                    was the guy that I replaced. Shultz actually had been interested in continuing
                    that kind of a relationship with the Defense Department. He felt very strongly -
                    and I heard him speak to the issue a number of times - that the Secretary of
                    State was a charter member of the National Security Council and that he had as
                    much interest in and right to national security information as the Secretary of
                    Defense. He felt very strongly about this, and so he felt very comfortable
                    having a three-star flag officer as his director of political-military affairs
                    because he felt, among other things, that it gave him very direct military and
                    strategic advice, but also that it gave him a connection with the Joint Chiefs
                    of Staff, which was very important to him, as I will point out later in probably
                    the most important era of arms control negotiations with the Soviet Union,
                    largely conducted under his leadership.</p>
                <p>He was not satisfied, though, after General Chain, with the kind of officers who
                    were available. I had met him a couple of times, once in Washington before going
                    to Portugal and then when he came to open the embassy and sign the base rights
                    agreement with the Portuguese and then a third time when he accompanied
                    President Reagan to Portugal on an official state visit. We had a long
                    conversation about arms control in the car, and he seemed interested that I had
                    some knowledge of the subject, based on my experience in Rome and earlier
                    assignments, and during the visit of the President, he sent word back to
                    Washington to check me out with the Joint Chiefs. By the time I met him at a
                    meeting of chiefs of mission in Europe in London about three weeks later, he
                    offered me the job, and I accepted with alacrity. He made it very clear that,
                    first of all, I would be the first assistant secretary because Congress was
                    insistent that this important position be subjected to congressional scrutiny
                    and that whole process. But he also made it clear that he wanted me to choose as
                    a senior deputy a flag officer so that he could continue that connection with
                    the Joint Chiefs of Staff.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: It was not entirely clear to me, but of course I was delighted. It was a
                    field that I was extremely interested in. It was a very challenging job, with a
                    lot of scope. I was, frankly, delighted to be invited to take that job. I came
                    back in June for two weeks of overlap with Jack Chain. I then returned to Lisbon
                    to make all my farewells and reported for duty about the first of July and
                    quickly did a little bit of reorganizing - not a lot - in the Bureau of
                    Political-Military Affairs. We went through my hearings, and that went
                    astonishingly quickly. Then I went off on a trip later in July with Shultz to
                    Southeast Asia, which was a tremendous introduction for me to a dimension of my
                    new job and also to what it was like to work with George Shultz.</p>

                    interesting because, in fact, one of the major arms control initiatives that
                    Shultz launched happened after the election, and it was the Paris Conference on
                    Chemical Warfare that took place, I think it was, towards the end of January of
                    '89. He was still very much in business, even though there was a new government
                    coming in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk about George Shultz first, particularly you
                        went on this trip in Southeast Asia. Could you tell what you were picking up
                        on how George Shultz operated and how you evaluated him then and how this
                        developed over the next four years?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, first of all, I saw right away that George Shultz was a really an
                    extraordinary leader in that he combined the best of executive leadership, the
                    ability to handle simultaneously several major portfolios of foreign policy, to
                    keep track of them, to take initiative when the circumstances indicated; and he
                    also was a great leader. Despite some people's impression of him because of his
                    public appearance as being the great Buddha, a man who seemed frequently to have
                    sort of a passive expression, George Shultz had a lot of charisma, and he
                    inspired people. He cared about his people, not just those who worked directly
                    for him, but he was one of the few secretaries of state - in fact, probably, in
                    my lifetime, the only secretary of state that I can remember - who cared deeply
                    about the institution, about the Foreign Service, about the Civil Service in the
                    institution, about the Foreign Service Institute. I mean his sense of leadership
                    of the institution was broad, very broad. He had an unusual leadership style
                    that defied the classic management spread of “supervise no more than five
                    entities.” He had 30 people reporting directly to him. I was one of them, as an
                    assistant secretary. I had a minimum of five meetings with him a week. Four of
                    them were in groups - a group of assistant secretaries, or a group of people
                    concerned with national security affairs, different configurations - but I also
                    had one private meeting with him every week, which was scheduled to last 15
                    minutes and could be expanded if necessary. That doesn't include the many
                    emergency meetings, when we were in the middle of a negotiation or some crisis,
                    that took place in his back office. This was really an amazing style, which was
                    totally changed by his successor, by Jim Baker, who had the classic
                    management-indicated pyramid of basically five. He created an additional
                    undersecretary, and he had five under secretaries reporting to him. He didn't
                    want to have assistant secretaries reporting directly to him. It was a very
                    different management style.</p>
                <pb facs="0154" n="Page0154"/>
                <p>Shultz, on this trip... I remember very clearly going to Bangkok with him, and we
                    had several, I would call them, routine issues with the Thai Government, but the
                    one issue that was not routine was the problem involving the Cambodian refugees
                    that were in camps just inside the Thai border with Cambodia. Under Thai
                    military escort, we went by both helicopter and vehicle to this camp, and it was
                    a very moving experience. The first thing that we all noticed when we approached
                    this one sort of large barracks-like hall, was a huge crimson banner, and it
                    said, “Welcome, Mr. Shultz. Pleas help us turn Cambodian killing fields into
                    planting fields.” It was incredible. Shultz was very moved, and he immediately
                    just got into the throng of Cambodians there. Only a handful spoke English. They
                    had international NGOs who were basically helping them and obviously had helped
                    construct the sign, but it was almost like a kind of... I don't want to overdo
                    this. It was certainly not a prayer meeting but it was a very sort of a
                    spiritual connection that he made with these people, and you could tell that he
                    was really determined to help in any way he could. Also, he saw, of course, the
                    strategic advantage. I mean, from the point of view of our Thai allies, it was
                    important to get these people resettled in their own country, to end the Khmer
                    Rouge rampages in Cambodia and to remove that pressure from the Thais. As long
                    as the Cambodians were there, it was an invitation for all kinds of things -
                    cross-border raids, imminent combat, smuggling, and that kind of thing. So that
                    was a tremendous introduction.</p>
                <p>I also watched him doing a ceremony thing. We went to Fiji on this trip, stopped
                    off in Fiji. There I watched him go through a ceremony involving drinking some
                    horrible potion where he managed to control himself and not gag, as he was
                    required to drink this during the sort of sacred part of the ceremony. He did it
                    with good will, bonhomie, and delighted the Fiji Islanders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He didn't have to eat “long pig.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, we didn't. But anyway, that was sort of my introduction to working
                    for George Shultz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find - when we were talking about his
                        management style, with all these people reporting to him and then crisis
                        coming up - was he able to try to keep on top of the various issues?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. First of all, Shultz was an extraordinarily
                    well-prepared individual, probably better prepared for this job than anybody in
                    my lifetime, with the possible exception, obviously, of Henry Kissinger. Shultz
                    - after all, this is his fourth Cabinet position - he had been Secretary of
                    Labor, Secretary of the Treasury, which had introduced him to many leaders
                    around the world - that's where he became friends with Helmut Schmidt early on,
                    his Japanese counterpart, years of Bank and Fund meetings - he had also been
                    director of OMB.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0155" n="Page0155"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Office of Budget and Management.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Then, in addition to that, he had been president - I don't know if he was
                    president, chairman, or CEO, but I think he was president and CEO - of Bechtel.
                    Cap Weinberger, who has been serving as Secretary of Defense, was also in a
                    management position, but subordinate to Shultz, which is interesting, as I will
                    recount later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's obviously a relationship.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: They had known each other a long time. In addition, he had been a full
                    professor of economics at MIT. Here was a guy with extraordinary experience and
                    dimensions to his background, his academic preparation. He brought all of this
                    to bear on the job of Secretary of State in a marvelous way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I keep hearing the name of Charlie Hill. What was his
                        role?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, Charlie Hill was his senior special assistant in his immediate
                    office for a very long time, and he and Nick Platt, whom Shultz recruited to be
                    the executive secretary of the Department, the two of them together were
                    undoubtedly his most intimate, trusted, inside advisors. Charlie was very much
                    the inside-his-office advisor, and Nick had equal access and was consulted on a
                    range of things but also, basically, ran the nerve center of the Department of
                    State from his perch as executive secretary.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find these two men? Were they facilitators,
                        blockers, or how... I mean, from your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, no - facilitators. Shultz would never have allowed blockers. He
                    wanted some system. It was a very big operation he was running. He didn't want
                    to have a kind of a loose, open-door policy, come in and have endless
                    discussions. But they were definitely facilitators, and they were both very
                    astute men who had experience and ideas of their own but who were, of course,
                    very loyal to Shultz and helped him do his job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived on board, not having a geographic bureau,
                        you kind of know what you're up to, but the political-military one is a
                        little more amorphous, and I was wondering how - I would imagine it would
                        depend on the times, the Secretary of State, the person in there, and all
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Very much so.</p>
                <pb facs="0156" n="Page0156"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you see your job, and how did George Shultz see
                        your job in 1985 when you arrived on board?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I didn't have to stumble around too much and figure out what I had to do.
                    First of all, I inherited an organization which had very specific
                    responsibilities, which I assumed and carried on. Shultz gave me very clear
                    guidance. It was interesting: separately, but in close proximity one to the
                    other, he had a sort of a kickoff meeting with Roz Ridgway, who had just
                    recently - about maybe just before I came on board - been named assistant
                    secretary for European and Canadian affairs. He basically told Roz that he
                    wanted her to concentrate - in addition to all of her other duties - on the
                    US-Soviet relationship that he felt was going to undergird and dominate the
                    Reagan Administration. So that was her assignment. In the meeting with me, he
                    told me what he had said to Roz Ridgway and that I should work very closely with
                    her, but what he wanted me to concentrate on was arms control. Now this was
                    interesting because, first of all, the sort of coordination of arms control
                    policy and negotiations was not done in the National Security Council, and it
                    was not done in ACDA. It was done in the State Department, which was very
                    unusual, and that was Shultz's desire - and he saw what was coming. Basically,
                    given the extraordinary significance in terms of foreign policy and strategy and
                    the world position of the United States and the relationship with the Soviet
                    Union, Shultz wanted to control the arms control agenda, and so therefore he
                    wanted somebody, a confirmed official in the State Department, to ride herd on
                    the process. So he made it very clear to me. He wanted the chairmanship of the
                    NSC system to reside in the State Department. I chaired - at the level of
                    assistant secretary - every arms control negotiation and policy process except
                    for one, and the one I didn't chair was the START, the Strategic Arms
                    Negotiations, and that one I co-chaired, but as a kind of a second chair with
                    the Defense Department. That was Richard Perle who was the assistant secretary
                    of international security policy, a new job which had been created in the Reagan
                    Administration, a part of the old ISA, International Strategic Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about a Pentagon job.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0157" n="Page0157"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Pentagon, yes. Obviously they had equal claim to run a negotiation on
                    strategic arms. So that one was chaired, but all the others - INF, conventional
                    arms, chemical weapons, nuclear testing, and something that was new that we were
                    working on, the Missile Technology Control R�gime - all these were chaired by me
                    out of the State Department. That caused some problems, particularly in ACDA. It
                    took a lot of management to sort of keep them on board and not be obstructionist
                    in the development of policy and the oversight of the negotiations. So
                    typically, when Shultz went on the road and in our panoply of negotiations that
                    were going on at various speeds and levels, but with an eye on the main game,
                    which was INF initially and also Start - the Intermediate Nuclear Force
                    negotiations - those were basically SS-20s, Cruise missiles, Pershings, and so
                    forth - and then the strategic ones - that was the major concentration. Once in
                    a while those negotiations would stall. They'd hit a wall or they'd reach a
                    plateau of achievement and they couldn't quite figure out how to take it to the
                    next level. When that happened, Shultz would gather up his most intimate
                    advisors, the lead among whom was Paul Nitze, who taught Shultz a lot. He was
                    really Shultz's tutor in arms control, deliberately. Shultz hired him for that.
                    He was his senior, very wise advisor and was involved in everything that had to
                    do with arms control. I worked a lot. I was basically helping Paul Nitze help
                    Shultz and a couple of other key people in the Department.</p>
                <p>From time to time, Shultz would gather this group together, and the NSC system,
                    basically with all agencies represented, and we'd take off for Moscow, and we
                    would have a series of meetings with the Soviets - Shultz working with his
                    counterpart, Eduard Shevardnadze, who was foreign minister - to break logjams
                    and to take the negotiations to the next level. When we went to Moscow, we would
                    typically fly to Finland. We'd stop there. We'd rest overnight, kind of get over
                    jet lag, and then the next day we'd have a strategy session. We'd go into the
                    embassy and work out of the secured conference room and put the final tactical
                    touches on the strategy that we wanted to follow in the discussions with the
                    Soviets. Our ambassador, who most of the time, as I recall, was Jack Matlock,
                    would fly over from Moscow and meet us, give us the latest state of mind and
                    state of negotiations of the Soviet Government, and the next morning we'd fly
                    off to Moscow. We would go immediately to the Foreign Ministry guest house,
                    which was sort of an ornate, paneled, comfortable rich man's house that had been
                    built in the early part of the 20th century and which was not sort of the
                    official guest house of the Foreign Ministry, a very good place to have
                    meetings. It was large. There was a very large dining room. We would start off
                    with a plenary session with Shultz and Shevardnadze co-chairing, and then we
                    would break up into working groups and work like hell for the rest of the day,
                    most of that night, and the following day, and the following night; and then the
                    third day we would report. We would come in - it was almost like a show-and-tell
                    process in a grade school - two by two. I handled a variety of things. We always
                    had our negotiators on INF and START come in from the field, and they would
                    obviously continue their negotiations themselves. But I would pick up typically
                    chemical warfare, nuclear testing, sometimes work a little bit on conventional
                    arms control. I would always volunteer to do whatever needed to be tended to,
                    and I would always make sure that the director of ACDA, who was with us, Ken
                    Edelman...</p>

                        and every where else. Just the fact that you're interloping, I think, would
                        send off all sorts of obstructions.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: You've put your finger on a problem that was contained but that was
                    potentially destructive. It could have had a major deleterious effect on the
                    conduct of arms control policy negotiations, but it didn't. It didn't, first and
                    foremost because of Shultz's absolutely superb leadership. He didn't allow it to
                    happen. I mean Ken Edelman, the director of the Arms Controls and Disarmament
                    Agency, was always invited to meetings. He was never excluded. He was always
                    invited. When Shultz went on the road, on these periodic visits - sometimes we
                    went to Geneva, but mostly to Moscow - Ken was always there at his right hand.
                    His views were sought, and Ken would make his input and he made a contribution.
                    Sometimes his views were 180 degrees off course from those of Shultz and Nitze,
                    and at that point we all worked to persuade him where the policy should be
                    going. He would eventually come on board, particularly if... You see, Shultz was
                    always very clever about having the Chiefs with him, because obviously in
                    something as-</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: The Joint Chiefs of Staff - something as critical as strategic and
                    tactical nuclear weapons. I mean, Shultz, as I said, considered himself a member
                    of the National Security Council, but he never made a move in the way of an
                    innovation, of a departure from policy, of what might be a very significant new
                    round with out consulting the Chiefs. Typically before leaving on the trip to
                    Helsinki and on to Moscow, Shultz would have an early breakfast meeting with the
                    Chiefs before leaving. Now obviously a lot of discussion at a lower level had
                    preceded that meeting, but typically Shultz and Nitze and the National Security

                <p>HOLMES: Colin Powell had it for a good bit, but at one time Frank Carlucci had
                    it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: But most of the time when I was there it was Colin Powell. Well, Colin
                    Powell served in two capacities in my job. He was the military assistant to
                    Secretary Weinberger. Then he went off to get his required assignment as a corps
                    commander, a three-star billet - I think it was the Fifth Corps in Germany. He
                    loved that job but didn't...</p>
                <p>As I recall, Colin got his third star when he went to take the Fifth Corps in
                    Germany, returned within a year, I'm pretty sure, at the insistence of Frank
                    Carlucci, who had been asked to be national security advisor and who said that
                    he would not take the job unless Colin Powell could be his deputy. So Colin was
                    brought back kicking and screaming, because he loved the field job, which every
                    military officer wants to have. So he emerged once again at the Wednesday
                    breakfast.</p>
                <pb facs="0160" n="Page0160"/>
                <p>I have to explain about that institution because it was very important. Every
                    Wednesday during the Reagan Administration, basically the four years at least
                    that I observed it as assistant secretary for political-military affairs, there
                    was a policy breakfast which took place alternately at the State Department and
                    the Defense Department. It was the two secretaries, the two deputies - the
                    deputy secretary of defense and state - the number-three person, the
                    undersecretary, in the State Department for political affairs, who was Mike
                    Armacost most of the time, and the equivalent undersecretary on the defense
                    side, who was Fred Ikl�, and the national security advisor, the deputy national
                    security advisor. The two senior staff guys who set up the meeting and took the
                    follow-on action, were me, as the political-military guy in the State Department
                    and Colin Powell, who was a major general and at the time senior military
                    advisor to the Secretary of Defense. Our job every week, several days in
                    advance, would be to sort of pulse the bureaucracy, to identify the four, five,
                    six, maybe sometimes as many as seven or eight major topics that needed
                    attention and discussion for the breakfast meeting, staff them out so that our
                    leaders would come to the breakfast prepared to address these subjects, and then
                    do the follow-up afterwards on decisions that had been made. Now decisions that
                    were not reached, where the issue was not sufficiently joint or there was just
                    flat-out disagreement between Shultz and Weinberger - which happened from time
                    to time - those issues would then be taken by the national security advisor to
                    the President. He would frame the disagreement - and obviously give his own
                    advice on it, which we never saw - to the President, and decisions were made. It
                    was an excellent mechanism, very orderly, occasionally quite combative. It was
                    the best kind of policy discussion because basically ideas clashed.
                    Personalities intruded, yes, to some degree, but mostly these were serious
                    professionals fighting for their particular position with their counterparts,
                    and it worked extremely well. There were disagreements. There's no question
                    about it. You read about it. The press made more of it, I think, than really
                    existed, but there were disagreements between Shultz and Weinberger. Shultz had
                    a psychological advantage on him because, in addition to being the senior
                    Cabinet officer, he had always been one half step ahead of Weinberger in the
                    hierarchy. That was true at Bechtel and at OMB - the same thing.</p>

                        Welfare, wasn't Shultz Treasury or something which would have been one
                        higher up in the pecking order?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, I think so. I don't remember exactly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But it's of that ilk.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: But Shultz was very smart. He was very cagey in the way he used this. He
                    wasn't heavy at all about it. He was quite subtle. He didn't need to be. So that
                    was an excellent mechanism.</p>
                <pb facs="0161" n="Page0161"/>
                <p>By the way, I should comment here that over that four-year period when I saw
                    Colin Powell first as the military assistant, then as the deputy national
                    security advisor, and then as national security advisor in his own right, which
                    happened after Frank Carlucci moved over to replace Weinberger as Secretary of
                    Defense, Colin Powell was a remarkable senior official of our government. I
                    mean, the guy had extraordinarily good common sense, good judgment. He was very
                    schooled in all the issues. He did his homework. He never came to a meeting
                    where he didn't know absolutely everything that needed to be known about the
                    subject at hand and was helpful to both secretaries in moving an issue that was
                    stalled, where there wasn't a sufficient focus or where the issue really wasn't
                    joint. Sometimes he used kind of what I would call silly humor. I remember one
                    particularly difficult discussion which ended in silence. It was one of those
                    pregnant silences that is so embarrassing that you feel it's going on for
                    minutes. In total it was probably less than a minute. It was a very long
                    silence, and finally here we were having breakfast, and Colin Powell said, with
                    his winning smile, “Okay, it's time for a milk and cookies break.” Which was
                    totally absurd, but it broke the ice. Everybody laughed, and somebody was
                    waiting for that to happen, and we got back to business. The guy was a
                    remarkable leader in that sense. I'll tell you, later on, when I saw him
                    struggling with his possible candidacy for President, I have to tell you that I
                    was very hopeful that he would run, because I think Colin Powell would make a
                    great President. I saw him in action over a period of four years, a man of great
                    class, judgment, humor, who had that ability to keep his eye on the strategic
                    objective but was also a superb tactician. I also saw it when he came as the
                    national security advisor on Shultz's trips to Moscow. He had a couple of very
                    brainy Air Force missile experts who understood the complexities of arms control
                    formulations very well, and he tutored at their feet and then mastered the
                    subject. In our strategy sessions leading to the visits to Moscow, he would be
                    absolutely terrific when Secretary Shultz would turn to him and ask him his
                    advice. He was terrific, and he never pretended to speak for the Chiefs. That
                    would not have been proper, as the national security advisor, but he understood
                    very well where they were coming from. Of course, in the mean time, Shultz
                    before the trip had had breakfast with the Chiefs and had told them exactly what
                    he intended to do, and he would always end by saying - and he would get
                    agreement... actually, Shultz at that point knew more on most of the subject
                    matter than the Chiefs, with one exception, and that was Bob Heres, who was the
                    vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under Admiral Bill Crowe, and he was
                    an Air Force guy, and he had space command and really understood the whole ABM
                    and the START dimension of what we were doing. But he would get their assent,
                    and he would always promise them: he said, “If I go beyond this position, if
                    there is an opportunity to move this process further down the road, beyond where
                    you have agreed, I will put it on hold with the Soviets, and I will consult you
                    before moving to the next level.” He was absolutely faithful and disciplined
                    about that, and as a result he had the trust and the confidence of the Joint
                    Chiefs of Staff - terribly important.</p>

                        and all that, had left a legacy of unease that Shultz was overcoming?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0162" n="Page0162"/>
                <p>HOLMES: No, not really. That never came up. But I should tell you one other thing
                    that was very important to this process. Shultz had said to me, “I want you to
                    have as your principal deputy a flag officer.” I went to see Admiral Bill Crowe,
                    who was the chairman, and I said, you know, that Shultz would like that, and I
                    would like it too, and could I ask his help in identifying the right officer,
                    who would be a two-star, basically, a major general or equivalent admiral. Crowe
                    said that he had somebody in mind, that he would get me the very best, but only
                    on condition that this individual be my principal deputy, not just one of the
                    deputies. So that was easy. I assented right away because when he told me that
                    he had in mind Bill Burns, who was an Army major general and who had been Paul
                    Nitze's JCS representative on his team in the early years of negotiating the INF
                    Treaty - the famous walk in the woods in Geneva? Bill Burns had been his advisor
                    and was, himself, very familiar with the systems. He'd commanded the Army's -
                    I'm not using the correct designation - nuclear brigade in Germany. And so he
                    was extremely... really quite a brilliant officer and had had field experience
                    and policy experience, so he was the perfect deputy. I must say, I was extremely
                    lucky to have somebody of his quality. The fact that Bill Burns worked with me
                    helped assuage any concerns that the joint staff might have about what we were
                    up to. I mean, it was one thing for Shultz to satisfy the Chiefs; it was another
                    thing to satisfy the concerns of the next level, the sort of flag level of the
                    joint staff, and Bill Burns was enormously helpful. I made my own contribution
                    using my diplomatic skills and my own leadership at my level in bringing in all
                    the representatives of the arms control community, including ACDA, and making
                    them feel part of the team and trying to replicate at my level what Shultz was
                    doing, which was not to surprise them, but to take a little time to persuade
                    them of the sense of a particular position or particular move and to bring them
                    along. Sometimes I stalled at my level, and it was hard work. I occasionally
                    would have differences not so much with Richard Perle - because he was usually
                    on trips - but with his staff. Perle would send his representatives from the OSD
                    to meetings and say, “Take a hard line and then double it in strength.” I would
                    come up with a reasonable formulation of a position, and I would get an absolute
                    stonewall. I'd have to wait, frequently, until Perle returned from a visit. He
                    was always hard to get to. I even collared him one time with a formulation in my
                    pocket in the men's room of the British ambassador's house. I knew he was going
                    to be at this dinner, and I caught him in there and showed him this paper, and
                    he said, “Oh, that looks fine to me, very reasonable.” I said, “Well, your staff
                    thinks it's awful.” He said, “Oh, well, I'll take care of that.”</p>

                <pb facs="0163" n="Page0163"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, no. Roz played a huge role. In fact, Roz's role, in many ways, was
                    more important than mine because, basically, she was concentrating on the
                    U.S.-Soviet relationship and working very closely with Jack Matlock and using
                    her staff, using the Office of Soviet Affairs, to staff her up for these
                    meetings. Roz played an extremely important role. We worked very well together.
                    We were old friends, and we just didn't have any problems. I would test
                    formulations on her that were perhaps a little bit out of the ordinary to see
                    how she thought the Soviets would react to this. Now the ace that the Soviets
                    always had, or at least the wild card, I would say, in all of these, was a man
                    named Marshal Akhromeyev. Marshal Akhromeyev was the equivalent of the chairman
                    of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Whenever he showed up for meetings when we went to
                    Moscow, Shultz and I and Roz would look at each other and we'd say we can make
                    progress at this meeting, because if Akhromeyev was there, we knew that
                    Shevardnadze, just like Shultz, who would check with the JCS before the visit,
                    with Akhromeyev's presence (and sometimes he would show up in Geneva at those
                    meetings) would be bringing a point of view and he would be able on the spot,
                    pretty much, to make decisions - whereas if he weren't there, Shevardnadze would
                    have to defer until later. I mean he never put it that way, but in fact that was
                    what was happening.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Akhromeyev and Crowe became quite close afterwards.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: They became close friends. Akhromeyev, of course, had a tragic end. He
                    committed suicide.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Akhromeyev was an absolutely fascinating figure. I saw a lot of him, and
                    a number of us, frequently, late at night, after sessions, when we'd finished,
                    we'd have a beer together before retiring at three o'clock in the morning or so,
                    and he talked a lot about his background. He was about five-eight, five-nine,
                    probably weighed 110 pounds soaking wet - an extraordinary figure. He had fought
                    the Battle of Stalingrad, and he told us one night that he went something like
                    230 days in the open, where he never slept in a warm bed, never was able to
                    relax and take a shower and take a couple of weeks off. He said, “We lost so
                    many people, that when my weight got down to 85 pounds, the medics pulled me out
                    and sent me off to fatten me up.” So he said, “I had about three weeks away, and
                    then back into combat.” In his graduating class from high school, only three
                    survived, and he was one of the three. I mean, amazing. This guy was absolutely
                    convinced of the importance of not only capping but beginning the process of
                    negotiating the end to the nuclear standoff between the Soviets-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what “capping” means?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0164" n="Page0164"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Capping means, basically, stopping the growth of strategic weapons. The
                    history of arms control went through various phases, and in the early years,
                    when Kissinger was at it with SALT I and the ABM, the idea there was to put a
                    ceiling on the growth. In subsequent phases, we began to negotiate down. With
                    Akhromeyev, we were, of course, in a very significant phase of negotiating down.
                    He was philosophically, humanistically (I use that word carefully) convinced
                    that this was the right thing to do. This was where his and Gorbachev's and
                    Shevardnadze's views converged. These three men together were terribly affected
                    by the Chernobyl accident, because it gave them graphic evidence of what they
                    already knew theoretically, graphic evidence of what nuclear poisoning can do to
                    people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what the Chernobyl accident was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, well, the Chernobyl nuclear reactor in Kiev that exploded and
                    basically they weren't able to contain the radiation, and a lot of people were
                    exposed, a lot of people died as a result of that. It was a horrible... It was
                    the greatest nightmare nuclear that's probably happened in our time, other than,
                    of course, from the point of view of the Japanese, Hiroshima and Nagasaki. But
                    the Soviets lost a lot of people, and a lot of children. The effects of the
                    radiation and the plume, the cloud, were felt for a very long time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And a huge area of the Ukraine was made unusable.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, not only a huge area of the Ukraine, but even going north. Do you
                    know that the Scandinavians, they detected sufficient particles in the air that
                    they were worried enough that they slaughtered something like 80,000 head of
                    reindeer. I mean hunting was a big thing in Scandinavia, particularly north of
                    the Arctic Circle among the Lapps, but they were so concerned that these herds
                    had become infected by the movement of the nuclear plume into their area that
                    they actually required the slaughtering of vast herds of reindeer. But it was
                    the effect on the Soviet people, the Ukrainians and the people around Kiev. It
                    had a wrenching, deep-seated, lasting effect on Gorbachev, Shevardnadze, and
                    Akhromeyev. They were absolutely determined - obviously they wanted it to be
                    equitable and strategically viable with the United States; they didn't entirely
                    trust us any more than we trusted them, and they knew... This was a very
                    rigorous process that we went through. But Akhromeyev was a key figure, and of
                    course Gorbachev. He allowed it to happen. In other words, he would bring the
                    Soviet General Staff along with him, and lest we forget who we were dealing
                    with, one night he described to us in great detail, his admiration, his awe, of
                    Stalin - which struck us as sort of inconsistent with his approach to strategic
                    issues and to questions of life and safety of civilian populations - but then he
                    would go on to explain. He said, “You have no idea what it was like being a
                    Soviet citizen, a soldier, in World War II. He was our national savior. He was
                    our leader. He pulled our country together. He helped us blunt the Nazi assault
                    on our nation.”</p>
                <pb facs="0165" n="Page0165"/>
                <p>So he was a fascinating man. He came, towards the end, to the United States for a
                    three-week official visit as Admiral Bill Crowe's guest. Crowe spent about a
                    week with him, actually did some traveling with him, and when it was all over, I
                    asked Bill if he would give a very special briefing, if he would mind if Roz
                    Ridgway and three or four of us came over to his office and heard his account of
                    _________________, and he agreed to do it. He spent about an hour and a half
                    with us describing, and it was quite fascinating listening to him describe
                    Akhromeyev's reaction to the places that he saw, the equipment. He was less
                    impressed by the equipment. For example they went on a very large aircraft
                    carrier and watched flight operations, and he would say, “Oh, we have that too,”
                    or “We have that capability as well.” When the Harrier took off and hovered
                    opposite the bridge where they were standing and did a slow 360-degree turn, he
                    said, “No, we don't have that.” But basically he was impressed, but also he knew
                    what the Soviet Union had. But this is what impressed him: it was the
                    responsibility of non-commissioned officers and particularly the role of women
                    in our armed forces. Bill told us this story. They went to an F-15 flight line,
                    and they had all of it. They had the planes there on the runway or the parking
                    aprons, and they had the crews lined up, the pilot and the crew chief, and he
                    went up to one F-15 and the crew chief was a female sergeant, and she stood at
                    attention and described her responsibilities, which was basically, she was
                    responsible for the aircraft, everything to do with it, its weapons, its
                    functioning, spare parts, safety, the whole thing. At the end of this, she
                    paused, and she could tell that Akhromeyev didn't believe her, that she would
                    have that much responsibility. So she said, “Marshal, if you don't believe me,
                    ask the pilot.” The pilot was standing behind her. He was a major. He leaned
                    forward and said, “Marshal, my life is in her hands.” Apparently, he was so
                    overcome by this that in a moment of confusion he didn't know whether to salute
                    her or to hug her, so he took her hand, in an old-world way, and kissed her
                    hand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's remarkable. Speaking of this, to sort of set the
                        stage, what was your feeling and that of those around you about nuclear
                        weapons, because to the uninitiated these, to my mind, seemed to be sort of
                        unusable, and one can... I mean, the main thing you worry about is getting
                        into, one, irresponsible hands or, two, going off by accident. Other than
                        that you can't use them. It's sort of like talking about angels dancing on a
                        pin.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0166" n="Page0166"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, well, you've touched on what used to be known as MAD, “mutual
                    assured destruction.” Of course, that was for many years a kind of shorthand for
                    a guiding strategic principle that if you had a rough standoff in destructive
                    power and the ability to shoot at each other, to have sufficient accurate
                    guidance systems to bring the reentry vehicles down through the earth's
                    atmosphere and attack targets in the United States and vice versa, in the Soviet
                    Union, as long as you had a rough standoff in terms of capability, explosive
                    capability, the element of surprise, and the accuracy and reliability, you had
                    basically a standoff, you had a strategic equilibrium. The problem was that both
                    sides were always developing new and better weapons. The Soviets spent much more
                    time working on their intercontinental ballistic missiles and MIRVs (multiple
                    independent reentry vehicles). They would get up to the point where they would
                    have as many as eight weapons, reentry vehicles, each of which was calculated in
                    terms of explosive power in megatons, coming off of one “bus,” one weapon. One
                    missile would have eight reentry vehicles with enough power, each one of those
                    weapons, to destroy a major city in the United States. We put much more
                    emphasis, in the United States, on our sea-based systems, and we had, of course,
                    ICBM's. We had Peacekeeper and Minute Man, but these were, by Soviet standards,
                    more technologically compact. We worked much harder on accuracy. But our big
                    punch really was in our sea-launch systems. The Soviets couldn't match the
                    Trident systems. By the time we got to the Trident II boat and the Trident II D
                    missile, which could be fired submerged, below the surface, travel seven or
                    eight thousand miles and hit a target in the Soviet Union with a CEP, a circular
                    error probable, of maybe a couple of hundred feet. I mean a remarkable accuracy.
                    The contrary, to be able to fire a missile 8,000 miles and then have at least
                    one reentry vehicle land inside the doughnut of the Pentagon - that's the
                    equivalent accuracy. We had it; the Soviets had it. They had it with their
                    ICBM's, but they couldn't do it from a submerged position they way we could from
                    what we called “boomers,” the nuclear submarines that fired the sea-launched
                    ballistic missiles. They couldn't do it from a submerged position. We also had
                    much better silencing. Our ships could travel underneath the polar ice cap, stay
                    submerged for weeks on end, and not be detected. We had a very, very
                    extraordinary system. That system was the ultimate stealthy strategic system.
                    The Soviets didn't have that. So they put much more into land-based.</p>
                <p>Well, there was a rough strategic parity and a mutually assured destruction, but
                    we all knew that we had to put an end to this. The more weapons you put out
                    there, the more possibilities there are for accidents, for inattention, for
                    miscalculations in strategic terms. The wrong people came into power in one
                    country or the other - you know. I think there was a growing realization that
                    this had to stop. We had to put an end to it.</p>
                <pb facs="0167" n="Page0167"/>
                <p>Now the other complicating factor, of course, was the ABM treaty, and that had
                    also been concluded, and this is where Ronald Reagan introduced probably, in
                    terms of persuading the Soviets that it was time to change and to negotiate
                    seriously in reducing weapons, introducing the SDI, the Strategic Defense
                    Initiative, known as “Star Wars” popularly. That happened in 1983. It was
                    announced by Cap Weinberger, and there was a special directorate set up in the
                    Pentagon headed by a lieutenant general, Jim Abrahamson, to develop this weapons
                    system. This is a directorate that reported directly to the Secretary of
                    Defense. A great deal of money was put into this program, and Shultz would ask
                    for and receive periodic briefings on its progress. It was very interesting to
                    watch him. He was deeply skeptical of the technology that was being developed,
                    whether this would work. What he was not skeptical of, and which we saw, was the
                    extraordinary miniaturization that was taking place, in terms of communications
                    and sensors, and actually, they would be brought over, shrouded in special bags,
                    and we would go into this room and then Abrahamson and a couple of people from
                    his staff would brief Secretary Shultz on the progress. That part was
                    interesting. It was also interesting that Abrahamson was basically taking off
                    the shelf equipment and then improving it. But whether or not we could develop a
                    Star Wars system with space-borne platforms that could actually stop thousands
                    of reentry vehicles from entering the United States - I mean you could tell that
                    Shultz was very skeptical. He kept his skepticism to himself, because he
                    understood very well the effect that this was having on Soviet leaders, and he
                    could see that in the discussions. Every time he went Moscow or Geneva, the
                    discussions we would have with Shevardnadze, with Akhromeyev, and also with
                    Gorbachev - when he went to Moscow, he always went and saw Gorbachev - so Shultz
                    understood very well that the Soviets - and we, of course, had a lot of
                    intelligence that backed up this assessment - were feeling that they were being
                    swamped, that this was a whole new dimension to arms control that would throw
                    the mutual assured destruction formula into a cocked hat and that they couldn't
                    compete with us, that they would bankrupt their country if they tried to produce
                    either a counter to this or something equivalent. They had their own research
                    going on. They had their secret cities throughout the Soviet Union just like Los
                    Alamos and Sandia and Livermore - not quite the same, but equivalent - and they
                    had probably ten or twelve of these, and they were doing advanced laser weapon
                    research in places like Dushanbe, for example, and we knew about that. But they
                    also knew that we were ahead of them, way ahead, and that it would break the
                    bank. They just couldn't afford to compete. So that clearly had a major effect
                    on Soviet leadership. It strengthened their determination to do something
                    serious about the strategic standoff. That's a long, windy answer.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, no. That's exactly what I want. I'm trying to capture
                        the spirit of the times and how we saw it. Another thing of how we saw it -
                        when you came in in '85 and as you were getting into this, particularly in
                        this arms discussion, could you describe how we saw and who were the Soviet
                        leadership. You've implied this, but did we feel things were really changing
                        in '85, and how were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0168" n="Page0168"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, '85 was just sort of the tip of the iceberg. I can't remember now,
                    but I think it was... My memory fails... I should have looked this up before.
                    The first summit that Reagan had with Gorbachev was in Geneva. It was October or
                    November, and I think it was '86 that that happened. I think it was in the fall
                    of '86, but I'd have to check the record. But that was really the sort of
                    kickoff. It was not an easy meeting. Basically, the two leaders agreed on a
                    framework for negotiations and what would be on the table, and what would be
                    discussed, and obviously INF was one of them, and certainly START was another.
                    Chemical weapons were more remote in the formula. Reagan did very well with
                    Gorbachev. It was their first meeting, and about five assistant secretaries from
                    the State Department were there. The reason for that was that at the end of the
                    session we fanned out - there were about five of us - around the world to brief
                    governments on the results of this meeting because, first of all, there was
                    always a race to make sure that our version of what happened got there hopefully
                    before but not long after the Soviet version, because they did exactly the same
                    thing and more often than not they put a different spin on it, particularly with
                    respect to their own allies. I can remember one time, after going to one
                    meeting, going to both East Germany and to Poland and getting there before the
                    Soviets got there. I mean I went right from Moscow to these places. Anyway, on
                    this particular trip from a summit, I flew to Kuala Lumpur, where there was a
                    meeting taking place of seven or eight foreign ministers from Southeast
                    Asia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: ASEAN probably.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes. It was a kind of an ASEAN configuration. It was their own meeting;
                    it was an Asian meeting. I didn't brief all the foreign ministers, but I briefed
                    the host there, the Malaysian foreign minister, who in turn briefed the others.
                    So I hit both indirectly and directly some of those countries, and then I flew
                    to Canberra. I stopped in Sydney. I flew to Sydney and then flew to Canberra. I
                    had a meeting with the prime minister there. He was very appreciative of
                    receiving this briefing. I remember at the end coming out on the steps of the
                    Government House there, his office, and being attacked by the Australian press.
                    I thought the American press was vigorous and rude. I'd heard about the
                    Australian press, but I was subjected, the reason being that we had decided -
                    the New Zealanders were in the dog house, and we decided that we were not going
                    to go and brief, give them special treatment as an ally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That's because they wouldn't accept nuclear ships.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0169" n="Page0169"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, they wouldn't accept our policy statement of when a warship enters
                    an ally's port you neither confirm nor deny the presence of nuclear weapons.
                    That was the issue, the presence of nuclear weapons on board the ship. I mean,
                    all ships are known worldwide. There's a worldwide registry of what ships are
                    nuclear powered. What people didn't know was whether we had actual nuclear
                    weapons on board. Obviously, for strategic reasons, we didn't want our potential
                    adversaries to know, so that was a kind of standard formula, and everybody
                    accepted it until there was a change of government in New Zealand and they
                    changed it. They said they would no longer accept it. So we began to argue and
                    argue with the New Zealanders, and finally we sort of drummed them out of ANZUS.
                    Shultz did that. I have to say, on my advice. I said we had to make an issue of
                    this. Strategically it was just too damned important. Anyway, I remember being
                    actually raked over the coals by the Australian press after this meeting on that
                    subject, why aren't you going to New Zealand. I didn't want to say too much.</p>
                <p>From there, I returned to the United States, so that was the kickoff meeting. I
                    don't think there was another arms control summit until Gorbachev came to
                    Washington to sign the INF treaty, which was in '87.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in this meeting in Geneva, you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I did not sit in on the meetings. We were there. We would get debriefed
                    by Nitze or by Shultz.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern at the time about how our man, Ronald
                        Reagan, would do?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, there was. I remember Shultz telling us about how terrific he was,
                    in terms of the way he handled his brief. Because, you know, we'd already... I
                    can't remember if it was at that point or later that Reagan made his famous
                    speech about the Evil Empire.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think it was earlier on.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: But his views were well known. Gorbachev was a little skeptical about him
                    too, what kind of a man was this, and what was he dealing with? Reagan had a lot
                    of charm, and he disarmed Gorbachev with his charm in his approach and his
                    bonhomie to a remarkable degree, but of course stuck to his script. It was a
                    very productive first encounter. Each man got the feel of the other. Reagan
                    handled himself very well. I mean, Shultz reported all this to us. Shultz was
                    very loyal to Reagan, but I think the press gave him pretty a good report
                    card.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They did, but going into it-</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0170" n="Page0170"/>
                <p>HOLMES: There was a lot of skepticism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One always thought about the meeting of Kennedy with
                        Khrushchev in '61 in Vienna, where Khrushchev really jumped all over Kennedy
                        and Kennedy didn't respond too well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: That's right. He was surprised. I think he was a little bit blindsided by
                    the behavior, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Which meant that we were calling up reserves. You know, it
                        was not a productive meeting.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, it was not. You're right. I think the press and the world, the
                    cognoscenti, people who were interested in this kind of subject, were expecting
                    something similar, and it was not at all that way. Reagan, of course, didn't
                    have the foreign policy experience or knowledge or scholarship that Kennedy had,
                    but he also had something different. He always had a couple of strategic ideas -
                    not very well developed but very firmly believed - and he stuck to those. Also,
                    Gorbachev was a very different kind of Soviet leader. First of all he was a
                    teetotaler - very unusual among Soviet leaders not to consume vast quantities of
                    vodka. I mean, it has an effect on your demeanor and your mentality and your
                    metabolism.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As we know now as Yeltsin is president.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Exactly. But Gorbachev was a teetotaler, first of all. Secondly, he was a
                    very kind of rational individual.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An engineer.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0171" n="Page0171"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes. He was on his best behavior. He had a temper also. I remember one
                    visit to Moscow - I'm diverting here - where Soviet propaganda had spread the
                    word that the United States was conducting a biological terrorism campaign in
                    Africa by exporting to Africa AIDS. I mean, that was the latest enormity being
                    put out by the Soviet propaganda machine. Shultz brought it up with Gorbachev. I
                    wasn't there, but I heard about it right afterwards. Roz Ridgway was there, and
                    Colin Powell was there and Paul Nitze was there. That was it. Shultz took
                    Gorbachev to task for this and how outrageous this was. Gorbachev, because there
                    were all these Americans watching him, you know, replied in an angry way. He was
                    very upset because Shultz was harsh. He threw back, he said, “Well, you do
                    terrible things in your country, in contrast with the Soviet Union, where we
                    respect human rights - look at the way you treat your blacks and your women,” he
                    said - whereupon there was a pause, and Roz Ridgway and Colin Powell looked at
                    each other and burst out laughing. That broke the ice. That was the end of it.
                    They settled down. But it was kind of uncharacteristic for Gorbachev to behave
                    that way. That's because Shultz needled him, deliberately.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you start personally getting involved in these
                        arms control? Was it in '85?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, yes, right at the beginning. Absolutely from the beginning.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there the feeling that with Gorbachev and Shevardnadze
                        that you- (end of tape)</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I would say the short answer to that is no. It was only afterwards, as
                    time went on, as we began to achieve results, that we realized that we were
                    dealing with a different mentality, a different Soviet team. I'm speaking for
                    myself here, and I think for most of us, with the possible exception of Shultz
                    himself. We were all a bunch of Cold War warriors. We had a certain mentality
                    about the Soviets. We didn't trust them. We didn't like them. We thought they
                    were trying to steal our eggs, you know. The series of arms control negotiations
                    that we had with the Soviets in those days were hard fought. These were tough.
                    Frequently we'd have one step forward and two steps back. The Soviets were
                    tough, too. They were fighting hard in these negotiations. I took myself to task
                    for not being a very good listener. It's very important in diplomacy to learn
                    how to be a good listener, to listen carefully, because you might just pick up
                    something that, if you don't listen carefully, you miss.</p>
                <pb facs="0172" n="Page0172"/>
                <p>I had that experience. I told you that in these sessions in Moscow, when we would
                    go through Helsinki, and I probably went on four or five of them - probably
                    four, one in Geneva, a couple in Geneva, I can't remember exactly - but I would
                    typically square off with a Soviet counterpart on chemical warfare, and we
                    weren't making much progress, and we would argue and come up with formulations
                    because we knew that the following day we would have to go and report to Shultz
                    and Shevardnadze on how we had done, so we were working very hard. At a certain
                    point - it was probably our second meeting, maybe the third meeting - my Soviet
                    counterpart said that he was quite prepared for us to have a surprise inspection
                    formulation in our chemical warfare treaty or convention, whatever would emerge
                    from this negotiation, because of course you will remember that it was only
                    later, in the Bush Administration, that we went full-tilt on chemical warfare
                    treaty, which took basically four years to negotiate. I didn't believe the guy.
                    I thought he was putting me on, because he said “a surprise inspection
                    provision,” where we would just notify them and we could come, within six hours,
                    and inspect. I challenged him on this, and he said, “Well, I don't understand
                    your point of view. You introduced this at the last meeting, and now we're
                    accepting it, and you're not accepting it. You're rejecting it - your own
                    proposal.” We went round and round, and you know, I just didn't believe the guy.
                    He said certain things which I interpreted as basically a stall or a sort of a
                    deceiving term. I saw all the worst aspects of this. I had my blinders on. So
                    finally, we didn't succeed in putting together the language that he was
                    advocating. When we went to report to Shultz and Shevardnadze, Shevardnadze was
                    sort of to Shultz with, “What's going on here? What's wrong with your
                    negotiator? My man is trying to move this thing forward, and you're being very
                    obstructionist. What's the problem here?” Shultz was equally skeptical, and he
                    said, “Do you mean, Eduard,” he said, “do you mean to tell me that if we
                    challenged you and thought that here in the Kremlin, right inside your
                    government offices, that we had detected a chemical weapons laboratory and we
                    demanded to inspect it, that you would allow that?” He said, “Absolutely.”
                    Shultz looked at me, you know, in disbelief, and I looked at him in disbelief.
                    That was sort of the end of it. We didn't make much progress on the chemical
                    front at that meeting.</p>
                <p>Now when I returned to Washington, I made my notes and I debriefed and so forth.
                    I think this was in the late spring. That summer, the Soviet Foreign Ministry
                    had a three-day conference, which was Soviet only. It was diplomats and military
                    and their own think tank people and some of their own newsmen, and it was about
                    arms control. They had a lot of discussion; a lot of papers were presented; and
                    they wrote it all up in a nice little booklet, translated it, and sent it all
                    over the place. I got my copy and I took it home that weekend and read it. The
                    part I read very carefully was the part on chemical warfare. To my utter
                    astonishment, Shevardnadze, at this meeting, was blasting other Soviets and the
                    lingering “barbarism” - he used the word barbarism - of certain Soviet leaders
                    and thinkers and strategists to continue to develop chemical weapons - and what
                    a blight this had produced and what damage this was doing to the reputation of
                    the peace-loving Soviet people, that we in the Soviet Union would develop these
                    horrible nerve gas weapons.</p>
                <pb facs="0173" n="Page0173"/>
                <p>Well, I read that. I finished reading it, and I said, Holmes, you missed
                    something. This guy really believes this. He was sincere. He is fighting his own
                    bureaucracy, his own Cold War warriors in the Kremlin, and he wants to move this
                    process forward. The next session, which was a few months after that, it was a
                    very different session. We moved the ball forward. I told my Soviet counterpart,
                    I said, “Frankly, I didn't believe you when you said it the last time we were in
                    Moscow.” This was a very significant turning point, and I began to realize -
                    this goes back to your first question to me - we are dealing here with a new
                    mentality, a new generation of Soviet leaders.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find with the delegations that you were dealing
                        with from the Soviet Union sort of the new men and the would men?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We're talking about the old Soviet man and we're also
                        talking, then we'll talk about the American side too, but let's talk about
                        the Soviet side first.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0174" n="Page0174"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, this was very interesting. We had both. What we were observing under
                    Shevardnadze's leadership was a rather brutal transition from an older
                    generation to a new generation. In fact, I'll go so far as to say there was a
                    generation of Soviet diplomats that was decapitated. Early retirement. One or
                    two managed to sort of stay in the loop, but basically what Shevardnadze did was
                    to reach down to the sort of under-40 - in fact, early 30s - generation of
                    Soviet diplomats, who were much better educated, who had had a lot of exposure
                    to the West, many of whom spoke excellent English - a lot of which they had
                    learned from watching American movies, which sometimes produced some hilarity -
                    but basically, a very different breed, people that were more flexible. Of
                    course, they had Shevardnadze's agenda, but they also just looked at life in a
                    different way. This was a new generation, and it helped. When we finally figured
                    that out and understood it and started listening and working with these guys, it
                    made a difference, in terms of moving the process forward. In the mean time,
                    they were also struggling with the full array of Perestroika and Glasnost that
                    Gorbachev had introduced into their own society and taking some first tentative
                    steps towards establishing a free market economy, moving away from a command
                    economy. I can remember at one lunch that we had at this guest house, talking
                    with one of the old-style Soviet diplomats who still had his job, who had
                    studied economics and was very interested in what Gorbachev was trying to do and
                    wanted it to move faster, but told me, he said, “Can you imagine how difficult
                    it is in our country to move from a command economy towards the kind of
                    free-market-flow system that you have? Take the question of the factory that has
                    the contract to make boots for the Russian Army. They have quotas, and the
                    quotas bear no relationship whatsoever to need. That's a factory with x-number
                    of people working eight hours a day. They are required to produce y-amount of
                    boots. If they produce more, they do better than that, they get a bonus. The
                    result is we have warehouses filled with boots that no one will ever use, and we
                    don't know how to turn that off and change it.” He said, “That's just one
                    example of our entire supply system for the Soviet armed forces. Now,” he said,
                    “some of it is extremely sophisticated, as you know. What we've done in space
                    and some of our very advanced weapons, but it is completely a command economy.
                    All the best people in our schools go either to strategic work or to space work
                    - our best engineers, our best scientists, our best design engineers, industrial
                    designers, all those people that in your country are going into the private
                    sector - they're all going to our flagship industries, which are space and
                    defense. How do we change that?” He said, “This is exceedingly difficult.” It
                    was interesting that several times during visits to Moscow, over meals and also
                    in calls in their offices, particularly Gorbachev... Gorbachev got to the point
                    where, knowing that Shultz was an economist, he would ask him searching
                    questions and then listen and take notes. Shultz was frequently giving him
                    little tutorials on how the free-market economy worked. It was quite
                    fascinating, because of course they had this sort of hostile attitude towards
                    Wall Street and the stock market and how it was run by a handful of people and
                    exploiting the American worker - you know, all the propaganda that had been
                    developed in the '30s and through World War II and in the post-world war period.
                    They had to overcome that whole legacy of attitude and thinking. Gorbachev was
                    reaching out trying to understand, knowing that our system worked. He wanted to
                    know a lot more about it.</p>

                        when you'd go to Moscow and all, I mean this had not been your particular

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: -I mean you'd been western Europe.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I'd never been to Moscow before I went there the first time with Shultz,
                    and I was very frustrated because we worked so hard up into the wee hours of the
                    morning, then we had to go back to the embassy and write up our notes and
                    prepare for the next day's session, that I never got to see anything - except
                    one night in desperation, about the third time I was there, I remember going at
                    four o'clock in the morning - I said I'm going to see something this time. It
                    was in the winter. It was cold as hell, a blanket of snow. I went to Red Square
                    to see the changing of the guard in front of Lenin's Tomb. It was every hour,
                    and I went to see the four-o'clock performance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, with the delegation and all, were there at that
                        time, any sort of intimations that the Soviet Union might come apart?
                        Because we're talking about, what is it, well, by '92, it was gone.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No. I mean, occasionally Jack Matlock, our ambassador in Moscow, who
                    would come over to brief us on the situation, would explain that the twin
                    engines of change, Glasnost and Perestroika, that Gorbachev was putting in, were
                    stirring up a lot of resentment, and there were sectors of the Soviet
                    bureaucracy that felt threatened. Yes, he would talk about that, but the kind of
                    major upheaval that was to come, we didn't see it, we didn't hear much about it,
                    we were not aware of it, no.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain Glasnost and Perestroika?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0176" n="Page0176"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, Glasnost was “opening,” to “open up,” as I recall, and Perestroika
                    was “restructuring.” Basically those were the two main things. Shultz would take
                    on these trips, he would take our assistant secretary for human rights, and he
                    would go off and talk to people. Gorbachev wanted that. He and Shevardnadze were
                    willing for us to begin to introduce notions of human rights, to explain to them
                    our system of habeas corpus, due process, how our courts worked. Gorbachev was
                    very interested in learning how our legal system worked, and so Dick Schifter
                    had some fascinating meetings with Soviet lawyers and jurists, and that was all
                    part of the “Opening,” the Glasnost aspect, to sort of bring in new ideas, clean
                    out some of the old Soviet cobwebs in the corners of their bureaucracy. I mean,
                    they weren't buying a lot of it, but the fact is that Gorbachev wanted these
                    contacts to take place. It was a very important adjunct to the main game, which
                    was the arms control negotiations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We talked about the changing Soviet man. What about within
                        our bureaucracy that you were dealing with? Was there an openness, or were
                        we dealing with a mindset, too? You've already talked about your experience
                        about inspections and all this. I would have thought that by this time we'd
                        had so many of these meetings that people would go in and they'd almost be
                        writing their communiqu� before they got there. I mean the idea that
                        nothing's really changed.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No. That really wasn't so, because by the time we began to have these
                    meetings in Moscow, we were already embarked and making serious progress. You
                    recall the famous Iceland meeting, when Gorbachev... That was another summit, an
                    impromptu kind of summit, when Reagan and Gorbachev nearly wiped away some
                    weapons systems. Nobody really believed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It scared the hell out of people.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: It scared the hell out of people, and Paul Nitze played a major role
                    there. Paul knew that we had to develop more of a base line of understanding in
                    detail before we made those kind of sweeping decisions - and didn't believe it.
                    But things were changing. No, we weren't really writing our communiqu�s before
                    we got there, because it was already a dynamic process, particularly in the INF
                    area. I mean that was quite remarkable tour de force, and that was the first big
                    breakthrough, when Gorbachev came to Washington and sat in the East Room of the
                    White House and signed that treaty. It was just a huge achievement. The
                    following year, when I went to Moscow as part of the delegation for the June,
                    '88, summit, it was almost an anticlimax. It was much more relaxed, and I
                    actually had time to do a little sightseeing, which was wonderful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: With this, you were particularly working on chemical
                        warfare and what else?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0177" n="Page0177"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Back in Washington, in my coordinating role as the chairman of all the
                    arms control negotiations, I was doing all of it, but the sort of special visits
                    to Moscow, which were not scheduled events - I mean, we scheduled them when
                    there was a need, when Shultz, with a lot of advice from Paul Nitze and
                    particularly the negotiators in the field, when Shultz understood that we had
                    reached a plateau and it needed high-level attention to kind of jump start the
                    next level of effort, to move it forward... These were tough negotiations, very
                    difficult issues. When I went on these trips, in my role as the kind of
                    coordinator of the interagency mechanism, I would just volunteer to pick up
                    those portfolios where we didn't have the active negotiations underway, such as
                    in INF and in START, so typically there you had, I can remember, Mike Glitman
                    was doing the INF negotiation at that point, and he would conduct that one,
                    because from his point of view it was another session at a higher level of his
                    ongoing negotiation in Geneva; and on the START front it was - I'm having a hard
                    time with names today.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We can always fill it in later.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, anyway, the START negotiator would also come, obviously, and he
                    would conduct that. So I would just pick up on the other arms control subjects
                    that were not in an advanced stage. I typically worked on chemical weapons and
                    on nuclear testing, which was very rudimentary at that point. I would always
                    invite Ken Edelman, if he was available, as the head of ACDA, if he was not
                    sitting in the INF negotiation or the START negotiation, if he had time, I would
                    invite him always to come and join. This was all part of the strategy of keeping
                    ACDA engaged and a fully participating member in this team effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In nuclear testing, for example - I can't remember; I was
                        talking to somebody, and they were saying, “You've got to remember that for
                        somebody who's been in nuclear testing all their lives, there isn't a hell
                        of a lot else to do.” In other words, if this is a job, this would be true
                        in the Soviet Union as well as in the United States.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Exactly, and I had a DOE counterpart who came on these trips.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You're talking about a highly skilled person from whom
                        you're trying to take away the only chance to use that skill. Could you talk
                        about that a bit - the dealings with the nuclear testing establishment?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0178" n="Page0178"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, you've said it very well. As a matter of fact, one of the things I
                    had to do was to cultivate my assistant secretary counterpart in the Department
                    of Energy, who came out of the National Laboratories and who very much was a
                    stakeholder in that whole process and who didn't like the idea at all that some
                    day we would, perhaps, be doing away with nuclear testing. Actually, the
                    military didn't like it either, and we were nowhere near that point in our
                    discussion with the Soviets, as compared with what has happened in the Clinton
                    Administration on nuclear testing. We were basically just kind of cleaning up
                    the boundaries and narrowing the field and understanding each other. We were not
                    moving towards any kind of a negotiating goal at that juncture - kind of keeping
                    track of each other.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about, while you were doing this, the role of Richard
                        Perle? Could you talk a little bit about him, because he shows up again and
                        again in things?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0179" n="Page0179"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Richard is a brilliant political scientist who became very well known in
                    the early part of the Reagan Administration, while I was in Portugal. During
                    that period, and when Al Haig was Secretary of State, Richard Burt, at that
                    time, was the director of political-military affairs, and people would talk
                    about the “war of the two Richards” because Richard Perle had a new job in the
                    Pentagon. Up until the Reagan Administration, there was one foreign policy
                    bureau or office in the Pentagon, and it was International Security Affairs.
                    Basically, the assistant secretary had the world. It was the state department of
                    the Pentagon, but it was too much for one man, and as we moved into the new era
                    of active arms control, particularly with the Soviet Union, as well as more
                    attention being paid to strategic exports, the export of strategic materials,
                    COCOM, that whole array of things, it became too much for one policy official to
                    handle in the Pentagon, so they created something called assistant secretary for
                    international security policy, and that was primarily to handle all the arms
                    control subjects, the strategic exports - basically the Defense Department's
                    side of munitions control, if you will - and NATO affairs. It took that out of
                    ISA, so basically ISA ended up with the rest of the world, and Richard Perle had
                    this new job. Richard was a brilliant guy, extremely articulate, very
                    conservative, hard-line, very much a Weinberger man, and very skeptical - I mean
                    a very cold Cold War warrior - very skeptical of what the Soviets were up to,
                    deeply skeptical of what the State Department was trying to do. He and Burt
                    tangled a lot. I mean there was a lot of discussion about that in the press. By
                    the time I got to PM, Richard Perle was still there, but the mood and the
                    relationship had changed somewhat. I always had a perfectly decent relationship
                    with him. Occasionally, I may have mentioned earlier in this meeting, we would
                    have our differences, and it was very difficult, particularly when he wasn't
                    around and we were at a critical juncture in developing policy so that the
                    negotiators could move to the next phase, and if Richard was out of town - and
                    he traveled a lot in that role - it was hard to get decisions out of ISP so that
                    we could move forward. But when Richard was there and engaged and you had a
                    chance to really argue through the issues, he made a tremendous contribution.
                    Inevitably, the policy position in the context of the Reagan Administration, was
                    sounder and would stand the test of conservative Congressional scrutiny, press
                    scrutiny. I always liked it when Richard Perle had had a hand in fashioning the
                    position. It was a better piece of policy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about Casper Weinberger? He had sort of the outside
                        reputation of being somebody who would buy anything the Pentagon said. He
                        would represent the military and then would never budge. Did you get that
                        feeling?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, Cap Weinberger was certainly very conservative, and he really
                    believed in the strategic defense initiative, SDI - really believed in it - and
                    Reagan believed in it. I never knew whether Abrahamson really did or not. I told
                    you that Shultz was skeptical but never revealed his skepticism. But because the
                    President and the man that launched it, Cap Weinberger, believed in it, the
                    Soviets believed it, and we spent a lot of money.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0180" n="Page0180"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, God, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: We spent a lot of money on it, and still today, as you know, you can see
                    in Congressional discussions, there is still a sector of the Republican Party
                    that keeps wanting to revive SDI in a major way, not content with just moving
                    forward with theater nuclear missile defense, which is what we've been doing.
                    Now just recently, the Secretary of Defense and the President initiated a $6
                    billion program to explore some of the weapons systems in SDI strategic systems.
                    But Weinberger was very intelligent, very conservative. He tended to get stuck
                    like a broken record, I would notice in meetings, in those Wednesday breakfast
                    meetings, on a position, and he would talk endlessly. I mean, he would just
                    start talking, and you'd hear this long disquisition pour out, and it was always
                    the same formulation in the same order, and it got very boring. It added to his
                    reputation as being stubborn, which he was, and not very reflective, which is
                    not true. Weinberger was a highly intelligent individual and analytical, but
                    when he was defending a position, even though he might have been thinking about
                    other formulations, you got the same treatment every time. That contributed to
                    this reputation, I think, because it was reflected in his demeanor and his way
                    of explaining policy issues when he got on television or talk shows.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I think this might be a good point to stop here, but I'd
                        like to put down some of the questions that I'd like to do. One, we have
                        talked at considerable length about arms control, but we haven't brought it

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: There was one aspect of my work as assistant secretary for
                    political-military affairs working for George Shultz in the Reagan
                    Administration that went beyond coordinating the various arms control groups
                    within the National Security Council system, and that was the NATO subcommittee
                    of the five countries, including ourselves, that had deployed INF systems on
                    their territory - that is to say, Pershing missiles, in Germany and
                    ground-launched Cruise missiles in the other countries.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: Well, there was Italy, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Belgium.

                <p>HOLMES: No, excuse me, start again. Germany, which was primarily the Pershing II
                    missiles; Italy, ground-launched Cruise missiles; England; and the
                    Netherlands.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And Belgium.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, England and the Netherlands. I need to check that, because there were
                    five countries. I guess Belgium was included as well - also ground-launched
                    Cruise missiles - and I can't remember the names of the bases. For example, in
                    the Netherlands there was one base, and there were a couple of places in the
                    United Kingdom. The five nations and ourselves, we met periodically at NATO
                    headquarters to sort of basically iron out problems that came up to keep our
                    group together, to stay very solid and committed to the program, and there were
                    occasionally political problems. I remember at one point the head of the Italian
                    Socialist Party, Bettino Craxi, who had been at one point prime minister, got
                    very nervous during the deployment period, when we were actually deploying these
                    systems, and wanted to suspend deployment. Another time the Belgians had a
                    problem with one of their coalition governments, so we got in the habit of
                    meeting periodically to help each other manage the political fallout in various
                    capitals so that we could keep the program together. Now towards the end of this
                    very tough negotiation on the INF treaty with the Soviets, we were just a few
                    weeks away from signing the treaty in Washington. That as in 1988, when several
                    of our allies in our meeting said that they were having real difficulties in
                    figuring out how they would explain to their respective parliaments that on
                    demand, in accordance with this treaty, Soviet inspectors could come onto their
                    national territory to verify whether or not the US INF missiles were, in fact,
                    being withdrawn on schedule. Some of these countries, particularly the UK, were
                    very concerned about this. They didn't want to go through an elaborate enabling
                    legislative process in their respective parliaments, but they wanted to have an
                    agreement, an ancillary agreement among us, the INF treaty countries, that would
                    satisfy their parliamentary procedures, since they weren't full parties to the
                    treaties in the way that we and the Soviets were. The INF Treaty concerned
                    Soviet and United States systems, but since our systems were on allied
                    territories, they were indirectly also parties to the treaty, although not
                    signatories. So it was complicated. So we spent three or four weeks hammering
                    out an agreement - an inter-government agreement - just amongst ourselves, that
                    would satisfy those parliamentary queries that they knew were coming. That took
                    a lot of work, but we succeeded, and we got it all signed, the foreign ministers
                    all signed, and it was all ready to go on the eve of the signature of the treaty
                    in the White House between Gorbachev and Reagan.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: On the eve of this, when he was asked to sign this as well, I had not
                    bothered him with the details. I just saw this as part of my job of sort of
                    putting together some of the remote pieces of the tapestry of this very
                    important treaty, and he just came up to me and said that he'd heard from a
                    couple of his fellow foreign ministers that this had been a very good effort and
                    he just wanted to give me a little pat on the back for having put something like
                    that together and also for not having to bother him with it.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, yes. It was Greenham Common, but it was near one of the GLCMBs, the
                    ground-launched Cruise missile bases, in England, and they would come and
                    demonstrate periodically. They frequently would camp there for weeks on end,
                    during the good weather, of course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did your British colleagues deal with this, just sort
                        of roll their eyes and accept this, or did they feel it was really
                        important, I mean, of concern?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: It never became a major problem, because after all the United Kingdom was
                    very accustomed, going all the way back to World War II, to having US forces and
                    US Air Forces - after all, the Eighth Air Force was installed in the UK halfway
                    through World War II, and we had a presence there always at RAF bases for many
                    years afterwards. So it wasn't unusual, and you had a sort of a Green-type of
                    protest movement that was very much alive and made noise, and then the British
                    Government would have meetings and explain and put out press releases and talk
                    to the press and sort of kept it in bounds. It never became a major problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, with this arms control - signed in '89, was
                        it, or you had left by '89?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, the INF Treaty was signed in 1987, and then the following spring -
                    I guess it was June of 1988 - we all went to Moscow. I may be mistaken here. The
                    INF Treaty signature may have been in December of 1987. It was in Washington, in
                    the White House, and then that was the treaty ceremony where Reagan and
                    Gorbachev sort of joshed each other a bit with Reagan quoting the Russian phrase
                    which means, basically, “verify and then trust.” And Gorbachev laughing and
                    saying, “You always say that to me.”</p>
                <pb facs="0184" n="Page0184"/>
                <p>The following spring, in June of '88, there was a return visit by President
                    Reagan to Moscow, and some other activities in the arms control arena were
                    undertaken. There were some things that were signed there that were of less
                    significance. The INF Treaty was a major moment in our series of arms control
                    reductions, and of course the START came later, as did the Chemical Warfare
                    Treaty, which happened in the Bush Administration.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left this job when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I left this job in approximately March or April of 1989. Basically what
                    happened - and this was sort of interesting - was that even after the election
                    of George Bush in November of 1988 (the Reagan Administration, of course, was
                    still in office), Shultz readily agreed to a French proposal to hold a
                    conference in the first 10 days - I can't remember the exact dates, but it was
                    approximately during the first 10 days - of January in Paris, to which about 150
                    countries in the world were invited. This was a global conference, and it was
                    basically an attempt to stuff the chemical warfare genie back in the bottle. We
                    had a convention signed in 1925 as a result of the use of gas in World War I, to
                    basically ban chemical weapons forever; and other than the Italian use of gas
                    against the Ethiopians in what must have been about 1937 or '38 in that
                    campaign, the 1925 convention banning the use of chemical weapons was observed
                    throughout World War II, and it wasn't until the Iranians were fighting the
                    Iraqis in the early '80s and pushing Iraqi troops back into Iraq, out of the
                    Shatt al-Arab, that the Iraqis got so desperate that they got to the point where
                    they actually uncorked the bottle and used nerve gas against the Iranians and
                    against their own people, against Iraqi Kurds, who, of course, weren't exactly
                    sympathetic to the Iraqi cause. The famous Halabja incident occurred, where
                    there was a massive attack on this one town, and it killed a lot of Iraqi Kurds,
                    a lot of the population, and there were horrible photographs. I remember there
                    were hearings about that afterwards, and I testified. The Congress was basically
                    trying to place responsibility as to how this could possibly have happened, and
                    what were the consequences, and what were we going to do about chemical warfare,
                    and so forth.</p>
                <p>So the French had this concept of pulling together the world community and trying
                    at least to freeze the use of chemical weapons, if not to patch up the 1925
                    convention, pending a more permanent treaty, the negotiation of which was
                    underway and took a very long time. We agreed to do that, and Shultz agreed to
                    go to the conference, and our delegation, when George Shultz wasn't there, was
                    led by William Burns, who had been my senior deputy in PM and who had been asked
                    by the Administration in the last eight months or so of the Reagan
                    Administration to retire from the Army and become head of ACDA, to replace Ken
                    Edelman, which he did. He led the team, and I ended up, with that, as his
                    deputy, which was a lot of fun. We were very close.</p>
                <pb facs="0185" n="Page0185"/>
                <p>We had some tough negotiations. We came out with a very good communiqu�, which
                    basically pledged the participants to contain the use of chemical weapons. We
                    had, I remember, an all-nighter with a group of about 20 countries that were the
                    so-called friends of the chairman, and I was the lead negotiator in that. We
                    went all night, and it was exceedingly difficult because the Iranians, the
                    Iraqis, the Libyans, and a few other countries who were very suspicious of the-
                    (end of tape)</p>
                <p>This collection of the Middle Eastern countries that were implacable enemies of
                    Israel wanted to hold us up basically on the question of chemical weapons to
                    bring in a pledge on the part of the Israelis, who were also at the conference,
                    to forswear the use of nuclear weapons before they would sign up to language in
                    this communiqu�. So we went on all night, and basically with the assistance of
                    Mike Matheson, who was the senior legal advisor from the State Department, he
                    and I just adopted a tactic of hard line. We just placed ourselves way over at
                    the right and adopted the Soviet posture of nyet [Russian: no]. The Soviet
                    delegation was completely in our court, but told us very frankly they wouldn't
                    lift a finger to help us, but that they would go along with us. So they just sat
                    on their hands during this long night's struggle. Eventually the French, as the
                    hosts, came along with us, and we got closer and closer, and finally about four
                    o'clock in the morning, we got the language that we needed for the communiqu�.
                    The next morning when this was reported back to heads of delegation, to
                    ministers, the French chief delegate got into a lot of trouble with his
                    minister, who, as the host, felt that they were too much on our side of the
                    argument and not acting as a neutral host. But we managed to get over that as
                    well, and naturally the conference turned out quite well and was a pretty good
                    platform, as it turned out (this is what Shultz wanted, this communiqu� and this
                    sort of pretty firm pledge on the part of the world community to do something
                    serious about containing the use of chemical weapons), good platform for the
                    four-year struggle that was about to begin under the Bush Administration to
                    conclude a workable, verifiable chemical arms treaty.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: Yes, gas - mustard gas, but more importantly, the very lethal series of

                    Iraqis much more than the Iranians, but the two of them together, against each
                    other, had done this. The Libyans had not, but they had developed an enormous
                    chemical weapons complex, which we knew all about. That was before they actually
                    went underground at Tarhuna, which happened later. The Libyans had a big
                    complex, and of course the Soviets had the biggest stockpile - bigger than ours,
                    which was considerable - of chemical weapons in the world. The various other
                    countries had them. There were probably 20-25 countries, because the Arab
                    countries, we always used to refer to it as the poor man's weapon of mass
                    destruction. Obviously, to produce usable nuclear weapons required an enormous
                    infrastructure and an investment that most of these countries - with exceptions
                    we found out later of Iraq - couldn't afford.</p>
                <p>By that time the Israelis had for psychological reasons, allowed it to be known
                    without ever admitting it, that they had a stockpile of nuclear weapons, and so
                    the Arabs were trying to work a pledge from them on the non-use of nuclear
                    weapons into the equation; and of course we didn't go along with that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now did the Israelis go along with limiting chemical

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, they did. They were delighted that we were able to protect their

                <p>HOLMES: China went along with this as well, and of course they maintained a
                    fiction, which was that they had never had chemical weapons, that they had been
                    the victim of the use of chemical weapons in experimentation by the Japanese. At
                    least that's what the Chinese told me when we had our first ever
                    political-military discussions with the Chinese in November of 1988, which was a
                    very interesting trip that one of my deputies in the Political Military Bureau,
                    Vladimir Lehovich, and I went to, went to Beijing and had two days of talks, not
                    knowing beforehand what the agenda would be because the Chinese wouldn't tell
                    us. But we were willing to go on that basis, and we had a rather thorough,
                    although I would call it Pol-Mil 101... But it was a beginning. These were
                    official talks on political-military subjects, and we did talk about weapons of
                    mass destruction and chemical warfare, and actually not too long after that,
                    Tiananmen Square happened, and of course that put a freeze on our relationship
                    for some years after that. But that was sort of an interesting early beginning,
                    and I do recall from those discussions the Chinese being at pains to say that
                    they had been the victims of Japanese use of chemical weapons and also
                    experimentation.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: They mentioned Manchuria to us. They didn't talk about this particular
                    unit, but they said that there had been incidents in Manchuria by the Japanese
                    against their people. Now they also denied that they had chemical weapons
                    production facility and capacity, which was not true. I mean, they had a small
                    one, but it was very much alive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This brings up a question. You say “Pol-Mil 101,” which
                        for the person who might be reading this in the 25th century, 101 is the
                        designation for an introductory course in a university. But was there a
                        development of a pol-mil collegial group, essentially civilians and military
                        throughout sort of the diplomatic community who were knowledgeable?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, absolutely.</p>
                <p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0188" n="Page0188"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, I was, and that was very interesting, that development, that
                    evolution of cadres of diplomats and military officers who were specializing in
                    and had chosen, for various reasons, to concentrate on the political-military
                    aspects of diplomacy. That process was well underway by the time I got to the
                    Political-Military Bureau in 1985. It had been growing, basically, since World
                    War II. Generally speaking in the Foreign Service, the political-military
                    specialty was a sub-specialization in the political cone. But similar skills
                    were displayed by our fellow diplomats in the United Kingdom, in France, in the
                    Federal Republic, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Israel.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Israel I'm not so sure, but certainly among our allies this was very,
                    very clear, certainly among all of our NATO allies, because they tended to
                    rotate in and out of assignments, just as we did, in their NATO delegations,
                    plus the international staff, both the civilian and the military international
                    staff of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. By the same token, in our own
                    military, there was a pol-mil specialty. You had the foreign area specialists,
                    who generally, in the military, peopled the DIA and were attach�s who
                    specialized in regions of the world and languages. They used to call themselves
                    “pol-mil weenies;” they loved this kind of work. I mean they loved having
                    assignments to the State Department, mostly to the Political-Military Bureau,
                    but indeed there were officers in all the geographic bureaus and in the
                    international staff of NATO and in our delegation. So there was basically also a
                    career pattern in the armed services that was also pol-mil. So by the mid-'80s,
                    and particularly with the growth in arms control negotiations, these were fairly
                    robust cadres of officers, and some of them became extremely specialized in arms
                    control, both in the civilians and the military. Now the most skillful... There
                    was literally a handful of brilliant military officers who tended to come out of
                    the missile community, who were frequently physicists, who were familiar with
                    the basic vocabulary and the formulas - you know, throw weight and reentry
                    vehicles and the yields of various kinds of weapons. It was just second-nature
                    to them. These kinds of officers were invaluable to our teams that were
                    negotiating with the Soviets, and also we had a few civilians, people like Jim
                    Timbie, who was a nuclear physicist and who had been at the right hand of Paul
                    Nitze and George Shultz and then later worked with Jim Baker on these very
                    complex arms control discussions.</p>
                <pb facs="0189" n="Page0189"/>
                <p>I should mention one other footnote here, and that is the Missile Technology
                    Control R�gime. This was something that was negotiated approximately between
                    1985 and 1988. It took about four years. It was not a treaty; it was not an
                    inter-government agreement; it was a “political understanding.” It was the joint
                    undertaking of like-minded countries. It grew out of the Group of Seven, the
                    seven major industrial countries that would meet periodically - the United
                    States, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Italy, Canada, and Japan. It was
                    born out of that group approximately in 1985, and there was an office in the
                    Bureau of Political-Military Affairs that was negotiating this at the level of
                    office director. It went on for the longest time. It took four years, or
                    three-plus years. Extremely difficult because to get countries to agree to
                    control their strategic technology, to control not only missiles but also the
                    most sensitive components of missiles and the precursors of the physics
                    warheads, the physics packages of nuclear warheads that we placed on these
                    missiles. This was finally concluded, and I used to keep Secretary Shultz
                    abreast of this. During my 15-minute meeting that I would have with him every
                    week, I would occasionally tell him how we were coming on this, and he would
                    listen but not ask too many questions. I recall at a certain point, when we were
                    very close to signing this at the level of foreign ministers, and when the
                    larger, the more important arms control negotiations such as INF and START were
                    going badly with the Soviets and the Reagan Administration needed a shot in the
                    arm, I remember Shultz saying to me, “By the way, how's that
                    what-do-you-call-it, MTCR outfit coming along?” and I said, “Well, as a matter
                    of fact, we're very close; we'll probably be finished in a few weeks and be
                    ready for signature.” He said, “Oh, that's great. This will be an achievement
                    that we can point to while some of our other negotiations are on a plateau and
                    not moving right.”</p>
                <p>Of course, this grew later, in subsequent administrations, into a much bigger
                    program and turned out to be one of the most important later on and although not
                    a treaty, became one of the most important mechanisms among countries to control
                    the export of sensitive technology that could be used to manufacture missiles
                    and nuclear weapons.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Back to the cadre, about pol-mil. Did the Soviets seem to
                        have the equivalent? In other words, were you all kind of seeing old friends
                        or old adversaries or what have you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0190" n="Page0190"/>
                <p>HOLMES: My answer to that is yes and no. I would say that among the older
                    generation, my generation and older, of Soviet diplomats, it wasn't so much that
                    they were pol-mil people, but there were more a handful of arms control
                    specialists. But I think I mentioned it in an earlier interview that when Eduard
                    Shevardnadze became foreign minister and took over basically when Gorbachev came
                    in and took up what Gromyko had done for many years, he basically cleaned house.
                    He decapitated a generation of Soviet diplomats in the pol-mil/arms control
                    specialty area and brought in a whole new cadre of young officers in their 30s
                    and their 40s, many of whom we did know. They had made it their business to get
                    to know Americans, to learn English, to learn American jokes, and had a much
                    easier relationship with Americans. There wasn't this sort of hostile posturing
                    on the part of Cold Warriors that we'd been accustomed to. In that group there
                    was certainly what you could identify as a new generation of pol-mil arms
                    control specialists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Sort of jumping around, but back to China. Let's talk a
                        bit about this trip. How did it come about, and how was it put on, and what
                        were you up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, basically it came about as a way of... This, again, is a little
                    side-show that I was interested in developing. I was interested in getting into
                    a conversation with the Chinese foreign minister in Beijing about
                    political-military subjects in general and arms control in particular. It was
                    kind of an experiment. After one of the sessions that we had had in Moscow with
                    the Soviets, I asked - of course, I asked Secretary Shultz's permission to do
                    this - in addition to the debriefings that we always gave to the Eastern
                    Europeans and obviously to our NATO allies first and foremost, I suggested that,
                    since there were talks (it was during the annual General Assembly discussions in
                    New York), why don't I offer to debrief the Chinese and see what this yields? He
                    agreed that that was a good idea. I gave them a very tailored briefing, and you
                    could tell they were extremely interested, to finally be sort of - even on the
                    margins - to be brought into this arms control game. I didn't make it
                    conditional or anything; I just suggested at the end of this, “You know, we
                    could continue this and have more regular sessions from time to time if, in
                    response to this, you might invite us to Beijing for talks.” It took a very long
                    time for them to clear that with their elaborate bureaucracy in Beijing, but
                    finally in about 60 days, the reply came in, and they said they would be pleased
                    to see us, but they wouldn't tell us what the agenda would be. We would learn
                    that when we got there. Vlad Lehovich and I packed our bags, and we had some
                    discussions that we had to do anyway about that time with the Australians, and
                    so that made a kind of a packaged trip possible. We went off to Beijing. It was
                    very interesting.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0191" n="Page0191"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, they were interested in some very basic things - the workings of
                    the National Security Council, the systems. I gave them - again, to use the
                    phrase 101 - I gave them “NSC 101”; I went back to the 1947 act and described
                    the setting up of the National Security Council system right after World War II,
                    the membership, the staff, how we operated, the range of political-military and
                    arms control subjects, as well as diplomatic subjects, that were treated in that
                    forum. We had nothing to hide. I laid it out for them. They were fascinated. It
                    was very clear to me that what the Foreign Ministry had in mind was to sort of
                    insert themselves, infiltrate, if you will, the military apparatus of the
                    People's Liberation Army. I mean, they were frozen out. They didn't have pol-mil
                    discussions, because the Chinese military didn't want their civilian diplomats
                    mucking around in their terrain, and so they were clearly using this, using our
                    model, as a way of persuading the Central Committee and the Chinese military
                    that it was time for them to put together a modern government apparatus that
                    covered the range of subjects. They used our model as a way of trying to
                    persuade the Chinese military to adopt a different system, but they also were
                    suggesting that as a result of this there might be more military sales and
                    opportunities to augment the Chinese military's budget - which, in fact, turned
                    out to be true later.</p>
                <p>That was their primary interest, but in the process, we learned a lot about them.
                    It was a beginning of conversations, and had we not had the interruption in our
                    relationship of Tiananmen Square, I think we would have evolved into having
                    regular discussions, probably once a year and later, if it turned out to
                    valuable for both sides, more frequently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you go into the interchange of military and State
                        within the Pentagon and State Department and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, yes, we explained all of that, and they were absolutely fascinated.
                    They had no idea. They really were, I think, very surprised by the extent of
                    cooperation and coordination among career Foreign Service officers and career
                    military officers. They had no idea that this was going on, and they obviously
                    liked the idea very much.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: War Colleges and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: We explained all of that, the War College system.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the fact that we exchange with War Colleges, the State
                        Department.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0192" n="Page0192"/>
                <p>HOLMES: So I explained all that, and we also explained how we negotiated with the
                    Soviets, and the kinds of teams that we put together and the way George Shultz,
                    as the leader of our arms control effort in the Reagan Administration, was
                    always careful to bring the entire NSC system - OSD, JCS, NSC, Department of
                    Energy - the whole gang would always accompany him on these trips, and how the
                    presence and the blessing of the JCS was so important to our delegation, and we
                    had discovered that the counterpart system in the Soviet Union was also very
                    important. It was very important for Shevardnadze to have Marshal Akhromeyev at
                    his side when they were about to make serious steps in our arms control
                    negotiations. That part fascinated the Chinese as well. I think they probably
                    knew a little bit more about the inner workings of the Soviet system than ours,
                    but I explained it all to them and tried to draw them out, suggesting to them
                    that we needed to be concerned about the development of weapons of mass
                    destruction across the board.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that, because of recent history,
                        Henry Kissinger, who didn't play this game at all, would have come up. Did
                        Henry Kissinger come up as a subject, or did you bring him up and say he was
                        atypical?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, not really. But we weren't dealing at a very senior level. I mean
                    let's be clear. I think maybe the most senior person I talked to was an
                    assistant minister of foreign affairs, and there must have been probably four or
                    five of them in their foreign affairs ministry. So we never got any higher than
                    sort of my equivalent in their structure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about during this period dealing with
                        political-military, did Taiwan come up?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0193" n="Page0193"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Taiwan would come up periodically, usually during the annual visit by a
                    delegation of Taiwanese who would come to Washington every year, sometimes twice
                    a year. You know, under the Taiwan relations act, we didn't have diplomatic
                    relations with Taiwan. That was part of the complex of agreements that came out
                    of Nixon's visit to China and the Shanghai communiqu� and so forth. We
                    constructed this elaborate fiction that we had a sort of corporate business
                    relationship, and so the heads of our delegations in Taiwan were career
                    diplomats, like Harry Thayer, for example, who would actually go through the
                    motions of getting out of the Foreign Service - although the clock kept ticking
                    on their benefits and so forth - but we were very careful not to call these
                    people “ambassadors,” not to call our mission there a “diplomatic mission,”
                    which it wasn't. We were, by procedure, forbidden from sending senior officials
                    to Taiwan. So as I recall it, we didn't even go to visit Taiwan at the level of
                    deputy assistant secretary. I think the senior level that we were allowed to
                    visit Taiwan was at the sort of office director level. Of course the Taiwanese
                    didn't like that, and they would come at whatever level they chose, and they
                    would come to Washington, and basically they would be visiting the State
                    Department and the Defense Department and the NSC in search of better military
                    equipment, and coming out of the Shanghai Communiqu� was an agreement to
                    basically freeze the quantity and the sophistication of military hardware at the
                    level that then existed. But with the passage of time and the degradation of
                    that equipment, they would come every year and argue that we should allow a new
                    model of the F-16 or whatever the aircraft or the artillery piece or the counter
                    battery artillery control system might be. This was always a big argument, and
                    we did inch up. We did allow, after the passage of two or three years, a
                    slightly more sophisticated version or a new model of this piece of equipment or
                    that. And when that happened, of course they made no secret of it, and then we
                    would always get complaints from the Foreign Ministry in Beijing that we were
                    violating or that we were getting close to violating - we'd better be careful -
                    the Shanghai agreements. So this was a constant flow of argument back and forth
                    between us and Taiwan.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there during the - well, no, you wouldn't have
                        been. The elections with sending more F-16s to Taiwan came during the
                        Bush-Clinton thing, and you were out then.</hi>
                </p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Iran-Iraq War. You've mentioned the
                        chemical warfare, but were there any other elements during the time you were
                        doing this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0194" n="Page0194"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Not much. There was not very much of significance, but what did - and I
                    should mention this - was my responsibility as the co-chairman of the Joint
                    Political-Military Group with Israel. This was a very interesting enterprise. We
                    met at least twice a year with the Israelis, and we had kind of an odd
                    arrangement. The assistant secretary for political-military affairs teamed with
                    the director general of the Ministry of Defense in Israel. They were the
                    co-chairs. We would meet every six months at a minimum in Washington and then
                    the following meeting would be in Tel Aviv. This as put together basically to
                    have a structured political-military dialogue and to set up, monitor, and
                    control the pacing of military exercises. We had to be careful, because of our
                    relationships with Arab countries in the immediate proximity, and we were always
                    very careful that our military always dealt with the IDF, the Israeli Defense
                    Force, through the European command, whereas all the surrounding Arab countries
                    dealt with the Department of Defense through the central command, to keep them
                    separate.</p>
                <p>We had various agreements. We had stockpiling agreements. The Israelis were
                    always, of course, interested in getting more, and again it was a question of
                    quantity and sophistication, and they wanted them basically as sort of a
                    strategic reserve for their armed forces, in case there should be another war.
                    We wanted them there as a dual purpose stockpile, so that we could also draw on
                    them, and we had various logistical and budgetary and congressional reasons for
                    setting it up that way. That always took a lot of discussion. We also had
                    increasingly more sophisticated and ambitious exercises. Sometimes out of this
                    came the ability to use Israeli territory for unilateral exercises, and
                    particularly for firing ranges. That was very important for us, and the European
                    command liked that because with the increasing prosperity in Germany, for
                    example, and less and less farmland becoming available for maneuvers and
                    particularly for firing ranges, our people had to really be creative in finding
                    good places to train, for night-flying, for firing ranges, and that sort of
                    thing. So we were very pleased to be able to have Israeli desert facilities to
                    train in. We also had bilateral exercises, and we would start with “passexes,”
                    passing exercises, basically when an American contingent of ships, a couple of
                    destroyers and a cruiser and a submarine or two would be maneuvering part of the
                    fleet in the Mediterranean in the eastern Mediterranean, this was an opportunity
                    maybe to have a passing exercise. While they were more or less abreast of
                    Israeli territory, the Israelis would have a little exercise. Frequently they
                    would send out one or two of their little diesel submarines, and they would play
                    cat and mouse games with our destroyers. Once in a while they eluded our people,
                    and of course that was cause for great national pride. And then we had some
                    small landings together, a battalion of Marines off of the Sixth Fleet would
                    land, and they would maneuver with the Israeli Navy and their equivalent forces,
                    and we monitored that and we grew that process under the sort of careful
                    supervision of the co-chairs. And of course I had people from the Defense
                    Department on our team, the NSC.</p>
                <pb facs="0195" n="Page0195"/>
                <p>One of the things that I introduced into that, and that was a very interesting
                    forum, one of the things I wanted to do was to get - again since we were very
                    much into weapons of mass destruction, I knew I wouldn't get anyplace on nuclear
                    weapons, so I never even tried, but on the question of chemical weapons, we
                    tried... It took us a couple of years, almost a year and a half, two years, to
                    get the Israelis to agree to discuss chemical weapons. We finally got their
                    attention when Dick Clark, who was then deputy assistant secretary of INR and
                    who was a great briefer and a highly intelligent officer, came with us on one
                    trip, and we gave a briefing to then Defense Minister Rabin, which really got
                    his attention, because they were struggling with the fact that their own
                    intelligence had not been able to keep track of the Syrian development of binary
                    chemical weapons. Binary weapons are those where the elements of the weapon are
                    kept separate in basically non-lethal, inert, harmless stages, and they only
                    would come together to form a lethal weapon in the warhead as it was moving in
                    flight towards its target. The Syrians had been able to get a lot of these
                    weapons from the Soviets, and they had stockpiled them in places that the
                    Israelis hadn't discovered, and they were getting very, very worried about this
                    capability. Why? because the entire Israeli strategy for survival depended on
                    their ability to, one, put their air force aloft very quickly at the beginning
                    of a war or maybe even preempt by a few hours to get immediate control of the
                    airspace, which would then allow them to mobilize their ground forces in the 24
                    to 48 hours that followed. With them not having exact information on where and
                    in what quantity the Syrians had binary chemical weapons strapped on short-range
                    missiles (300-400 mile range) this could have absolutely destroyed their
                    capability, because even though they might have had air superiority during the
                    mobilization stage, barrages of these chemical weapons could have terrorized
                    their population and made mobilization extremely difficult. They were very
                    concerned.</p>
                <p>I remember this particular briefing. Dick Clark gave a superb briefing on
                    chemical weapons capabilities. Rabin was very interested, was very engaged in
                    this discussion, and he allowed us then to get into discussions of the control
                    of chemical and, eventually, biological weapons with the Israelis. We kind of
                    broke the ice with them on this, and we were able to make that then -
                    particularly chemical weapons - a regular feature of our embryonic arms control
                    discussions with the Israelis.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: At your level did politics intrude, because everything
                        with Israel ends up by being domestically political? Did you find that
                        intruded there at all?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0196" n="Page0196"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Not really. I'll tell you, we were dealing with Israeli professionals,
                    professional military and diplomats, but basically we were dealing with the
                    Israeli Defense Force and with their Foreign Ministry. Mendi Meron was my first
                    counterpart. Then afterwards my next counterpart on the Israeli side waDavid
                    Ivry - the former commander of the Israeli Air Force who had led the Israeli
                    raid on Osirak, the nuclear facility that the French had built for the Iraqis,
                    which was a very daring raid several years before. These people were
                    professionals, and I met them in later years, and it was very different from
                    operating in a political arena. The only time I was ever aware of the politics
                    of the Israeli-US relationship was during Israeli visits to Washington, when at
                    the inevitable Israeli ambassador's dinner there would be AIPAC members there,
                    at the dinner, and members of Congress who had big Jewish constituencies. Then
                    in discussion at those dinners it was very clear that there was a political
                    aspect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, on the pol-mil side, was there any discomfort about
                        the amount of equipment that was going to Israel, particularly from our
                        military people?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, there certainly was in terms of the budget. Now for some years, our
                    military assistance budget had been growing, and one of the things that we did
                    during the time that I was there, between 1985 and 1989, is we capped the
                    military assistance budget, which was at that point, I think, $1.8 billion and
                    still is pretty much at that level, although it's beginning to change now. But
                    the entire US Government budget for Israel was about three billion, as I recall
                    - about $1.8 billion military assistance and about $1.2 billion in economic
                    support funds.</p>
                <p>We never directly felt the political pressure. We only felt it indirectly. But
                    there was a struggle there in maintaining that cap. We basically flatlined the
                    budget from year to year and stayed at $1.8 billion. Now the Israelis are very
                    resourceful, and they were undeterred by this, although they didn't like it. But
                    they would do things like at a certain point - and I can't remember what year it
                    happened - they made a separate arrangement with the Congress, and this is where
                    the politics played. They made a separate arrangement where, unlike other
                    countries in the world that we provided assistance to quarter by quarter, they
                    made an arrangement to receive the entire year's donation at the beginning of
                    the fiscal year, so that they could then bank it and earn interest on it. So
                    that was a compensation. They also had allowed a certain amount of counterpart
                    sales. In other words, yes, there was a “buy American” provision, but in the
                    process of concluding various agreements with American exporters and
                    manufacturers, then they had to buy a certain percentage of the sale, they would
                    have to purchase some Israeli exports. There was a certain amount of that
                    offshore procurement. They were able through various mechanisms to make the most
                    of the situation while struggling to break that cap, which at least in the four
                    years that I was there they were not able to do.</p>
                <pb facs="0197" n="Page0197"/>
                <p>We did occasionally have problems on the provision of technology. Any time we
                    sold or loaned, gave or what have you, equipment to the Israeli Defense Force,
                    we had a string, and it was always part of the agreement, on the re-export of
                    this American technology. In other words, they understood that we were giving
                    them top of the line technology and that they had to control it and that we
                    would be watching and we would not permit the resale unless they asked us. Very
                    old equipment or equipment that might be obsolescent, we might after review
                    allow them to sell to third countries. They pretty much abided by that. But we
                    began to have a problem in the relationship when at a certain point they would
                    take some critical component of a defense system and remove it and then develop
                    it and then place it in something constructed by Israeli defense industries and
                    then sell it - as to the Chinese. We had problems with their sales. They were
                    developing a huge relationship with China at that time. They were selling them a
                    lot of equipment, and in return for that, they got political diplomatic support
                    from the Chinese in a lot of places. Of course, they were very pleased to have
                    relations with them, and they eschewed the relationship with Taiwan. But we had
                    some difficult discussions with the Israelis at that time when there were these
                    sort of indirect sales of US-controlled equipment, which they argued was no
                    longer US equipment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, did the Pollard case develop during this? I
                        can't remember when it was, but he was an American who spied for Israel, and
                        it's still a controversial case because he gave a hell of a lot of
                        information, which apparently even got into the Soviet Union, or at least
                        there are allegations. Did that develop when you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, it didn't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we at all concerned about Israel and it's relations
                        with the Soviet Union? Because they were playing another game with the
                        Soviets, and that was to try to get more Jews out of the Soviet Union, and
                        some of the cards they would play might be military. Was that of concern to
                        us at that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, actually, I don't recall it as something that came up, and of course
                    we were very supportive, as national policy, which was a bipartisan policy,
                    basically, supportive of the release of Soviet Jews by the Soviet Union,
                    allowing them to come to the United States or go to Israel. Remember the
                    Jackson-Vanik Amendment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But my question was - one of the things that the Israelis
                        had was quite sophisticated military equipment.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: That didn't come up. The Israelis developed some very sophisticated
                    equipment for use in their theater, their tank - Merkava?-</p>
                <pb facs="0198" n="Page0198"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Merkava, I think it was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes - was their tank, which was very sophisticated, and they had special
                    laminated body armor, which was similar to what we had and what the Soviets had,
                    and so that wasn't an issue. They had the armament they needed. The Soviets were
                    a world-class military force. They put the lion's share of their budget into
                    their defense program and their space program, and the finest and the brightest
                    young Soviet engineers and scientists and industrial designers went to those two
                    programs, so other than an occasional little piece of equipment here and there,
                    it was not major drawing card for the Soviets. It was basically mostly a US
                    struggle - and we really acted on behalf of Israel in arguing that the Soviets
                    should allow, for human rights reasons, Soviet Jews who wanted to emigrate and
                    go to Israel or come to the United States to allow it to happen, and we worked
                    very hard at that. They're still coming, today. I mean, I was reading the other
                    day, quite extraordinary, there's a new influx of Russian Jews going into
                    Israel, today, and they're now, apparently, the biggest single ethnic group in
                    Israel. They outnumber the Ashkenazim and the Sephardim.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, in '89, you're time had come to an end there, and
                        what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0199" n="Page0199"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, in '89, I was asked by the incoming Baker group, the Bush
                    Administration, by the undersecretary for management, who was in charge of
                    personnel, who came to me and said that they wanted to send me as ambassador to
                    Brazil. I had, of course the Portuguese language background, and I would have
                    been very interested to do so, but my wife's medical situation did not permit
                    another foreign assignment, so I declined that opportunity. Congress had passed
                    new legislation setting up an ambassador-at-large for burdensharing. This was an
                    initiative calculated to put a senior person into that job who would report to
                    the Secretary of State and who would basically work very hard with our allies to
                    increase their share in the costs involved in stationing American forces in
                    their countries and in their regions. There was a feeling in the Congress that
                    the allies were getting a free ride - this was a global view - and that we were
                    paying far too much for their defense. So they created this position, and then
                    leaned on the new Administration to fill it. Larry Eagleburger, who was then
                    deputy secretary of state, asked me to drop by and asked me take on this job. He
                    thought it was a very important job, that he and Baker wanted me to do it, that
                    they would give me whatever resources I wanted. He said money is no object - up
                    to a certain point. I could create a staff, I could hire 12, 15, 20 people,
                    whatever I needed to set this office up and make it work. So I agreed to take
                    the job. It seemed like the kind of job that I would enjoy doing. I had the NATO
                    background; I'd had a lot of experience working with the Defense Department by
                    that point; and I liked, you know, the idea of creating something new. But I
                    told Larry that I didn't want to create a staff. If I created a competing
                    bureaucracy, I wouldn't get the cooperation, either of the parts of the State
                    Department that I would have to deal with, but more importantly the Defense
                    Department and the commands in Japan and Korea and Europe. They would see this
                    as somehow threatening. So I said I would limit my office to my secretary and
                    one military officer, who was working in the Pol-Mil Bureau and who wanted to
                    come join me. He was one of those pol-mil “weenies” I told you about. He had a
                    Ph. D. in political science and loved that kind of work and volunteered to come,
                    so that's the way I set it up - my secretary and one officer. My decision turned
                    out to be the right one, because I never had any problem. In fact, I had a lot
                    of cooperation throughout, in the JCS, in ISA, US Forces Japan, US Forces Korea,
                    the NATO delegation. I had tremendous cooperation. In fact, I spent, I would
                    say, 85 percent of my time working with the defense establishment out of the
                    State Department. It was a wonderful job. I had to learn to do things in a
                    different way. I had a small - Yes, excuse me.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I want to get the dates. You were there from '89 to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I was there from '89 to '93.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought you would have shied away from the
                        job, because it sounds as if you were the “designated nag” to go
                        around-</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0200" n="Page0200"/>
                <p>HOLMES: “Pickpocket” is more the word. I mean, that's what I did. I went around
                    and picked allied pockets.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: To be doing this all the time sounds like either a glutton
                        for punishment or you have a certain amount of Sadomasochism built into you
                        or something.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I liked it because it was a challenge. It was something new, something
                    that I would create, I would set the pattern for. I thought it was a lot of
                    fun.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you give me sort of a tour of the horizon of how you
                        viewed the situation as regards your particular work, I mean burdensharing,
                        with our allies at that point, in '89 when you took it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I sort of surveyed the landscape. I made my calls, including calling on
                    the Secretary of Defense, on Dick Cheney, who immediately invited me to travel
                    with him. He said, “When you start this job, I want you to come with me so I can
                    introduce you at the appropriate levels so we can get some things done.” I
                    basically initially looked at three sectors. I looked at Japan first and
                    foremost - that was the big prize, and that was where I felt we could get a lot
                    of help - Korea and our NATO allies. The NATO allies I knew would be the most
                    difficult, and of course it was a little unfair of the Congress to talk about
                    them shirking and not doing their part because, in fact, the NATO allies,
                    through various mechanisms, were already contributing a lot to the common
                    defense.</p>
                <p>I started in Asia, because that was the area I knew the least, and my learning
                    curve was going to be a lot steeper there. I had never worked with either the
                    Japanese or the republic of Korea, the ROKs, and so I spent a lot of time
                    preparing for my first mission with those two countries. There was a lot of
                    research and a lot of meetings in Washington talking to people that were
                    knowledgeable about it, and I found that I had a great welcome over in the
                    Defense Department. I started, as I say, in 1989, and it was in 1990, of course,
                    that Saddam invaded Kuwait. It was the summer, wasn't it?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was in August.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: August of 1990.</p>

                <pb facs="0201" n="Page0201"/>
                <p>HOLMES: So that was sort of an important point in my negotiations with the
                    Japanese, but I will come to that. I spent basically that first year laying the
                    groundwork, making my calls, going with the new Secretary of Defense on visits.
                    I went with him to Japan and Korea and Europe. I always went with him; for every
                    meeting of defense ministers at NATO, I went with him. He would always have me
                    seated next to him, and it really made a big difference to be able to do it that
                    way. He always made a joke about it, particularly with the Japanese and Koreans,
                    that I was Jim Baker's spy, but it was extremely helpful, not only with senior
                    Japanese and Koreans, but also, frankly, with senior US military in the
                    commands, because they saw, because of his body language and introduction, that
                    he felt this was an important task. It really made my life a lot easier.</p>
                <pb facs="0202" n="Page0202"/>
                <p>It took a lot of work, for example with the Japanese, looking at the range. I
                    visited our facilities throughout Japan, which were extensive, studied the
                    cost-sharing arrangements that we already had to identify areas where this could
                    be improved upon, and obviously also the agreements that we had - the
                    status-of-forces agreement and our treaty with the Japanese and the Koreans.
                    Generally I had a lot of help always in Japan from Mike Armacost, who was our
                    ambassador there. I was a friend. He always invited me to stay with him. He
                    didn't always take me around, but he would introduce me, and the deputy chief of
                    mission helped me, as did their pol-mil officer and the three-star commander of
                    US Forces Japan. So we became a team. This was a very exciting enterprise, and
                    the Japanese were very courteous. It was always a little difficult negotiating
                    with the Japanese, because I had to sort of talk separately to the Ministry of
                    Foreign Affairs and the Defense Ministry - what do they call it? - the
                    Self-Defense Agency. But these were always separate discussions, and the
                    important discussions were with the Finance Ministry, but I tried to eschew
                    direct discussions with them. It thought it was important to deal with the
                    diplomats and the military. They were not very good at coordinating amongst
                    themselves. I thought for a while that they were using me, that they were
                    playing against each other as a way of resisting my entreaties. That was only
                    partly true. As I later discovered, the Japanese basically detest confrontation,
                    whether it's with another country or with another bureaucracy in their own
                    government. They avoid it if at all possible. These discussions took a very long
                    time. But after about, oh, several visits - I guess I'd been at it for about six
                    months - in August of 1990, after Saddam invaded Kuwait and it was very clear
                    that we were going to go to war against Iraq and eject Iraq from Kuwait and we
                    were developing this huge force - and we asked the Japanese to join, and we knew
                    of course that they would not provide combat forces, that was out of the
                    question, they were prevented by their constitution - but we had hoped that they
                    would give us some logistical support, maybe some medical units or logistic
                    support, because obviously they were beneficiaries of the oil coming out of the
                    gulf - In fact they counted on it - so they tested the waters with the Diet and
                    were defeated. Basically, the Diet refused having any substantial participation
                    by the Japanese in this effort. This is right as we were approaching a climactic
                    period in our negotiations on burdensharing, and the Japanese were very ashamed
                    about this, and I remember an evening - they were always very courteous, and we
                    would go out to a Japanese inn and have a wonderful dinner, and their fluent
                    English-speaking Foreign Ministry people would come along - and I had an
                    extensive conversation - these dinners went on for quite a while - and I had a
                    very intense conversation with a mid-level Japanese Foreign Ministry official
                    who confided in me his nightmare. I said, “What is your nightmare?” and he said,
                    “My nightmare is the vision after you all go in against a very well-dug-in Iraqi
                    force in Kuwait, and I see thousands of US body bags being flown back to the
                    United States, and we're not involved in even the most remote support capacity
                    because of the attitude of our Diet.” He said, “This is my nightmare, and this
                    will cause great shame among the Japanese people.” So I have to say that I was a
                    little bit wicked, I think. I played on this element of shame in my
                    negotiations, because we had already achieved quite a bit in terms of their
                    picking up labor costs for running our bases and so forth. I wanted also to work
                    into that the sizeable Japanese labor force in our post exchanges, and they
                    balked at that. They said, “Well, we understand that the people who work in the
                    post exchanges are not paid for out of a line-item in your budget.” I mean, they
                    used phrases like that. They knew how we operated.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0204" n="Page0204"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I was shooting big, you know. I'd already gotten a lot out of them,
                    including a huge buck-up in support costs. I wanted them to pay for all of our
                    utilities, all of our housing, on-base and off-base, and they finally agreed to
                    that, and then I wanted them to pay all the labor costs, too, including in the
                    post exchanges. They wouldn't do that. “That's not a line item in your budget;
                    you pay for that out of your exchange profits.” I said, “Well, largely we do.
                    That's perfectly true, although there is some appropriated funding that goes
                    into that as well. But yes, largely out of profits.” He said, “What would you do
                    with this?” They kept using the phrase windfall. “If we pay for that, it would
                    be a windfall for you?” I said, “Well, we would lower the costs for our
                    families.” Then at a critical point in our discussion I said, “I can't believe
                    that the Japanese Government would object to lowering the costs for the families
                    of our service people who are fighting on our behalf - both of us - in Iraq to
                    preserve our energy resources.” Well, you know, that element of shame - it
                    worked. They agreed to that finally, although not at that moment. They said that
                    they would have to think about that. This was sort of the penultimate thing. I
                    went back to Washington after this, and I said that I would await their
                    communication as to when I should return to complete this negotiation. I had a
                    phone call about a week later from a senior official in the Foreign Ministry I'd
                    been working with on this, and he said, “We'd like you to come back next week
                    between such-and-such a date and such-and-such a date, and that's important for
                    us because we'd like you to come in the middle there because on either end of
                    your visit will be some important national security meetings, and we'd like you
                    to come right smack at that time, right in the middle of that process, because
                    the whole question of burdensharing will come up.” So I wondered about that. I
                    said, sure, I'd be happy to come. I began to have this feeling that they were
                    stage-managing this, because of their interagency problems. I couldn't quite
                    figure it out, but I agreed to go. So I went back and the usual thing. I made my
                    calls at the Foreign Ministry and in the Defense Agency, and it was a cold
                    shower, because it was closing the loop in the final part of a negotiation,
                    including the issue of paying for utilities and paying for the labor force. I
                    had a very bad meeting at the Defense Ministry, and then that night I had dinner
                    with the Foreign Ministry people, and I got nowhere. I mean it was really a
                    stiff-arm. I went to bed that night quite depressed, thinking that we weren't
                    going to get there, at least on this visit. We were scheduled to have a
                    breakfast meeting with the Defense Ministry people at about seven o'clock, and
                    it was a pretty big breakfast, sort of nine on a side. That morning, at about
                    six o'clock, I had a phone call from my counterpart, and he said, “I'd like to
                    meet with you alone, not nine on a side, but just the two of us.” So I said that
                    would be fine, because I could tell - something - that they had been doing some
                    soul-searching during the night. I quickly called the lieutenant general, head
                    of our US Forces in Japan, and he said, oh, absolutely, hey, I'm just going to
                    stay out of this, this sounds like they're warming to a deal, go at it. So I had
                    breakfast with this guy, and he said, “Look, we're going to meet all your
                    demands, but you can't say anything yet because I have to fix it with the
                    Finance Ministry and the Foreign Ministry, and it will take me probably a couple
                    of days, so for the rest of today, your time here, you're going to have to play
                    it as if we're still negotiating, and I hope you can go along with that - but we
                    will do this; you will get everything you have requested; this is a guarantee.”
                    So I said, “Okay.”</p>
                <pb facs="0205" n="Page0205"/>
                <p>Then the next event was later that morning we went to the Foreign Ministry, and
                    there was this huge hall, where on one side of the table there were about 50
                    Japanese. I'm not exaggerating. I mean, the Foreign Ministry, the Defense
                    Ministry, and their administrative agency that actually administered all of the
                    bases and our relationship. We had about eight people on our side. And right in
                    the middle, opposite me, was the Defense Ministry guy and the Foreign Ministry
                    guy. They'd produced a document. They said, “Well, here's the agreement we're
                    going to sign.” I said, “Hey, wait a minute. I've never seen this agreement.”
                    This is in both English and Japanese. He said, “Oh, no, don't worry, it's just a
                    draft.” I said, “Well, the first time I see it, I'm happy to go through it with
                    you, but on the understanding that this is ad referendum to my government. I
                    can't agree to anything until our own lawyers have looked at it.” He said, “No,
                    no, we understand. Don't worry, just please bear with us, walk through this
                    agreement with us.” So we went through the agreement. We started right away in
                    the first paragraph of the agreement, there a sentence and then behind it was a
                    second sentence in brackets. Now normally in a negotiation, one side or the
                    other will bracket something that they can't agree to, and you try alternate
                    formulations. I said, “I don't understand why this second version of this same
                    concept is in brackets. We've never negotiated on this.” He said, “Oh, that's
                    the Defense Ministry's bracket.” I suddenly realized what was going on here and
                    why they wanted me there during these meetings, these bookend meetings of the
                    national security council. They were using me to settle arguments. They didn't
                    want to have confrontations. So we went through that document. He said, “Well,
                    what do you think?” I said, “Well, I like the first formulation.” He looked at
                    the Defense Ministry guy and he says, “Done.” We went through the entire
                    agreement paragraph by paragraph, and all I had to say was what my preference
                    was. That settled their interagency arguments. I went back to Washington, and in
                    two days, I had a phone call from him and he said, “We have an agreement; we're
                    ready to sign it.” And then I produced it, I went through it, and there were
                    some very subsidiary ancillary agreements, and we took it, the Japanese foreign
                    minister came to Washington, and then we had a big ceremony in the treaty room,
                    and Jim Baker signed for the United States, and it was done - and - this is the
                    best part - we got out of that, in a stair-step agreement, over five years, $17
                    billion out of the Japanese. The second one that happened later when I was in
                    the Defense Department, different job - they kept going up - the second
                    five-year agreement was for $25 billion. So this was the high-water mark of my
                    time in the burdensharing job, the Japanese agreement. It was the best thing
                    that we did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the basis behind this was that essentially the
                        Japanese were not paying very much for their own defense-</hi>

                <p>HOLMES: That's right.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That the United States, with its Air Force, military, and

                <pb facs="0206" n="Page0206"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Mostly Air and Navy, minimal Army.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: -Air and Navy, were providing for the Japanese defense,
                        and the Japanese were not.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: That's right.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I mean this wasn't hat in hand. The Japanese were not
                        having to spend an exorbitant amount that every other country practically
                        does in building up its military forces.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: That's correct. I think their entire armed forces at that time were about
                    250,000. It was very small. But we did exercise together. I mean our aircraft
                    flew missions together. We had small naval exercises together. But you're
                    absolutely right. We were providing for their defense, and our facilities were
                    gorgeous. They built absolutely the best facilities I've ever seen anyplace for
                    our forces. I mean, hospital, post exchanges, the clubs, the housing at the
                    various bases - because we had F-15's, we had, of course, a huge setup in
                    Yokosuka, our naval base there, and several air bases, and we had extraordinary
                    facilities, much better than what the Japanese forces had, quite frankly.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As a continuation of this, did you have to negotiate or do
                        something to make sure that the PX did lower its prices? I can see a problem
                        there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, I didn't get involved in that, but that was obviously handled by US
                    Forces Japan. It all worked, and the proof of the pudding is that every year
                    they did exactly what they said they would do, and the Diet went along with it.
                    That stair-step agreement that cumulatively represented $17 billion, was
                    absolutely right on schedule, and then the following agreement, the fact that it
                    continued and they were able to increase it to $25 billion. So it worked. They
                    were true to their word. Once the Japanese signed up for something, they did
                    it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Moving over to Korea.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0207" n="Page0207"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Now, the Koreans were the most difficult negotiators I've ever
                    encountered. They were absolutely incredible, and the first thing I had to
                    endure when I went there with Cheney was a kisaeng party, which was sort of an
                    evening with the equivalent of Korean geishas. I remember going through the
                    receiving line at this party that the Korean defense minister gave. I was
                    negotiating with the assistant minister of defense, who later was defense
                    minister - and after that he got in trouble and got caught with his hand in the
                    cookie jar and was fired - Mr. Kwan was his name. But the defense minister asked
                    me as I went through the receiving line, “Are you here with your wife?” I said,
                    “No, I'm here alone.” He said, “Good, we must have a kisaeng party,” and he
                    summoned an ROK brigadier general, a Marine, and he told him to arrange a party.
                    So several of us were subjected to this evening where we went to a sort of a
                    little inn out on the outskirts of Seoul, and there were Korean general officers
                    that were with us, and my host was this assistant minister of defense. These
                    ladies, the Korean ladies in their actually very beautiful, primary-color gowns
                    that Korean women wear, and there was a hostess there for each one of us, and a
                    fifth of scotch at each place. They started serving things. There was this
                    horrible thick, white pasty substance which I instinctively knew that I should
                    consume a great deal of. It looked like something that would be used to hang
                    posters up with, and this was to line your stomach. I drank a lot of that,
                    because I could see we were in for a sort of a disagreeable drinking party. Then
                    I remember we had to sing. I sang the British Marine Corps hymn, a cappella, and
                    we danced. Fortunately, there was a curfew at midnight which spared us all a
                    party that would go into the wee hours.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I spent three years in Seoul, and the curfew was the
                        greatest godsend known to man.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0208" n="Page0208"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Anyway, there was a sort of a bonding process. It was required, and it
                    made a difference. I mean it actually helped in terms of breaking down the sort
                    of bureaucratic barriers and allowed me to develop a relationship with Kwan -
                    although it wasn't the drinking that brought us... because our first sessions
                    were a disaster. I mean it was just no, no, no, hell no was their attitude when
                    I put our requests on the table. But he was an interesting guy because I found
                    out he was a Christian and he and his church had a bible running underground
                    mission going on. They smuggled bibles to Christian cells in North Korea through
                    China. It was quite fascinating, and he told me all about this, and also his
                    loathing for the Japanese and how his family had suffered at their hands during
                    the 30-odd-year occupation. So we got to be pretty good friends. He told me a
                    lot of things about his background. The fact that he was telling me indicated to
                    me that we were getting close. But it was really a struggle, and I went to Seoul
                    a lot, and before going I would always figure out what I thought was the minimum
                    I could accept from the Koreans for that particular round, and then I would very
                    methodically go around and clear that, or establish it, with the Defense
                    Department, with the NSC, and with the State Department, so that they would know
                    that if I didn't get that that I would walk away from it - which I did. I walked
                    away from the agreement twice, and it makes a huge difference, in any
                    negotiation, being prepared to walk away from it. They were stunned the first
                    time I did it. Each time I did it - the two times - I would get a call in the
                    morning saying, “Would you like to have breakfast together?” and they would say
                    things to me like, “We like you, and we don't want you to get in trouble in
                    Washington when you haven't delivered what you've sought, and so we're going to
                    accede to your request, but it will take us a week or so.”</p>
                <p>Then they would do some back-pedaling, unlike the Japanese. Once you had an
                    agreement with the Japanese it was done. I remember on flying into Seoul, I
                    would sometimes be seated next to an American businessman, and they would tell
                    me stories about negotiating where they literally, as they were leaving,
                    boarding their aircraft, their Korean business counterpart was walking with them
                    practically onto the aircraft still negotiating something that had been agreed
                    two days earlier.</p>
                <p>So it was difficult, and I was not as successful in Korea as I was in Japan, but
                    I still got a program that got us about $300 million a year. I think our US
                    Forces in Korea were surprised that we got as much as we did. I got a lot of
                    help. I always started my visits there with the staff of the US Forces Korea,
                    and of course I would go up and see the CINC and tell him what I was doing. But
                    we made progress, we did make progress there - enough so that we were able to
                    increase the burdensharing portion. Again it was an escalating amount over a
                    period of years, and it was sufficient to satisfy Congress that we were making
                    progress there.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0209" n="Page0209"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, one of the things - a cultural note - in dealing
                        with the Koreans, their talking about not getting you into trouble - this is
                        one of the things that's always tricky with the Koreans because often at
                        middle management or something they're told to go out and do something, and
                        if they don't do it, they really are in trouble. I mean they don't look upon
                        this as just being a negotiation. They tell somebody to go do it. They're
                        supposed to come back with their shield or on it. So it makes it very
                        difficult to deal with these people, because they have a much more personal
                        stake in a negotiation than we do. We go and say, “I gave it my best shot.”
                        And it didn't work? Well, we shrug it off and say we'll try again. But it's
                        not on your back. But for them it gets personal.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, it does get personal, and you're absolutely right, and I had some
                    very knowledgeable people who were helping me, including very good people in our
                    embassy there who spoke fluent Korean and who understood the culture and
                    explained things like that to me. So I was always very careful to call on a
                    defense minister, not at the beginning, but towards the end of my visit there,
                    and to always praise his negotiators and to say how difficult it was negotiating
                    with them because they were so tough - you know - as a way of doing exactly what
                    you're talking about, to sort of make it easier for them if they didn't get
                    quite what they wanted, you know, what they were willing to deliver to us.
                    You're absolutely right.</p>
                <p>But during the several years I was negotiating there, there was a transformation
                    in their culture. One was they clamped down on entertainment. When I first got
                    there, I went to an extraordinary ice capades after dinner, where the skaters
                    were bare-breasted - I mean, it was the most amazing show - I'd never seen ice
                    capades like that, but it was obviously very expensive. But towards the end of
                    my period there, we were reduced to going to the Korean officers' club. I had
                    asked for Korean food, because they were always serving American and French
                    food. I said, “I'd like Korean food.” So the last time was a very low-budget
                    entertainment at the officers' club, and we had a Korean dinner, and that was
                    fine with me. But they also had been discouraged from playing so much golf. That
                    was an introduction of the new president of Korea who was trying to get all of
                    his generals and senior officials from spending all of their time on the golf
                    course.</p>

                    the Koreans, of course, fought with us in Vietnam. They had substantial forces
                    in Vietnam, and particularly their marines were tough. The Vietnamese avoided
                    combat with them after they'd trapped them on one particular occasion, where
                    they'd baited a trap for them, and they opened up a place and allowed them to
                    come in and then closed the ring around them and then destroyed this North
                    Vietnamese unit by Tae Kwan Do, during the night. The next morning, they were
                    all dead, the Vietnamese were, and they invited the press in. That unit didn't
                    have too many problems after that. They always went with bags of rice every
                    place. They gave rice to the Vietnamese villagers wherever they went. They were
                    quite skillful.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, the Philippines was of interest. I didn't have in my
                    responsibilities in burdensharing much to do with the Philippines, but I did go.
                    I would go on these trips with Cheney, and I remember on one occasion we did
                    visit the Philippines, and that was fun for me because I got to stay with
                    probably my oldest friend, Nick Platt, who was our ambassador in the Philippines
                    at the time, and we had some very interesting discussions. I mean they had
                    interesting discussions. It was really no burdensharing agenda, but they were,
                    of course, in the beginning part of negotiating for Clark Field and Subic Bay,
                    which later, of course, particularly after Mt. Pinatubo exploded and covered
                    Clark Field in ash, became, in fact, the sort of coup de grace for our presence
                    there, although it probably was a good... It had to happen at some time. After
                    all, the United States had two colonies, basically. We had the Philippines and
                    we had Panama. At some juncture that was bound to end. It had to. It was
                    happening all over the world. We were not a colonial power, but in fact, we had
                    two colonies. It was an exceedingly difficult negotiation with the Filipinos,
                    and now, apparently, I'm told, from people who have been there recently, they
                    have turned Subic Bay, that wonderful complex which it broke our Navy's heart to
                    lose that, but they have turned it into an industrial park that is working. It's
                    actually helping the Philippine economy.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I don't know whether we covered this in an earlier session or not, but
                    yes, it was out of bounds because basically - I had sort of suggested it to
                    Shultz when the New Zealanders refused to continue to abide by the
                    neither-confirm-nor-deny policy with respect to the presence or not of nuclear
                    weapons on our warships - we drummed them out of ANZUS, and it became an
                    Australian-US relationship. It was very tough for the Australians to do that,
                    but they agreed. I remember the first meeting we had in San Francisco, chaired
                    by Shultz and his counterpart, where the New Zealanders were not present. It was
                    tough.</p>

                <pb facs="0212" n="Page0212"/>
                <p>HOLMES: No. Of course the big catch, of course, was the - how much was it? - $50
                    billion we got from the Japanese and other allies for the conduct of the Kuwait
                    campaign. I was consulted a little bit, and I worked on the margins on that, but
                    basically that burdensharing effort was done by the Secretary of State, the
                    Secretary of Defense, and the Secretary of the Treasury. Bush sent his Cabinet
                    out to beat the bushes for the money. Basically it was done at that level. It
                    was extraordinary, and it will never happen again. The Japanese, who of course-
                    (end of tape)</p>
                <p>The Saudis, who paid a huge amount to cover the costs of that war, had a serious
                    cash-flow problem, and they actually had to go into the international financial
                    marketplace and take out two Japanese-led syndicated loans to meet their
                    payments to us. I mean it was tough, even for them. They weren't used to
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, on this burdensharing business, what was the
                        role of Baker?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No role. Baker played absolutely no role. I dealt exclusively at that
                    level - at the Cabinet level - with the Secretary of Defense. It just worked out
                    that way. Now basically, Larry Eagleburger, who was Baker's deputy, told me, he
                    said, “Come and let me know what's going on from time to time.” So I would go
                    and see Larry every five months or so and just sit down with him and brief him
                    on where we were, and that was it. I mean, that was my reporting chain. The only
                    role that Baker played was when he signed, in the Treaty Room on the Seventh
                    Floor of the State Department, the agreement with the Japanese. I briefed him
                    for about five minutes before it, and he said fine.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It sounds like a perfect relationship. No point in having
                        a Secretary of State mucking around.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, you know... Of course, I worked very closely with the Bureau of
                    Asian and Pacific Affairs in the State Department, at the sort of level of
                    assistant secretary, deputy assistant secretary, office director. I worked with
                    anybody who could give me the information that I needed, who could make it
                    happen for me. It didn't matter whether it was the Desk officer or the Secretary
                    of Defense.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because you were a creature of Congress, did you keep

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, I did. I would occasionally go up and brief members on the Hill -
                    but perfunctorily and not frequently, about once a year.</p>

                <pb facs="0213" n="Page0213"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Sure.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why don't we talk about NATO then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: That's the shortest piece, anyway, because I had the least success with
                    NATO. Basically, what I tried to do with NATO was to get some of the NATO
                    international funds. I tried to get a larger participation, particularly with
                    the Germans. I spent a lot of time visiting in Bonn talking with the Defense
                    Ministry, and there I had to deal with the Finance Ministry, and they were just
                    rock hard. I couldn't get through to them.</p>
                <p>I got practically nothing out of the Germans, but I had an idea that I think
                    would have helped us a lot if the Administration and the Congress had allowed
                    it, which they didn't. About that time we were going through residual value
                    negotiations with the Germans. We were closing bases and consolidating bases
                    throughout the Federal Republic, and under the arrangements that we had with the
                    German Government, we were required when we gave up bases to settle the residual
                    value. Now we felt that the Germans would owe us money, because we had put a
                    certain amount of investment into German bases that we had occupied since the
                    war. The Germans were very clever in keeping these payments to a minimum,
                    because they would say, “Well, that's right, you put a certain amount in, but
                    there also has been a deleterious effect on the environment. In your motor pool
                    parks and other places, there has been contamination of the soil. There have
                    been impact areas where you have fired weapons and dropped bombs, ruined
                    agricultural areas.” So the Germans, of course, were pumping up the
                    environmental costs as we were trying to get as much of the residual value back
                    in the final base settlement as we could.</p>
                <pb facs="0214" n="Page0214"/>
                <p>So I had some discussions with both the US Army in Germany and with some German
                    officers who suggested to me with a wink and a nod, that if in our consolidated
                    base structure we would ensure that the contracts for base maintenance would be
                    available in increasing numbers to German contractors and if the money that they
                    would eventually pay us in residual value payments would stay in Germany, then
                    they wouldn't fight so hard on the environmental costs. They sent me a very
                    clear message. A couple of US brigadier generals and a colonel that I was
                    working with on the Army side thought that this was genuine, and they had
                    already done some preparatory work on this. So I thought this was a terrific
                    idea - rather than forcing the Germans to make out a check (which wouldn't go to
                    the Defense Department anyway; it would go back to the Treasury), if the
                    residual value payments could be recycled into our total costs for our remaining
                    bases in Germany and if, under an open bidding process, the German contractors
                    could get a better deal and the result would be that we would be well taken care
                    of and the bases would run and the money would stay in Germany, I thought it was
                    absolutely the right way to go. I saw this as a sort of an adjunct to a
                    burdensharing agreement. So I worked very hard. We developed a plan, we made a
                    proposal, we sent it to Washington. People liked it, but the Congress didn't
                    like it. They wanted the German Treasury to send money to the United States. We
                    argued about it. There were people that went to the Hill and tried to defend it,
                    and we got a little bit of it going. Here and there, there were a few contracts
                    that were wrapped that helped, but we missed a big opportunity there. We could
                    have had a very substantial system and payments from the Germans if we had been
                    able to apply it in large scale across all of our facilities in Germany. It
                    didn't work. So on the burdensharing front I didn't make much progress in
                    Germany.</p>
                <p>The last thing I worked on, just as I was leaving office was an arrangement... I
                    was working with CENTCOM. I went down to Tampa a couple of times on something
                    where I thought we could do a burdensharing arrangement in the Gulf where we
                    would get those allies, European and Japanese, who benefitted the most from our
                    continuing presence in the Gulf, to pay some of the burdensharing costs for our
                    forces in the Gulf. I worked with CENTCOM, and we had a pretty good concept and
                    the beginnings of a plan, and about that time, my time was up.</p>

                    was to negotiate with the Soviets to allow the unification of Germany with
                    Germany continuing to be a full participating member of NATO provided that we
                    didn't station US forces in what had been Eastern Germany. It was different for
                    the German Army, of course, but that negotiation, which is... I mean, talk about
                    unsung heroes - some day... Well, it's beginning to happen now - people are
                    beginning to recognize that this was really an extraordinary negotiation that
                    was carried out by Baker, very successful. It brought out, he used his best
                    talents as a negotiator.</p>

                        when you left being the “burdensharer.” You laid your burdensharing down, I

                <p>***</p>
                <p>Today is June 22, 1999. Allen, in '93, you're off to the Department of Defense.
                    You were there from '93 to when?</p>
                <p>HOLMES: I was there from November of '93 to the end of January, '99, when I left
                    and started my retirement proceedings in the Department of State.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what your job was and where did it fit
                        within the Department of Defense?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I took on a job that had been created in 1986 at the time that the
                    special operations community of the armed forces were gathered together in one
                    command known as the Special Operations Command and given various special
                    responsibilities and resources including the ability to budget for research,
                    development, testing, evaluation, and procurement of special-operations-peculiar
                    equipment. They felt at the time that they needed somebody at the assistant
                    secretary level to act as a kind of service secretariat for what was a unique
                    command and to oversee the policy and resources of that special operations
                    command. So that was the job I was recruited into. It was my charter
                    responsibility, but I had other responsibilities as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We'll talk about the other responsibilities as this goes,
                        but could you define - I mean we're talking about people who are going to be
                        reading this in a different era and all - what do we mean by “special
                        operations” at that particular time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0217" n="Page0217"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, it was a unique job that in terms of special operations sort of
                    went against the grain of the traditional organization and mission of the armed
                    forces. Basically, special operations included all of the commando-type elements
                    of the armed forces - the Navy Seals, that used to be known as Underwater
                    Demolition Teams at the time of the Korean War, and later became the Seals; the
                    Air Force, where all of the air commandos, the C-130 aircraft that were used for
                    infiltration and exfiltration of commandos and rangers; the AC-130 gunships that
                    were used for close air support; the intelligence gathering aircraft; the PAVE
                    LOW helicopters, arguably the most complex helicopter in existence - all of that
                    grouping. Then the Army - the majority of the special operations force was Army
                    - included all of the special forces, the Green Berets, the Ranger Regiment, the
                    Special Operations Aviation Regiment at Fort Campbell, the Civil affairs people,
                    and the Psychological Operations Command. All of them were included in the
                    Special Operations Command of the Army, which was part of the Special Operations
                    Joint Command. There was another unit which is difficult to talk about in an
                    unclassified history, but let it suffice to say that it was made up of “special
                    mission units” of both Army and Navy and components that were available for the
                    full range of difficult counter-terrorism types of missions and combat missions
                    as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: We hear the term “Delta Force” used.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, that is the popular term, and that, in fact, was the Army component
                    of that command.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you know, those of us that have been around for a
                        while know about the military. There's always been this annoyance, from
                        World War II on, the commandos and all taking the cream off and going off on
                        these special missions and all, which sort of raises hob with regular units
                        and all. I would have thought that you would have found yourself in the very
                        difficult position with sort of the mainline forces looking upon you all as
                        the Cinderellas, getting special money, and all that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0218" n="Page0218"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, it was very difficult. Beginning back in 1986 approximately - that
                    was, of course, several years before I arrived on the scene - the formation of
                    the Special Operations Command met the combined resistance of all the services.
                    First of all, they didn't like the fact that their special operations people
                    were being removed from the regular services and put into a special command.
                    Traditionally when there were periods of cutbacks, that cycle that the Defense
                    Department like other departments of government goes through, they found it
                    convenient to use their special operations people to cut, when they had to take
                    cuts. The Army, for example, was very oriented towards the “heavy” Army, towards
                    armor and heavy artillery. After all, this command was born during the Cold War,
                    when our mission was to withstand the Soviet Army across the north German plain
                    or through the Fulda Gap, and so their major budget requests were directed
                    towards improving, basically, their heavy armament. So the idea of special units
                    - light infantry trained in special tactics - were a sort of nice-to-have add-on
                    to what their main concentration was on. Now what was remarkable about the
                    formation of this unit was the prescience of then-Senator Bill Cohen and Sam
                    Nunn and Representative Dan Daniels, who at the height of the Cold War, with the
                    emphasis on strategic systems and heavy armor and so forth, had the prescience
                    to look beyond the Cold War to a day when it would be important to have a
                    command like this with its own resources - and that really is the key. Something
                    called Major Force Program 11 (MFP-11) was a special budget for the Special
                    Operations Command. No other command has its own budget. The commander in chief
                    of the Special Operations Command had what they call head-of-agency authority,
                    which allowed him to work with a budget of over $3 billion. Most of that is a
                    classic Defense Department budget. The majority, over 50 percent, went to pay
                    allowances and training. But they did have their own development budget
                    basically to perform research, development, testing, and evaluation of
                    special-operations-peculiar equipment. What they did was to take the normal
                    equipment that was available in the armed services and outfit the special
                    operators with those and then adapt some of that equipment to the needs of their
                    mission and also develop and procure additional equipment. This is unique, and
                    it did incite a certain jealousy among the traditional commands. Now you have to
                    understand that the command basically is a training command. They take the cream
                    - the selection process is rigorous in these training programs - the cream of
                    the Army, Navy, and air and helicopter pilots and develop them, train them,
                    select them, and then feed them back to the regional war-fighting commands, the
                    five regional commands, some of them assigned on a regular basis and others
                    available for assignment based on the mission that might be given a
                    particular-</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So they're not just a sitting group. They train, put them
                        back, and then they can call in when they need it.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0219" n="Page0219"/>
                <p>HOLMES: That's right. An example would be in the early period of the Bosnia
                    effort, the intervention force and the stabilization force - IFOR and SFOR.
                    During that period at least half of the 352nd Special Operations Group of the
                    Air Force Special Operations Command, which is stationed in England, in
                    Mendenhall, was forward-deployed in Brindisi, in Italy. They had C-130s there
                    for rescue operations. The had some Pave Low 53 J helicopters. They had some
                    AC-130 gunships to provide support. They had a platoon of Navy Seals there as
                    well, and their mission was to rescue downed flyers, basically. That was their
                    major mission. They would rotate them out of England and then when they needed
                    reinforcements - because the AC-130 gunships, for example, are never assigned
                    forward on a permanent basis; they're always kept back at Hurlburt Field, which
                    is the headquarters of the Air Force Special Operations Command, and then as
                    needed, they're deployed forward and assigned to the regional CINC and as part
                    of, in that case, the European Special Operations Command. There is a small
                    unit. The European and the Pacific ones were the two most robust, probably 1,800
                    to 2,000 people permanently deployed as part of that command and then reinforced
                    as necessary from assets drawn from the United States. If they needed for an
                    operation, let's say, an airfield take-down operation, and they needed a
                    battalion of Rangers, then the Ranger Regiment part of the Army Special
                    Operations Command would forward-deploy a battalion, integrated into that force
                    under the command of the regional CINC, and then that mission would be carried
                    out in that way. But it caused a lot of jealousy. It was fiercely resisted by
                    the services when this command was first set up.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The command was first set up when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: It was 1986, and by the end of 1987 they were really fully in business.
                    But they were fiercely resisted, and the Navy, for example, never completely
                    agreed to give up all of its seals, so that the naval special warfare command in
                    Coronado, which was the Navy part of Special Operations, had to rotate their
                    Seals in and out of the fleet as well, because the fleet commanders liked to
                    have detachments of Seals on board for their mission. So there was always a
                    certain amount of jealousy there, although that situation has been improved
                    tremendously over the years, as the command grew in respect and was finally
                    recognized. I would say that by 1994 or 95, the command was fully recognized and
                    greatly appreciated because of their capabilities and the kind of missions that
                    the armed forces in the '90s were being asked to perform. They really came into
                    their own at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0220" n="Page0220"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, was this command the ultimate result of the failed
                        mission to rescue the hostages in Iran?HOLMES: Yes. You're absolutely right.
                        What they called Desert One, which was the place where the rescue mission
                        was aborted in the spring of 1980 - if memory serves me correctly. The
                        takeover of the embassy in Teheran was November 4, approximately, 1979. By
                        the following spring, the administration had put together a rescue force
                        which was made up of Air and Army commandos, and they had never trained
                        together, their equipment was inappropriate for the mission, it was skimpy,
                        it was hastily convened. I mean, it was a classic example of bad
                        preparation, bad equipment, and bad planning. It ended in failure - despite
                        the gallantry of individual members - in the desert when a couple of
                        helicopters were down. When they aborted the mission, in the sandstorm and
                        the darkness taking off, they crashed into each other and had quite a few
                        losses. Well, that led to various investigative commissions. One of them, I
                        believe, was carried out by Admiral Holloway, and then after a number of
                        soul-searching examinations of this failure, a conclusion was that the armed
                        services needed to have a regular special operations unit of some sort to be
                        able to carry out this kind of mission. The goal was always to have
                        equipment - helicopters and/or aircraft - that could depart and carry out a
                        mission under the cover of one period of darkness, because that was one of
                        the problems in Desert One, the question of refueling - the aircraft that
                        they had did not have long legs and allow them to get all the way to Teheran
                        and... I mean, basically they had a very thorough plan and some very good
                        people recruited who were already on the ground in Teheran. I mean they had
                        special operators that were already there, Farsi-speaking, that had made
                        contact with people and who were doing the arrangements at the other end.
                        When things went sour, they just quietly disappeared, got out of Iran. But
                        that was really the crucible within which the Special Operations Command of
                        today was born, and it is a remarkable growth in capability because today
                        there's no question but that they're the finest special operations
                        capability anywhere in the world - highly motivated, extremely well trained,
                        well equipped, well led, and now, as I say, fully respected and integrated
                        into the war-fighting commands. In fact, for example in Europe, the real
                        discovery was General Joulwan, when he was the commander in chief of the
                        European Command. He had not known much about his special operations command
                        until they had to mount the Bosnia mission, and all of a sudden he had this
                        superb capability available, and he suddenly began to notice that for
                        example the finest helicopter pilots in the world... They did all their
                        training at night, and they could perform small miracles in mobility and the
                        ability to get in in a quiet way and do things. Then when Secretary Brown's
                        aircraft went down-</hi>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They crashed - Secretary of Commerce Brown was killed in

                </p>
                <pb facs="0221" n="Page0221"/>
                <p>HOLMES: It wasn't Dubrovnik but it was near. It was in Croatia. I can't remember
                    the name of the town, but it was a remote area, and it crashed, and it was
                    basically the Special Operations Command of Europe that went in, found the body,
                    got him out. They barely had time to do their laundry after that when they were
                    called upon to perform really an extraordinary rescue mission of our embassy in
                    Monrovia. So by the time of those sort of three very difficult missions in rapid
                    succession, the commander-in-chief of the European Command was absolutely sold
                    on them, as was his successor, Wes Clark. They did some remarkable work, and
                    remarkable work in Bosnia as well.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0222" n="Page0222"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, I didn't explain that. Let me think where we fit. As you know, the
                    Defense Department is basically divided into several components. There are the
                    services, the three services and the Marine Corps as part of the naval service;
                    and then there are the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the Joint Staff that supports
                    them, and they are completely integrated and joint. There are the defense
                    agencies, and they are many - they are legion - agencies that carry out special
                    research and intelligence - DIA, the Defense Intelligence Agency, for example.
                    Then there is the office of the Secretary of Defense, a very large office. The
                    senior civilian staff of the Department of Defense, led by the Secretary of
                    Defense, the deputy secretary, and then the four under secretaries - we used to
                    joke about it and say the four under secretaries were responsible for things,
                    people, money, and words. The things, of course, were the enormous research and
                    acquisition budget. The people were personnel. Money was the comptroller. The
                    undersecretary for policy was in charge of words. This is sort of a military
                    joke. But our office was in that part of the Department of Defense. When I first
                    arrived, Secretary Aspen had been doing some experimentation with the civilian
                    side of the Defense Department and had created... He had taken what had been
                    three assistant secretaryships and had expanded them into six policy areas.
                    Well, that had a sort of an unhappy wobbly history, and eventually, by I would
                    say two and one-half years later, we were back down to three. My job, the SOLIC,
                    the special operations and low-intensity conflict assistant secretaryship,
                    stayed throughout that and, in fact, acquired additional responsibilities, so
                    that during my last two years in the job I basically had five deputy assistant
                    secretaries. It was a lot of work. One, Policy and Missions, which contained in,
                    I would say, the sort of flagship responsibility of that office, which was
                    combating terrorism - both the offense and the defense, counter-terrorism and
                    antiterrorism force protection - which of course acquired huge new
                    responsibilities after the twin bombings in Saudi Arabia culminating in the
                    disastrous one at the Khobar Towers. There was also something called Forces and
                    Resources, which was basically a budget-support analysis staff that worked
                    within the Department of Defense and helped the budget people in Tampa, Florida,
                    at MacDill Air Force Base, where the Special Operations Command had its
                    headquarters, work on their program operations memorandum, their budget, every
                    year, guiding it through the thickets of the Defense Department and working with
                    the committees. They provided remarkable continuity because they were civil
                    servants several of whom had been there from the beginning of the creation of
                    this office, and they were invaluable to the people at the headquarters in
                    helping them get through the whole budget cycle and maintain the integrity of
                    the budget and avoid raids and provide explanations and the techniques of
                    putting together a good budget presentation. So that was another one. About a
                    year into the Aspen administration, about the time that Aspen left the Defense
                    Department, the very large counter-drug office, which had been in another part
                    of the Defense Department, came to us as a deputy assistant secretaryship, with
                    a very large budget. When it first arrived it was over a billion dollars, and we
                    did cut that way back in the process of analysis and off-sites and analysis and
                    help from the Congress that was quite willing to cut it back, so that was a very
                    large, I would say, horizontally integrated office that had its own tiny budget
                    shop and that also had... They had two missions basically - supply reduction and
                    to work with the President's counter-drug program and all the agencies of the
                    government that were involved in this, and that was training American law
                    enforcement and training law enforcement and military forces particularly along
                    the Andean Ridge but also in Thailand to go to the source of the drugs that were
                    coming into the United States and to try to disrupt that activity, and working
                    obviously with the State Department and the DEA and others. Most of the money in
                    that program went to supply reduction.</p>
                <pb facs="0223" n="Page0223"/>
                <p>But also we had a very vigorous demand reduction program within the Department of
                    Defense, and we supervised that program, because you'll recall that at the end
                    of the Vietnam War the armed services had a major drug problem. It was a
                    disaster. And thanks to some very dedicated officers who stayed on after Vietnam
                    and were determined to rebuild the Army, people like Barry McCaffrey, who ended
                    up as a four-star commander in chief of the Southern Command and then resigned
                    his commission and became the drug coordinator for the President in a cabinet
                    position. He was one of those who fought that fight, and the result was a very
                    happy one, because today in the armed forces drug use is about one and a half
                    percent, and it's based on a zero tolerance policy. In other words, if you get
                    caught, you're out. There are no second chances, unless some chemical imbalance
                    produces a false positive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: They can check and recheck.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0224" n="Page0224"/>
                <p>HOLMES: But this is a very vigorous program carried out by the services and
                    supervised and funded out of the counter-drug office within SOLIC. So that was a
                    very big program. Then we also had peacekeeping and humanitarian affairs, and I
                    had done some rearranging of the boxes in this organization because, one, we had
                    multiple reorganizations during the five years that I was there in the office of
                    Secretary of Defense. It was constantly being reviewed and reshaped, and one
                    responsibility I hung onto from the beginning was the humanitarian de-mining
                    policy and operations. I did that because our office basically created that. I
                    take a certain amount of satisfaction in having pushed that myself because I saw
                    the need, and it was a perfect mission for special operations forces, bringing
                    their remarkable skills, their language skills, their ability to work with
                    people in small units, in twos and threes and fours, and to make a difference
                    that was vastly disproportionate to their small numbers. The Green Berets, the
                    Special Forces, the Psychological Operations people, and the Civil Affairs
                    people were the ones who did that program, and I was right. It was a wonderful
                    mission for them. It was also very good for the United States and for the CINCs
                    around the world because typically what happened, taking Cambodia as an example
                    because it was an early example, the Cambodians asked for some help because they
                    were losing people in villages every day. Dozens of people were either being
                    killed or losing limbs as a result of the enormous infestation of land mines in
                    their country. So the first group that went in there was a psychological
                    operations major and two non-commissioned officers, and they stayed for several
                    months, and they put together a mine awareness program. First of all, they
                    surveyed the situation. They put together a mine awareness program, designed a
                    sort of a psychological plan, publicity basically, and they even hired a couple
                    of Cambodians to do a comic book in the Khmer language with drawings of children
                    wandering in a field and finding a land mine and then being told to put a ring
                    of stones around it and then walking off to inform a village elder or teacher or
                    a soldier of what had been found. On the inside of this little comic book, there
                    was photograph of the 10 or 12 different kinds of land mines that were
                    infesting, basically, Cambodian soil. That was the first thing. The Cambodian
                    Government wrote an incredible message of gratitude and praise for this
                    operation and begged the American to come back and train them. So phase two then
                    became a train-the-trainers operation. This was undertaken by the first
                    battalion of the First Special Forces Group, stationed in Okinawa. They even had
                    a couple of people who spoke Khmer and who were able to go in there. They
                    trained several platoons of Cambodian, quote, engineers. I mean, when they got
                    there, there was nothing. They didn't even have boots. They had no military
                    discipline or a sense of unit or mission, so basically, they took them and gave
                    them basic training, managed to get boots and khaki shorts and tee shirts for
                    them, and by the end of the year they had two platoons who were clearing roads
                    and fields of land mines. It was an incredible operation, and they didn't work
                    alone. They also coordinated what they were doing with the civilian Mine Action
                    Center in Phnom Penh, because there were a number of civilian de-miners and also
                    doctors who were working on the rehabilitation/prosthetics part of the problem.
                    It was an enormous problem. But anyway, it was a highly successful program, and
                    this spread, and I think at this point we have either been in or are in maybe as
                    many as 28 countries - Eritrea, Ethiopia, Central America, Namibia, Mozambique,
                    Laos (where there was more unexploded ordnance and mines, and they were able to
                    adapt to that and get a program going there as well). But it's been a remarkable
                    program that has helped a lot of people. It motivated the troops. They loved
                    helping people. It also allowed them to train and use their military skills. We
                    had a hell of a time with the Congress getting this thing off the ground in '93
                    and '94 because they couldn't understand why the Defense Department should do a
                    program like this. They said, “This sounds like an aid program. It should be
                    done by AID.” And yes, it could have been. There were civilian mine actions, but
                    the point was that with the remarkable capabilities and the discipline and the
                    ability to live in the field and to speak local tongues - not at Foreign Service
                    4/4 level, but at a sort of a 2/2 or 2+ level - these Special Forces and Civil
                    Affairs people were perfect for this mission.</p>

                    much, but they also were also the eyes and ears of the commander-in-chief of
                    that regional command, because these were mostly in countries where we did not
                    have established DOD-Ministry of Defense programs. Many of the countries were
                    former enemies or battlegrounds, and so-</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: So anyway, that was, I think, a real success story for the Special Forces
                    and Civil Affairs people, and they did a wonderful job and are continuing to do
                    this job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this mainly a request from the countries?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Finally the word got around, and we publicized it, obviously, through the
                    Department of State and through the attach�s. Typically an ambassador would send
                    in a message and ask for a survey team to come out very quickly, and then that
                    would lead, depending on what they found, in rapid succession to a mine
                    awareness program, and then a train-the-trainers program, and then they would
                    set up the programs and they would do what they called “sustainment training.”
                    Once it was up and running, they would send back a warrant officer or a couple
                    of people from that particular regional Special Forces Group to check on the
                    program, that is, to kind of give some advice on how it might be improved or to
                    spot any problems with the program. So this was terrific, and that was part of
                    the... I shifted that operation into the Peacekeeping and Humanitarian
                    Assistance part of the SOLIC, and today, they have been incredible busy. Just to
                    give you an example of what they have been doing today for Kosovo - before the
                    bombing campaign was over all the countries were building refugee camps, in
                    Macedonia and in Albania, we built, basically, and our people in SOLIC- (end of
                    tape)</p>
                <p>So they supervised the construction of the camp at Fort Dix that received the
                    Kosovar refugees that came to the United States and then three camps in the
                    zone. These were 20,000-people camps, and basically, by the time the bombing war
                    was over, they had two in operation and a third on the drawing board. So they
                    were very busy, and that was right on top of the Hurricane Mitch operation,
                    where they also were extremely-</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: That was in Central America. It basically hit all the countries. It think
                    Honduras was probably the worst, but they were all hit, and it was a huge
                    operation, carried out by Southern Command and supported by, again, this Office
                    of Peacekeeping and Humanitarian Assistance. All the peacekeeping operations
                    around the world, mostly observer missions but many of the UN missions have US
                    members, and we participated in the design and funding of these missions and
                    worked with the Department of Peacekeeping at the UN.</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, the one in the Sinai has been there ever since the Camp David
                    Accords, and I have my own view on that. I tried to begin to phase out the US
                    battalion because I thought - even though relations continued to be tense,
                    particularly during the Netanyahu Government, relations between Israel and Egypt
                    were tense - the Sinai is policed. There is an international mission there
                    headed by a Scandinavian general officer, but we have always rotated a battalion
                    of paratroops, which seems like an enormous commitment-</p>

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, but it was part of the accord. I took some stabs at it with the
                    State Department, and my blade was broken very quickly. They simply didn't want
                    to even talk about it. Now I think this will happen because, clearly, with the
                    downsizing and reduction of the size of the armed forces and particularly highly
                    trained troops like airborne, it is a waste in today's world. I mean it's a very
                    low priority. It's something that now has endured all these years and works. I
                    realized I was in trouble, that it would be very difficult if not impossible to
                    make headway on that, when we went into a tremendous flail after the destruction
                    of the Khobar Towers billet.</p>

                <pb facs="0227" n="Page0227"/>
                <p>HOLMES: A terrorist explosion that took place in June of 1996 in Saudi Arabia,
                    near Dhahran, where there was an Air Force composite wing that flew the missions
                    out of Saudi Arabia to enforce the no-fly zone in southern Iraq. That was their
                    mission. It was largely an American mission, but there were also some British
                    and French aircraft that participated, that flew the missions out of there. Some
                    of the pilots were billeted in this apartment building, a place called Khobar
                    Towers, outside of Dhahran, and they were hit with an enormous truck with
                    explosives equivalent to somewhere between 15,000 and 20,000 pounds. The losses
                    were high, and after that - which was the second attack against our forces in
                    Saudi Arabia, the first having been in, I believe it was, seven months earlier,
                    November, '95, in Riyadh, and that was an attack against our mission to train
                    the Saudi national guard - so after these two attacks, the Defense Department
                    went to general quarters - I can only describe it that way - and for three
                    months, Secretary Perry and General Shalikashvili really turned the place upside
                    down, and we went through a major revision of our whole antiterrorism force
                    protection program. We were in the middle of it in SOLIC because that had been
                    one of our charter responsibilities. In fact, our office already, at the time
                    that the Oklahoma City disaster occurred, had the only sort of comprehensive
                    handbook, which we had put together, on all the different aspects of physical
                    counter-terrorism and training and setback distances from roads. When the chief
                    of staff of the White House gathered the whole government together to do
                    something about he safety of the federal buildings in Washington and elsewhere,
                    this little document we had became a bestseller - and was a good platform from
                    which to embark on a major revision of the force protection policies of the
                    Defense Department, from training, physical protection, and development budgets
                    and so forth. This was a huge program that ensued, and a successful one - so
                    successful, in fact, that with the hardening of military facilities around the
                    world, the terrorists were on the prowl and looking for vulnerable embassies,
                    and when they attacked our two embassies in East Africa - which were not in
                    high-threat areas - it caused us all to rethink the whole process of protection
                    for US installations abroad and to not place so much emphasis on being in a
                    high-threat, medium-threat, or low-threat area but instead to look at the
                    vulnerabilities of our installations. Because certainly in neither Dar Es Salaam
                    nor Nairobi could you describe it as a high-threat area with a well-known high
                    profile terrorist group. There was criminality, yes - that had been there for a
                    long time - but anyway... This occupied a lot of our time.</p>

                <pb facs="0228" n="Page0228"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Excuse me, I didn't finish. I was describing the organization of SOLIC. I
                    talked about the counter-drug section and the peacekeeping and humanitarian
                    assistance one, and then finally, the fifth unit was basically the Office of
                    Latin American Affairs. It was the first time that SOLIC had received a
                    regional, as opposed to a functional, office under its responsibility, and this
                    was part of this reorganization, and the thinking was that given the very large
                    stake that the Defense Department had in counter-terrorism and particularly
                    counter-drugs in Latin America, that if you were going to redistribute the
                    portfolios, it made sense to put Latin America in SOLIC. That became part of our
                    responsibility as well, and we did a lot of work with the Argentines and the
                    Chileans and the Brazilians and the Mexicans out of that operation.</p>

                <p>HOLMES: Yes, International Security Affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: An awful lot of what you all were pointed towards doing
                        was doing something in case something happened in some foreign country. How
                        did you relate to this ISA?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0229" n="Page0229"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, very well. Actually, we had excellent relationships within the policy
                    area and worked very closely. For example, I worked a lot with the deputy
                    assistant secretary for Near Eastern Affairs in ISA because our office did some
                    very special liaison work with the Israelis on counter-terrorism. This was born
                    out of the President's visit to Sharm el-Sheikh, after the succession of human
                    bombings that had taken place in Israel and Rabin, you recall, was assassinated
                    and the government was getting quite panicked about how to stop this and asked
                    for help. So there was first a conference in Sharm el-Sheikh in Egypt, where it
                    was quite remarkable to see the Israeli delegation going around shaking hands
                    with Gulf Arabs. It was basically what to do about the common problem of
                    Terrorism. I was the DOD representative on that trip. We then went to Israel,
                    and I stayed behind for a couple of days to put together a program of
                    cooperation with the Israeli Government, particularly with the IDF with their
                    Ministry of Defense, people I had worked with before as assistant secretary for
                    political-military affairs in the State Department, so it was kind of a little
                    bit of a homecoming. We put together a special program in two fiscal years for a
                    total of $100 million to help them install anti-terrorism equipment, detectors,
                    sensors along their border posts and then also training. We learned from that,
                    too. We had an exchange of visits where, as we began to worry about our own
                    homeland defense against terrorism in the United States (because, of course, for
                    years we seemed to be immune from it - you know, it will never happen in
                    America), with the bombing of the Twin Towers, the World Trade Center in New
                    York, America lost its innocence... It was suddenly, My God, we have terrorism
                    in the United States. We began increasingly, inter-agency - not just the Defense
                    Department, working across the board particularly with the Justice Department,
                    FEMA, and the Public Health Service, and began to look at our own problems
                    within the United States. The Israelis had done a remarkable thing in setting up
                    their own home defense command after experiencing the missile bombings that took
                    place against Israel during the Gulf War, all the Scuds that rained down on
                    Haifa and Tel Aviv and Jerusalem. When that was over, the Israelis decided that
                    they would carve out of their armed forces a special home defense command. We
                    visited them and learned a lot from the kinds of things they were doing to
                    protect their population and to train them, and we had a number of exchanges
                    that were extremely interesting. Basically, it was a two-way street, because we
                    provided some funding and some equipment for them, but we got a lot of ideas
                    from them as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, can you talk about - you had three secretaries
                        of defense while you were there - Les Aspen, William Perry, and then William
                        Cohen.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: That's correct, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did they, each one, from your perspective, how did you
                        deal with them?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0230" n="Page0230"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, I had access to all of them, because under the statute that created
                    my job, I was supposed to have access and direct access if I needed to have it.
                    Only on one occasion did I have to go directly to Secretary Perry about a
                    problem that we had on the Hill where I was testifying, but usually I worked
                    very closely with Walt Slocombe - first Frank Wisner. Frank wasn't there very
                    long. Frank was there about as long as Les Aspen was, which was basically the
                    first year, and then he went off to be ambassador in India and was replaced by
                    his deputy, Walt Slocombe. So I worked very closely with Walt in that whole
                    period.</p>
                <p>A lot depended on the style of the individual secretary. Aspen was very
                    approachable, and he liked to have contact with his assistant secretaries as
                    well has his under secretaries because he was an ideas guy, and he loved to sit
                    around late at night and churn up ideas and new ways of attacking problems. But
                    as I say, my overlap with him was only a few months because I didn't get to the
                    Defense Department until November, and he was close to the end of his year.
                    Actually, he was in office just slightly less than a year.</p>
                <p>Bill Perry, whom I'd known in the Carter Administration, was very approachable,
                    and liked to have a lot of contact with the people - not only assistant
                    secretaries, but also the Desk officers, the people that were really
                    knowledgeable about the problems that he would inevitably have to deal with. So
                    in preparing of program decisions or visits by foreign leaders, Bill Perry
                    inevitably had the Desk officer present and the assistant secretary and brought
                    them into the conversation, would invite you to speak and participate. That was
                    his style, reminiscent of the way George Shultz operated in the State
                    Department.</p>
                <pb facs="0231" n="Page0231"/>
                <p>Bill Cohen had a different style. He came to the Defense Department with
                    basically two trusted senior special assistants that had been with him for many,
                    many years. One of them had been with him for almost 15 years. One was his sort
                    of chief of staff, more knowledgeable of the politics of the Hill and of the
                    administration, and the other was a substantive, brilliant guy. Then there was
                    an officer, the three-star Marine Corps lieutenant general who had worked on the
                    Hill and had been in Cohen's office during a tour of duty on the hill, and
                    they'd stayed in touch over the years. So he asked the Marine Corps to release
                    him. He was a little senior to be a military assistant. Normally the Secretary
                    of Defense's military assistant is a major general. But he asked the Marine
                    Corps to release this man, and by the way, I see now, I heard the other day, it
                    sounds like he's been rewarded. He's going to be the new commandant of the
                    Marine Corps, Jim Jones. But anyway, these three officers really were his tight
                    group around him that kind of basically ran the Defense Department. Now as time
                    went on and as Cohen got to know other individuals in the Pentagon, that circle
                    enlarged, but it was a different style. It was a slightly more remote way of
                    doing business. Fortunately, I had known him before, as a senator, and actually
                    even knowing that he was one of the fathers of the Special Operations Command, I
                    had briefed him a couple of times, just on my own initiative (and also looking
                    for some support on some of the new activities that we were engaged in), so I
                    had an easy relationship with him. He was fond of telling people he would look
                    at General Hugh Shelton, who was the new chairman but who had been the
                    commander-in-chief of the Special Operations Command and my partner for almost
                    two years, and he would look at this very tall six-foot-five officer and myself,
                    and he would say, “These are my children. I created them” - harking back to his
                    days with Sam Nunn in setting up the office and the command.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did you deal with... There must have been... The
                        guts of your organization was training, and this, of course, was not your
                        particular... I mean it shouldn't have been your specialty at all.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: No, it wasn't. The training, the mission of the command, was carried out
                    by the commander in chief. My job was to be the sort of supervisor from a policy
                    perspective and from a resources perspective. Now on the resources side, I
                    co-chaired something called the board of directors. The board of directors of
                    the Special Operations Command, the two co-chairmen were the... Well, I would
                    say, I have to put it this way - we were nominally called co-chairmen, but in
                    fact the commander in chief was the chairman, and I was the co-chairman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The commander in chief being?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0232" n="Page0232"/>
                <p>HOLMES: The four-star commander in chief of the Joint Special Operations Command,
                    which had these four components, Army, Navy, Air, and then the Special Missions
                    people. The other members of the board of directors were the subordinate
                    commanders, and together, after a lengthy process of producing what they call
                    the POM (Program Operations Memorandum), which is basically a six-year budget
                    projection with more attention to the first couple of years than in the out
                    years - that is, revised in a major way every two years and in a minor way on
                    the off-years. We were constantly working the cycle of decisions on the programs
                    that we needed, and it was a process that was pretty loose when I first got
                    there. It was under development, and it got better and better as it went on, and
                    there were about 10 officers from all the services sort of at the level of
                    lieutenant colonel or commander and colonel - what they call in the military O-6
                    level - who were the assessment directors. Their full-time job at the
                    headquarters, basically, was to review this whole budget cycle, what we needed
                    in the way of equipment, the research process. The head of the acquisition
                    executive, who was a civilian, had vast experience. That was his major
                    responsibility, looking at the programs and connecting them with the various
                    missions of other commands.</p>
                <pb facs="0233" n="Page0233"/>
                <p>Typically what happened was that, as the budget shrank and the services took a
                    number of reductions during the period, we remained pretty constant. Our budget
                    was flatlined, basically, which meant that in terms of inflation we were losing
                    ground. But we lost less comparatively than the services did. But it was a
                    constant struggle to sort of stay ahead of the technology curve. Now we
                    absolutely were determined not to sacrifice readiness. Training was the god that
                    we worshiped, and of course this force, arguably, the readiest of the ready. So
                    training had an enormously high emphasis, and so did structure. In other words,
                    we needed, as we were called upon to do more and more missions around the world,
                    what the military called “force multipliers” - I used to call them “diplomacy
                    multipliers” because increasingly in small countries around the world
                    ambassadors heard about and would ask for Special Forces and Civil Affairs teams
                    to come and do humanitarian civic action, humanitarian de-mining, all kinds of
                    missions that were very helpful to the diplomatic mission of that particular
                    chief of mission, that particular ambassador. So we didn't want to sacrifice
                    force structure. We certainly were not going to sacrifice readiness. So guess
                    what got sacrificed: the development budget. I watched that budget drop from 28
                    percent of the MFP-11 budget (Major Force Program 11 budget) from 28 percent to
                    24 percent during the approximately first three years that I was there. When
                    Hugh Shelton got there and he saw the problem right away, he didn't want to cut
                    back either, but the employment of these forces was just going out of all
                    reason. It was just constantly escalating, and so he capped it and said, “We
                    can't have more than this number of forces deployed abroad.” Because on any
                    given day, there were probably several thousand special operators deployed in as
                    many as sixty or sixty-five countries. Some of them were very small deployments
                    - a half a dozen people - but the problem was that they were spending so much
                    time away from home. One, they were away from their families and, two, they
                    weren't able to retrain. These are people who are trained and trained and
                    retrained intensively. By the time that Pete Schoonmaker, who has now been the
                    commander in chief for about a year and a half, arrived, we had to do something
                    serious about getting rid of the programs that were of marginal use, because we
                    were falling behind in technology.</p>
                <pb facs="0234" n="Page0234"/>
                <p>When I first got there in 1993, they were very proud of saying, “We own the
                    night,” meaning that first of all, that people trained at night continuously,
                    but all the technologies, like night-vision goggles and that sort of thing, they
                    were way ahead of everybody else. But very quickly, within about three years,
                    you could go to your local sports store and buy very good night-vision goggles,
                    and of course the global positioning system communications - that is now
                    available to everybody. So you have to stay ahead. But that also means that
                    you've got to have somebody as a leader of that effort who is experienced and
                    who does have a sort of a future-looking vision of what the shape of the
                    security world will be like and what the mission of the Special Operations
                    Command will be in the years 2010 to 2020 - very difficult to do. Schoonmaker is
                    a remarkable leader in that respect, and so shortly after Schoonmaker arrived,
                    we went through, in our board of directors, a very thorough vetting process of
                    the budget and programs that we had underway at that time, and we basically
                    divided them into five categories, what we called legacy systems (things that we
                    inherited), excess capacity, present systems (that we needed today), things that
                    we would need in 10 years, and then a transition (those things which would get
                    us from today to 10 years out) - those five categories. We were able to identify
                    that way where we could absolutely make some serious decisions on cutting
                    programs without incurring too much risk. We did take some risks, but we had to
                    do that in order to be able to build back up the development budget so that this
                    force, which is very ready today, would be ready to do whatever it was called
                    upon to do 10 years from now.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find yourself putting a more rigorous vetting of
                        requests for assistance from ambassadors and other people? In other words,
                        was your response being cut down towards the end?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Not much, not much. We did cut back a little bit on some of the training
                    because we basically had more than enough. The training budget was from various
                    sources. We had our own training budget. Then the Joint Chiefs had a budget. The
                    chairman had his budget. Then the regional commanders had their budgets. So we
                    found that we were able to reduce by somewhere between 8 and 10 percent of the
                    training budget and still not sacrifice any of the readiness of the force but
                    allow monies to be put in other places and allow people to spend more time at
                    home seeing their families and retraining.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, would you, on a daily basis or something, take a
                        look at the globe and figure out, God, there are some problems here in
                        Algeria. Maybe we've got to be ready to extract people from our embassy
                        there - you know, looking at the situation in Zaire or what have you.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0235" n="Page0235"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, we did that, and we did it in two ways - basically three ways. We
                    did it within OSD. Now here's where you asked me a minute ago how my relations
                    were with the assistant secretary for international security affairs. Well, we
                    worked very closely, because he basically - Frank Kramer - had all of the
                    regions of the world, and at one time we even had a sort of a “hot spots”
                    exercise where, working with the State Department and with DIA, the Defense
                    Intelligence Agency, we would monitor - because we had an intelligence briefing
                    every morning - every morning we got for 20 minutes almost exactly the same
                    intelligence briefing that the Secretary of Defense and the Chairman of the
                    Joint Chiefs of Staff had had half an hour earlier. There were a few very
                    sensitive things which we didn't receive, but I would say 96 percent of what was
                    given to them we got. So that would give us a daily look at what was going on,
                    not only where the armed forces were deployed but also other hot spots. We were
                    monitoring that and thinking about where we might have to get involved. So that
                    was on the civilian side and the intelligence side. All the regional commands,
                    of course, were also looking at the hot areas in their... The European Command
                    had a daunting task because they had not only all of Europe but they also had
                    Africa, so they had a huge responsibility. It was almost overwhelming. In fact,
                    later on they did some redistribution. And then also from the State Department,
                    because we were also getting a certain number of State Department reports and
                    coordinating with them. So we were definitely looking at that. It's not to say
                    that the Special Operations Command had the exclusive responsibility for what we
                    would call NEO's (Noncombatant Evacuation Operations). The Marine Corps did it
                    as well. I mean, it would sort of depend. There was a blowup in Liberia, and the
                    nearest amphibious ready group was six steaming days away, so that was when,
                    right on the heels of the Ron Brown crash site operation, the European Special
                    Operations Command went down and secured the embassy. Every morning - actually
                    several times a day - we would be on a video and audio linkup with the
                    Department of State and with the embassy in Monrovia. Bill Milam was our
                    ambassador there, and he would say, “Well, things are really getting pretty bad
                    here, and we've got a lot of property, we have people here inside the embassy
                    compound, and there are Americans outside who are at risk, and I think it would
                    be good if we could get a little help.” So finally it was decided to send in a
                    platoon of Seals from the European Command. I think there were 18 of them. They
                    didn't do a “rubber duck” operation, which they love to do, because it was right
                    off Mamba Point there in the water. But that can be pretty hazardous, and if you
                    don't have to do it, you don't want to unnecessarily risk losing people. So they
                    actually came in by helicopter at night and basically secured the embassy.
                    Others came in later, some of the Pave Low, the special Air Force Special
                    Operations Command helicopters - they had to take the blades off of them, put
                    them in C-5s, fly them into Sierra Leone, and then we ran a huge rescue
                    operation and evacuated about 2,000 people - not just Americans but
                    third-country nationals as well. The remarkable point of that whole story was...
                    They secured the embassy; they evacuated all of those people; they never had to
                    shoot anybody. They never killed anybody. I thought it was a remarkable
                    testimony to the skill and discipline of these special operators, because the
                    Liberian kids with AK-47's were out of control, and machetes, and they were
                    chopping heads off, and so a Navy Seal would just get somebody - he would see a
                    sniper on a roof, and he would lift his weapon and let the guy see that he had
                    him in his sights, and that was enough. It was sort of using his weapon for
                    psychological purposes. They never shot anybody. It was absolutely remarkable.
                    Anyway, they did a number of operations of that kind. Brazzaville was another
                    one. When things got bad later on in Sierra Leone, there happened to be a small
                    Special Forces training team - six people - and they helped our embassy sort of
                    hunker down and protect them and get them out. Rwanda was another case in
                    point.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you geared up for Rwanda, because there was going to

                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, it stopped because there was a great deal of controversy over what
                    kind of training to give the Rwandans, and there was a lot of conflicting
                    opinion in the NSC over whether to give them lethal training or simply to give
                    them human rights training. I mean it was not a very edifying policy process, I
                    have to say. But there were small groups of special forces people that were in
                    there that were very helpful to the embassy.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0237" n="Page0237"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes. As you know, in the Bush Administration there had been a
                    humanitarian mission launched basically to stop the starvation of the Somali
                    people and to deliver food and to avoid getting sucked into the sort of warlord
                    combat that was going on in Somalia. They did that very well. The Marines and
                    the Army were very disciplined. They avoided the temptation to go in and destroy
                    caches of weapons and some of what they called the “technicals,” which were
                    these basically vehicles that had a crew-served weapon mounted on the back of
                    the vehicle. They avoided that. They protected themselves, and they stuck to the
                    mission, and they delivered the food, and basically they succeeded, and they
                    stopped the starvation. Now in the process of changeover from the Bush
                    Administration to the Clinton Administration and with the introduction and the
                    emergence of a more vigorous UN presence, the mission, unfortunately, changed.
                    It evolved. It was, I think unwisely, decided at a certain point that they would
                    try to capture Aidid, who was the principal warlord in Somalia. Special
                    Operations Command was given the mission. It was tasked to send a task force. I
                    think it was called Task Force 160, which was a combination of helicopters and
                    helicopter pilots and commandos to go in and basically capture this guy and
                    carry out a number of missions. Well, it was a very difficult and frustrating
                    mission because they didn't have good intelligence on the ground. Basically,
                    between the time when we closed our embassy and the time we went back in there
                    with the humanitarian mission under the Bush Administration, we had lost all of
                    our intelligence connections, and it's very difficult to set something up in a
                    matter of weeks. So they weren't getting good intelligence as to where the
                    various people were in this sort of rabbit warren of downtown Mogadishu. They
                    had to carry out their missions. When they got tip-offs they tended to be in the
                    daytime, and they had to move fast. They'd prefer to operate at night, but they
                    operated in the daytime. They did a few things. They picked up a few people and
                    were able to bring them back and arrest them, but they were absolutely
                    determined - and ordered - to go after Aidid. At a certain point - I think it
                    was in October of 1993 - this mission took place where they were surprised when
                    they went into this one place in this sort of area of tiny little streets where
                    Aidid's people were basically in command. They were trying to get him at a
                    hotel, and one of their helicopters was shot down, and then a second one was
                    hit, and then things went from bad to worse. You remember the famous photograph
                    of one of the helicopter pilots who was stripped naked and he was dead and he
                    was dragged through the streets. There was another helicopter pilot named
                    Durand. His helicopter was down, and he was wounded and had some ammunition, but
                    was running out of ammunition. His crew chief was dead, and two special Army
                    commandos volunteered. They asked three times and were told no, and then on the
                    third day they were allowed to go in. They knew they were sacrificing
                    themselves. They fast-roped into this area to protect him and stayed with him
                    until their ammunition ran out, and they were both killed. It was rather
                    unusual, they were both awarded a Congressional Medal of Honor. Durand was taken
                    prisoner, but in the ensuing negotiations, he was released, and he's back flying
                    with the 160th Special Operations Aviation Regiment today. But we had a lot of
                    losses. I think we lost something like 19 dead and about 80 wounded in that
                    operation.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0238" n="Page0238"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Oh, yes, these were exclusively troops from the special operations
                    command, and the fighting was absolutely ferocious. And again, it was bad
                    intelligence. Nobody had any idea how many grenade launchers the RPGs,
                    rocket-propelled grenades, were in the hands of Aidid's people. I've talked to
                    some of the pilots that were on that mission, and they said it was like a
                    blizzard. It was a blizzard of RPGs. It wasn't that they were necessarily
                    terrific marksmen, but there were so many of them massed, and they were just
                    firing in volleys that it was a ferocious battle, and they had these losses.
                    They withdrew the following day. It went on more than a day. It went part of a
                    day, through the night, and into the next day. They finally withdrew to the
                    airport in open vehicles and took a lot of fire as they were withdrawing.</p>
                <p>But anyway, when the operation was over, this had a traumatic effect on the
                    Clinton Administration, and there was a huge investigation, and I arrived on the
                    scene just about that time, about two weeks afterwards. I had met Wayne Downing,
                    who was then the commander in chief of the Special Operations Command, but Major
                    General Bill Garrison, who had commanded the unit that went to Somalia - he and
                    Wayne Downing came by my office to do sort of a dress rehearsal, a dry run, of
                    the briefing that we all then went and gave in the presence of Secretary Aspen
                    to Senator John Warner and Senator Levin, who had been designated by Sam Nunn,
                    who was then the chairman, to conduct a searching investigation of this action
                    in Mogadishu. So that's where I came in, a few weeks after this had
                    happened.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, during the Kosovo crisis or just before, some of the
                        Serb commanders, when talking to our people when we were trying to get them
                        to be nicer to the Kosovars, would throw the figure 18 at them, which was I
                        think their reckoning of how many special forces we'd lost in Mogadishu.
                        What they were saying was, “Look, your army is so delicate now because of
                        public opinion that all we have to do is kill 18 people and you're out of
                        it, so don't bluff us that you're going to do anything.” I mean, was that an
                        element in your planning, decision-making, and everything else?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0239" n="Page0239"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, that hung like a bad cloud over the American national security
                    scene for a very long time. As a matter of fact, it wasn't too long after that
                    that we were trying to send a sort of a civil affairs peacekeeping mission into
                    Haiti, and there was a ship called the Harlan County - you may remember - that
                    was steaming into Port-au-Prince, and there was a bit of a riot on the docks. In
                    retrospect, I think our people were alarmed by this riot, but it isn't as if
                    they were butchering people on the docks. It was a riot. But because of that,
                    people in Washington gave the order to turn the Harlan County away. I mean they
                    were looking at another potential Mogadishu, they thought. In other words, they
                    were looking at it through Somali eyeglasses, and they were frightened by what
                    might happen because of this tremendous public opinion reaction to the battle of
                    Mogadishu. Well, just about everybody in the Pentagon and certainly the
                    commander in chief of the Atlantic Command was just furious at this sort of
                    pusillanimous reaction. Of course, we later recovered and actually carried out a
                    pretty major mission in Haiti. But you're absolutely right. This problem - and
                    it still exists today... It is born in part out of the Gulf War - that we
                    conducted in the Bush Administration this extraordinary warfare with absolutely
                    minimal losses, and there's a perception now in the United States that it's
                    possible, because we're so powerful and have all these weapons and accurate
                    missiles and bombs, that it's possible to carry out an operation with no losses

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This has been reinforced because of our 78 days of bombing
                        in Serbia and Kosovo we didn't take a single loss. This was great, but at

                <p>HOLMES: It was a false impression, and one reason we didn't take any losses was
                    that we flew so high - basically to protect the pilots. We had a couple of
                    pilots, by the way, that did get hit. There was a Stealth fighter and another
                    aircraft, which I think was a- (end of tape)</p>

                        doing things. Was there concern, not so much at the Secretary of Defense
                        level, about the support you'd get and all about the White House? I mean,
                        Clinton had not served in the military, and he was seen as... and not just
                        Clinton but the people around him as being almost anti-military and not very
                        good at using military. Was that a perception?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0240" n="Page0240"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, that situation improved during the life of the Clinton
                    Administration. Certainly, it's absolutely clear from the record, and we all saw
                    it, that Clinton got off on the wrong foot with the military. The first thing
                    was the whole issue about the gays and how to handle that issue. I remember
                    there was an incident where Barry McCaffrey, the most decorated American
                    serviceman in uniform - two Distinguished Service Crosses from service in
                    Vietnam - terribly wounded in Vietnam, spent a year being operated on
                    continually to rebuild his body in Walter Reed Hospital, this incredibly gallant
                    soldier, shows up - at that point he's a three-star, a lieutenant general, the
                    J-5 in the Joint Staff. He shows up at the White House for a meeting - he has to
                    go to a meeting - and he encounters a couple of young Clinton aides who
                    basically are very rude to him and say that they don't like to see military
                    people in uniform in the Clinton White House. This got into the newspapers. It
                    was quite a celebrated case. The President, I must say, to his credit, saw that
                    this was unfair to this guy, and so he made a point later on on a trip, where
                    McCaffrey was also present, of jogging with him and had the press see this
                    happen. I must say that since that very low point, the way the Clinton
                    Administration started off, the President himself made a huge effort and, I
                    think, a largely successful one, in making our service people feel that he was
                    their commander-in-chief. I mean he visited them in the field. He would go and
                    have Thanksgiving dinner with them in various places. Troops love to be visited,
                    and they appreciated that. I think he won adherence. He won a lot of loyalty
                    from the forces. But nonetheless, that said, we are in an era today - let's face
                    it - where the body of people with military experience, people who are veterans
                    of war or have even served in the military, are a vanishing breed. I mean today
                    you have the unusual situation, for example, where not only the President, the
                    commander-in-chief who didn't do military service, but neither the Secretary of
                    Defense nor the deputy secretary of defense did military service. Bill Perry
                    did, but Bill Cohen didn't, and neither did John Hamre, who's today's deputy
                    secretary. Of course, that's happening in the Congress as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0241" n="Page0241"/>
                <p>HOLMES: So you have a whole new generation of young leaders that are coming into
                    office that have no military experience, don't understand the culture, and don't
                    quite know how to use the national security apparatus as an underpinning. Now
                    that said, and that does present problems, and what is ironic is this problem of
                    having a casualty-free military exercise, because it's really quite ironic
                    because, first of all, it's a volunteer force. We're not talking about a draft
                    today. Everybody who goes into the armed forces today must know or certainly is
                    told that at some point in their career they may be put in harm's way, and
                    they're volunteering to do that. Most of them accept that. Certainly going into
                    the Gulf War there were only a handful of people that, I think, refused to go
                    and said, “We didn't sign up to go into combat; we signed up to get a college
                    degree at night time with the help of the military.” But our military are
                    absolutely prepared to go into harm's way and to do the job that they are hired
                    and trained to do. It's basically the fear of political repercussions. Of
                    course, in this age of instant communications - and the press is everywhere - it
                    basically has an almost paralyzing effect on some political leaders today. It's
                    true, because in other democracies we don't have the same.. The French, for
                    example, have a rather high tolerance for losses. People forget that the French
                    stood up and did their job in Bosnia long before we got there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, under the UN, and they took real losses.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: The French and the British. The French, I think, lost in total something
                    like 60 or 70 people in fighting, carrying out that very unpleasant... during
                    the UN protection force era. So they have more of a tolerance. The British have
                    more of a tolerance as well. The Germans, remarkably - I mean the Germans have a
                    very special problem because of the baggage from World War II, and now we're
                    seeing for the first time German infantry actually deployed in Kosovo, which is
                    a quite remarkable evolution. But we have a problem in that ___________. There's
                    no question about it. We have a serious problem because we lose more people in
                    training in the United States. We lose a lot of people, because our people train
                    hard. There are accidents - regrettable, and you try to avoid them, but it's a
                    serious problem, because we are going to be called upon more and more, and some
                    of the missions are political-military missions. They're humanitarian missions,
                    as we're seeing today in Kosovo. That's a humanitarian mission, but it's
                    dangerous as hell.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Two Gurkhas. First losses in that. Let's talk about
                        Bosnia, because this is the big thing for you when you were there - you
                        know, the thing - how did that develop from your perspective? Were we sort
                        of sitting on the sidelines thinking about, Gee, we're going to go in
                        sometime, making plans, but... You know, at first we were saying this is a
                        European operation; let them take care of it, and all that. What was your
                        perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: My perspective is that I think that when the Clinton Administration came
                    into office, they did a very poor job of assuming the mantle of leadership in
                    the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. When Secretary of State Warren
                    Christopher made his first trip after coming into office to the North Atlantic
                    Council, he announced that he was there to listen. I found this absolutely
                    extraordinary. The allies didn't quite know what to make of it, because
                    traditionally they gripe, they complain, they fight, they quarrel, they leak to
                    the press about the heavy-handedness of the United States, but they expect the
                    United States to lead. This is the way it's always been, and here comes the
                    Secretary of State who says he's there to listen. For the first year,
                    approximately - maybe more than a year, closer to maybe to a year and a half -
                    of the Clinton Administration, I would say that the Administration is guilty of
                    default of leadership in NATO. I'm giving you this sort of back-looking
                    perspective because I think it has a lot to do with what we eventually ended up
                    doing in Bosnia. In other words, there were two force lines that emerged, that
                    resulted in our commitment to the Bosnia peacekeeping operation known as IFOR.
                    One was, of course, the Dayton Accords, but the other was this very wobbly NATO
                    leadership. I believe that by the time that decision was made, it was understood
                    that we had done a poor job of leading NATO, despite the strong efforts of
                    SACEUR, of General Shalikashvili and the Partnership for Peace, which was I
                    think a great undertaking. But we had done a poor job. We had criticized the UN
                    protection force and our allies were in there, and they wanted us to be there
                    but we weren't. So finally, it seems to me that this was an opportunity not only
                    to try to do something about putting some stability back into the Balkans as a
                    result of the Dayton Accords, but also it was a question of NATO leadership. So
                    we went into that - finally - and I was, frankly, very pleased to see us take
                    our natural place in that effort, with three zones carved out, one by us, one by
                    the British, and one by the French, with the overall command being an American
                    officer. It was the way it should have been at the beginning, in my view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there a certain amount of restiveness as we watched
                        this thing develop, particularly the Serbs were bullying the UN - it's the
                        only way. I mean, here were you know I mean they were humiliating these
                        peacekeepers by including killing a vice president of Bosnia in a French
                        troop carrier.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, it was very restive, and people were very upset. I remember a small
                    Dutch platoon that was at a killing spree in Srebrenica, which was-</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0243" n="Page0243"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, you know, they were surrounded by a thousand
                        bloodlust troops, and they were something like a platoon or so, and there
                        really wasn't much they could do, but they shouldn't have been put in that
                        position.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: They shouldn't have been put in that position, and the Dutch were angry.
                    They were angry, humiliated, and determined to get back into things. Then later
                    on, of course, they did participate in arresting some of the war criminals in
                    Bosnia. But it was a very bad situation, and it really only changed after the
                    Dayton Accords. Of course we did the bombing, that first bombing run, which
                    brought them to the table and resulted in the agreement - with Milosevic, of
                    course, participating. But that finally worked out, and I must say, by the time
                    I visited Bosnia, for the first and only time in the last summer, the summer of
                    1998, I went and visited our Special Operations Forces in Italy, Brindisi,
                    Sarajevo, went up to Tuzla and then to Brcko and then on to Europe, Stuttgart
                    and the United Kingdom. Things had really turned around by that time, and they
                    were operating extremely well together, not only in the American sector but also
                    with their British and French and Italian and other NATO allies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would have thought that there would be a problem in our
                        special operations because we had such a high degree of using technology - I
                        mean it's extremely important - and equipment. I would have thought that,
                        say, particularly the British, the French and the Germans would be maybe one
                        step down or something like that. Or how did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0244" n="Page0244"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, actually, curiously, I'm going to say something that may surprise
                    you. The thing that marks the difference is really the quality of the people,
                    much more than the equipment, because actually the British and the French are
                    pretty well equipped as well, but it's the quality of the training. I think that
                    your average US special operator - that one who stays for a while, the senior
                    noncommissioned officer - he's probably had $200,000 of training put in him -
                    per individual. I saw this in Brcko, when I visited... I don't know if I
                    recounted this in an earlier session, but in Brcko I visited what was called a
                    Joint Commission Operations house - JCO. In Brcko, in just a regular little
                    house, living in the community, were eight US special forces soldiers wearing
                    uniforms, the fatigues, BDUs, without any rank or unit insignia. All they had on
                    their uniforms was US ARMY and their name. The reason for that was that they
                    were all so competent and they didn't want people that they were working with to
                    know who's the officer or who's the senior non-commissioned officer. They were
                    all sergeants, one warrant officer, and a young captain. Between them they had a
                    remarkable assemblage of language skills. Among the eight they had
                    Serbo-Croatian, German, Russian, Ukrainian, French, and Polish - terrific
                    assembly there, number of European languages. They were able to go around, and
                    they would go around without helmets or Kevlar vests or weapons. They would go
                    around in pairs, either on foot or in a vehicle, and just make themselves known
                    and get to know the various ethnic communities and talk to them and find out
                    what their problems were. They would frequently be called in to sort of
                    adjudicate little neighborhood squabbles. It was a remarkable operation. This
                    was really based on the quality of the people, that they were able to do that in
                    their training. They were the eyes and ears of the IFOR or SFOR command in
                    Sarajevo. Tthey would report back what was going on, and they'd talk with the US
                    ambassador there, who was a kind of an international civil servant trying to
                    adjudicate problems at the sort of government level in Brcko.</p>
                <p>This was a successful effort, and the other allies began to take up that mission,
                    because we had those little JCO houses scattered throughout Bosnia, but we
                    didn't have enough people, and eventually the British and French decided they
                    were going to do the same thing, so there was a great deal of coordination and
                    sort of cross-training and discussion with our allies. The French have now a
                    special operations force, a command that is designed along the lines of the US
                    command. In fact, when they set it up, in about 1993-94, they spent a lot of
                    time in Tampa talking with the leadership down there of the Special Operations
                    and to see how they did it. So it's sort of modeled on the US model. They were
                    very selective and put a lot of emphasis on training. But they are in an early
                    phase of their development because they are encountering the same resistance
                    that our people did from their regular forces and not used as much as they
                    should be. The British, of course, have a longer tradition. The SAS and their
                    special boat units had been in business for a long time, and they don't have the
                    same problems.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any thought about, you know, we were trying this

                <pb facs="0245" n="Page0245"/>
                <p>HOLMES: Yes, there was. This is another mission that the Special Operations
                    Command has, which is what they call liaison missions with foreign forces. In
                    fact, Norman Schwarzkopf called them “The glue that kept the alliance together”
                    in the desert war, because they had these little teams that, using their
                    language skills, went out to the various allied commands. Probably for the first
                    time since World War II we actually ended up in Bosnia with a Russian unit
                    assigned to an American officer, with a sort of tortuous chain of command. The
                    European special operations command recruited a young, fluent Russian-speaking
                    Special Forces captain, who was assigned with a communicator and an intelligence
                    NCO - a small team of three or four people - to be assigned to the Russian
                    headquarters, and they made a difference in terms of connecting that Russian
                    unit with the US command - fluent Russian-speaking. They provided them with
                    communications with this command, with intelligence, and a certain understanding
                    of how the US Army and the NATO force was operating in the field, and made a
                    huge difference. So that was successful, and they went instinctively, by design,
                    the commander-in-chief of our forces in Europe turned to that command because
                    they knew that that was the place to recruit the right kind of coalition support
                    team.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling you were getting from the Pentagon
                        about the expansion of NATO, to Poland, to Hungary, to the Czech
                        Republic?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: Well, of course, they supported it, because at that time, the chairman of
                    the Joint Chiefs of Staff was John Shalikashvili, who had been a very successful
                    SACEUR in Europe and who actually came up... He was the father of the idea of
                    the Partnership for Peace. Now there were some people, and I'm one of them, that
                    had a different view - that it wasn't necessary to expand the Alliance so
                    quickly and to risk having an increasingly clumsy organization. As it was at 16,
                    with a consensus rule at the heart of NATO decisions, it was very difficult to
                    operate, and we could see what was happening. Now it's 19 and growing. Our
                    feeling was that it wasn't necessary to move so rapidly - I mean the people that
                    saw it the way I did, that the partnership for peace should have been something
                    that had much more body and mission attached to it. It could have been part of a
                    very long vetting process. In other words, by having non-NATO European allies -
                    the new ones from the old Warsaw Pact - participate in Partnership for Peace
                    exercises, they could have learned from the prospect, they could have seen what
                    was required over the long pull to become a fully participating member of the
                    Alliance, and they could have acquired a kind of an associate status with the
                    Alliance - and giving them already a sense of community which would have
                    psychologically given them some sense of ease vis-�-vis Russia, which is one
                    reason they all wanted to get into NATO quickly - without encumbering the
                    alliance with all of the liabilities that we have seen by the early entry of
                    these countries. But of course the decision went elsewhere and was made.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It was a major domestic political imperative in this one,

                <p>HOLMES: There was. My own feeling was that it was not necessary, that there was
                    another way to do this that would have been a more gradual process and more
                    manageable over the long term, but anyway, it was done. You know, there were
                    different views in the Pentagon, but once the decision was made, people just put
                    their shoulders to it and made it work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, Allen, is there anything else we should cover, do
                        you think?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>HOLMES: I don't think so. I think we've pretty well sketched the landscape of
                    what was going on - except to say that... I just might finish by saying that I
                    really do believe that if you look back over the last five years at what the
                    armed forces of the United States have been doing, basically political-military
                    work, led by, not exclusively done by but led by, the Special Operations Forces,
                    the kind of work, counter-terrorism, counter-drug, civic and humanitarian
                    assistance, disaster relief, peacekeeping - all these activities, which are
                    basically civil military responses to complex humanitarian crises of different
                    varieties around the world, this is what the armed forces have been doing. Now
                    there's a very interesting debate that is already underway as to whether this is
                    appropriate. Is this what the armed forces should be doing? Is this an
                    appropriate use of the members of the armed forces and of the budget of the
                    Defense Department, to get increasingly involved in this kind of work abroad and
                    to some degree domestically? There is a lot of discussion going on now about
                    homeland defense, and so I think there has been an early chapter where they have
                    proven to be of benefit to the country, not just as the security underpinning of
                    foreign policy, but at a higher level of engagement very much involved with the
                    Department of State, AID, and other agencies of our government in the conduct of
                    foreign relations. I think there's a good question that remains now: is this
                    going to be the pattern as we go into the 21st century? Should it be? Should we
                    resist it? Should we maintain a more traditional view of the preparation and
                    equipping of our armed forces? Should it be more strategic? These are unanswered
                    questions.</p>
