                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Today is the 6th of January, 1998. This is an interview
                        with Lacy A. Wright, Jr. This is being done on behalf of the Association for
                        Diplomatic Studies and Training, and I'm Charles Stuart Kennedy. Lacy and I
                        are old colleagues from Vietnam. Lacy, let's start at the beginning. Can you
                        tell me where and when you were born and something about your family.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I was born in Springfield, Illinois, on July 1, 1940. I was the first of
                    five children, all boys. My mother was born in Springfield; my father was born
                    not very far away, about 175 miles away in West Frankfort, Illinois. And I grew
                    up, I spent my entire youth in Springfield, leaving to go to college, and I've
                    not lived there since.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your father doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: My father worked for the Allis Chalmers tractor company, which at that
                    time had a large plant in Springfield.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I assume your mother, having five boys, was occupied
                        raising five boys.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: That's right. She never worked in the sense that women work today. She
                    stayed home and raised her children.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You went to elementary and high school?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0002" n="Page0002"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: I went to Catholic schools. I went to a Catholic grade school, St. Peter
                    and Paul's, which had a German tradition, probably still the best school for the
                    money that I ever went to in my life. I shouldn't say “for the money” because it
                    cost a dollar a month tuition, and it was a superb school. I went then to a
                    boys' high school in Springfield, and then I studied to be a priest. I went into
                    the seminary in Springfield for a year, then to Chicago for three years, and
                    then I studied in Rome for a couple of years before I dropped out of that and
                    came back to the United States.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, going back to the elementary and, particularly, the
                        high school area, were you getting much in the way of foreign affairs or
                        something in which you would become much involved later on as a Foreign
                        Service officer? Were you getting anything in that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I would not say too much. In the Midwest in those days, and I think that
                    it may not have changed all that much even now, there was a tremendous
                    concentration on domestic affairs. I can remember in my 30's talking to one of
                    the officers on the Chicago Tribune. He told me that even in that very well
                    known paper the space devoted to foreign affairs was tiny as opposed to domestic
                    affairs. So I think that that outlook obtained throughout my youth. I did not
                    even become aware of the Foreign Service until I went to Rome to study, and then
                    I had a friend who knew somebody in the American embassy, and that was my first
                    contact with embassies and with the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In high school, what did you read and what were your
                        interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I was interested in plays. I was interested in literature. There was a
                    tremendous emphasis on sports in those days, and I was interested in a minor way
                    in playing and in a major way in being a follower and a spectator, but those
                    were the days when for example in my milieu there could be nothing more
                    magnificent that could happen to a human being but that he would go to Notre
                    Dame and play football. That was the acme. And places farther afield, Harvard
                    and other Ivy League schools were way out somewhere in the firmament.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was high school a Catholic school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: It was. It was run by a small order of priests called the Viatorians, who
                    were centered, I believe in Chicago. Our school was about 400 students at that
                    time, and in retrospect, I think they did a good job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find in later life that being brought up in a
                        Parochial school was parochial in its aspect, or were you getting a pretty
                        good basis or broader view of the world.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0003" n="Page0003"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: I think we got the basics for a good view of the world. We certainly
                    learned basics in the sense of having a superb foundation in the English
                    language, which is rarer and rarer today. I suppose where we might have been
                    deficient was in critical thinking, in the sense that Catholicism, particularly
                    as it was practiced in those days, is a religion which knows all the answers, at
                    least to all the important questions, and so there was no impetus coming from
                    one's teachers to be critical about the things that were taught by the church.
                    And I suppose that that must be seen as a deficiency of that kind of
                    education.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One hears about “Jesuitical” education, which is one of
                        examining things, which is a different approach from what I gather you were
                        taught, or is it the same side of the coin?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, I think the Jesuits like to perpetuate the view that what they have
                    is peculiar and special, but I'm not sure that it really is. The Jesuits had a
                    longer period of education than other priests did, and they produced a number of
                    very [fine] scholars, and they prided themselves on that kind of emphasis.
                    However, they, as other Catholics, believed essentially in the same
                    things—totally in the same things. I think that they as a group put more
                    emphasis on the scholarly and, as I say, were active in perpetuating the view
                    that they were awfully darn good at it. Some of them were, and some of them less
                    so. But I wouldn't want to exaggerate the differences between what might be
                    called a Jesuitical approach and what was the approach of other Catholics.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well then, after high school you say you went to seminary.
                        Where was that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I went first to a local one-year school called the Diocesan Latin School.
                    This was an institution which was run by the Diocese of Springfield, Illinois,
                    which had a very small enrollment, perhaps, oh, between ten and 20 students at
                    any one time, and we then after completing that year, which was, by the way,
                    devoted almost totally to the learning of Latin, because in those days, this
                    would have been 1959, when you went to what was called the “major” seminary—that
                    is, what we would call college or university—many of the courses were literally
                    taught in Latin. The teachers spoke in Latin, and so you couldn't take those
                    unless your Latin was up to a certain standard. So most of that year was spent
                    learning Latin. There was some Greek and there were a few other things, but
                    primarily Latin.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: By the way, while you were still in Springfield, did one
                        get a heavy dose of Lincoln there? I was just wondering. I never knew
                        anybody who came up from Springfield.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0004" n="Page0004"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes and no. I guess it's akin to living in New York and having somebody
                    ask you if you're an expert on the Empire State Building. You probably aren't.
                    Of course, we knew, I guess, a little bit more about Lincoln than other people,
                    but I would not by any means say that being from Springfield entitles you to
                    discourse about Abraham Lincoln. At the same time, he's always, to me, been a
                    great president and a fascinating character, and I try to take whatever chances
                    I have to learn more about him.Q: So where did you go then for your major
                    education?</p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I went to Chicago or, more specifically, to a town above Chicago called
                    Mundelein, Illinois, which is near Libertyville, where Adlai Stevenson comes
                    from, a town of, I don't know, 10,000 to 30,000. And the main feature of which
                    in those days was a very large—indeed grandiose in its grounds— seminary
                    belonging to the Archdiocese of Chicago. That was a much larger institution, and
                    it accepted students not only from Chicago but from elsewhere in Illinois. It
                    had been founded by Cardinal Mundelein, hence the name, and it was essentially
                    two schools in one. It was the final three years of one's Philosophy, and at the
                    end of that you got a B.A. in philosophy. And then you went on, if you stayed at
                    Mundelein, for four years in theology, at the end of which you were ordained a
                    priest.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the Archdiocese of Chicago? I'm not a Catholic,
                        but I went to school for a while to Boston University, and you got very much
                        aware of what the archdiocese is in Boston, a rather autocratic, very Irish
                        tradition at that time. Were you picking up any of the spirit of the
                        Archdiocese of Chicago at that point?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, and it was more or less as you describe it. It was a very
                    conservative institution. Indeed, most of Chicago Catholicism was very
                    conservative, but in those days, as I'm sure the same exists today, with the
                    number of people, students and others, who were much more progressive and who
                    were trying to do things in a new way, particularly in the social field... Don't
                    forget that in a few years you would have Pope John XXIII and the Vatican II
                    council with a number of new ideas coming out of that which would both change
                    the liturgy of the Church (for example, do away with the Latin mass) and impinge
                    upon the social teaching of the Church. For example, I remember when I was at
                    Mundelein, or maybe this was a little bit after that, one of the things that
                    then went on was the civil rights movement in the South. And I can remember that
                    one of my classmates, a year ahead of me, by the name of Dick Morrisrow, went to
                    the South and marched at one of those places—Selma or one of the others—and was
                    shot by police or a local law enforcement officer and very badly wounded. And
                    I've not seen him in many years, but I'm told that he carries those wounds
                    around to this day and was very fortunate not to have been killed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left Mundelein when, in what year?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0005" n="Page0005"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: I left Mundelein in 1962. That is, I did not finish my theology at
                    Mundelein, but I was sent instead by the Archdiocese of Springfield to complete
                    my studies in Rome at the North American College there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why this change?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: It was considered an honor to be sent to Rome. The North American College
                    in Rome is a creation of the American Church; that is, it is supported by all of
                    the dioceses in the United States. At that time, it had about 300 to 400
                    students from all over the United States, and it was traditional that dioceses
                    would send up to two students a year to Rome. For example, that's what Chicago
                    did. Chicago was a large archdiocese; they sent two people. A smaller diocese,
                    like mine, Springfield, didn't necessarily send somebody every year, but it did
                    in that year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there in Rome from '62 to—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: —'65, when I quit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: '62 to '65. When did Pope John XXIII come in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: It was probably 1959 that he came in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Some of the changes were beginning to take hold at this
                        point, weren't they?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Don't forget, though, that Vatican II had not occurred yet. Vatican II
                    did not occur until, I believe, 1962, and John XXIII, by the way, only reigned,
                    I think, for about five years.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was going to say, it was a short but extremely
                        influential reign. As a political officer, you were there at a very
                        interesting time, and what was your impression of the impression of these
                        doings on you and your fellow theological seminarians.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, there was a tremendous amount of interest in what was going on at
                    the council, and our college was only a stone's throw, literally, from St.
                    Peter's and the Vatican, where these meetings were held. And during our time
                    there, when these meetings were in session, all of the bishops of the world
                    came, and so every student there had as a visitor his own bishop or archbishop
                    or cardinal. Some of the more illustrious of them stayed in the North American
                    College. I believe Cardinal Spellman stayed there.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: From New York.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: From New York. Cardinal Cushing of Boston also, and other notable people
                    from the American Church. And they would speak to us, from time to time, in our
                    college, and so it was a time of a great deal of intellectual ferment. I would
                    say that a lot of this had to do with things that many people would consider
                    esoteric, if not frivolous, but they were things that were of a lot of
                    importance to people who were going to make their careers in the Church. Much of
                    it was liturgical, for example.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you sensing problems with your teachers, who were
                        basically trained to teach one way and while the revolution was almost
                        happening a stone's throw away? I mean, was this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I guess it was a bit of a problem. Our teachers were, by the way, famous
                    Jesuits. We did not go to school at the North American College. That was
                    residence. We went to school at the Gregorian University, which is still there
                    and which is a Jesuit-run institution and one of the most well endowed,
                    intellectually, and best all-around of the Catholic seminaries in the world.
                    But, as you imply, it was by and large a conservative institution with, however,
                    smatterings of progressivity as well. There were, of course, a lot of struggles.
                    These were played out right in the council itself, struggles between, say, the
                    Italian bishops, who were by and large very conservative, and others, like the
                    French, who were by and large much more liberal, much more willing to change and
                    adapt themselves to the times. Within the American Church you had the same
                    thing. You had a majority, I would say, of the hierarchy that was conservative,
                    but there were a number of others who were not. So this kind of struggle between
                    the old and the new was being played out all over the place.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Looking at this—I don't know whether you could at the
                        time—was there any feeling of difference between being an American Catholic
                        candidate for priesthood, a French, and Italian—I mean, you were seeing
                        others who were coming to their various schools from around there—was there
                        much mixing, was there any, sort of, either ranking or putting them on a
                        Catholic spectrum or what have you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0007" n="Page0007"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: There was a good deal of mixing. Most of us were anxious, for example, to
                    learn Italian, so we would pair up with an Italian who wanted to learn English.
                    Same in French, same in some of the other languages. So there was a great
                    willingness to mix. There was a great desire to learn. After all, we were young
                    people; we were in a different country, so there was a great desire to learn
                    about what went on elsewhere. And I think that was reciprocated with the other
                    students. One interesting sidelight was that we, coming from the United
                    States—and I believe this is carried over into our diplomacy and into our
                    general behavior—we tend to be the people who obeyed the laws and the rules the
                    best. The Italian clergy and students, perhaps because familiarity breeds
                    contempt, were often out of uniform, often obeyed the rules in the breach, but
                    not the Americans. And I believe that we were considered by some na�ve to have
                    taken that general approach, but we did. And again, I think that is something,
                    though, that I saw then played out again and again in our diplomatic
                    establishments, where we took local law a good deal more seriously than the
                    locals did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I know exactly what you mean. Well, as this went on, after
                        Vatican II, were there changes in your training?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I would not say that there were a lot of direct changes, although I must
                    say that I haven't thought about this before. Certainly there were changes going
                    on, for example, in the way that Biblical studies were carried out, which I'm
                    sure owed a lot to the spirit of what was going on at the council. There were
                    new interpretations of the Bible; there was, of course, a great flight from the
                    fundamentalist view that takes the Bible literally, although I don't know that
                    you could attribute that to what was going on at the council, but it was the
                    same direction, it was the same spirit that prevailed there. And I think that
                    that was played out also in the teaching of moral theology and in a number of
                    the other subjects that were taught at the Gregorian. So yes, I think you could,
                    in that sense, say that the spirit that prevailed then was finding its way into
                    the way courses were taught.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this period, were you getting any preparation for
                        parish life? I'm thinking of the social service—psychology, bookkeeping,
                        particularly what I'll call the delivery of social services, which later
                        became a large part of what happened particularly in Latin American, all
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0008" n="Page0008"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: I would say not very much, and I would say that that's part of the old
                    order that was still around, and I would suspect that that has changed a lot
                    today. You got some, however, that is, some nod in the direction of giving you
                    some practical training that you might need later. There were programs for newly
                    ordained priests and those about to be ordained, whereby they would go to
                    parishes in Rome and work on a Sunday and conduct certain activities, that kind
                    of thing. As far as any kind of practical psychological training, I would say
                    not; and that has to be seen as a deficiency of the old way that things were
                    done. It was assumed that if you learned what the church's teachings were, you
                    would pick all that stuff up along the way, a view that's now regarded as
                    antiquated.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What caused you to move away from the profession of the
                        priesthood?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, I would say that, in general, the life of a priest is a very odd
                    one, odd in the sense that it is out of step with people who lead so-called
                    normal lives. The most striking instance of this, of course, is that priests
                    lead celibate lives, and that alone is enough to drive most people who leave
                    away from that calling. However, I would say that, although it's extremely
                    important and, indeed, the most important aspect of what I'm talking about, it's
                    a broader phenomenon when you're in this kind of life, and especially when
                    you're a young person and you are very keen to be doing the kinds of things that
                    other people are doing and when you're starting out in life and wanting to
                    experiment with things. So I would say that, in general, it was the uncommon,
                    the odd quality of the life that priests were called upon to lead, the separate
                    nature of it as symbolized most strikingly in the question of celibacy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this happening to almost the same percentage each
                        year, who would drift away, or was this a spirit of the times? We're talking
                        about the '60's now, and things were really beginning to shake up all over
                        the place.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Something new was happening. Now, I don't have any statistics here to
                    buttress what I'm saying, but you always had a very large number of people who
                    would leave during their training, as I did. What became new, I would say
                    starting with those classes, was the departure of a number of priests, people
                    who had already been ordained and then decided to leave. So for example, in my
                    class, many of the members of which I keep up with, let us say there were maybe
                    100 people ordained at the end in Rome, or perhaps fewer, 70, let's say; well
                    over 50 per cent of those have now left the priesthood. That would not have been
                    the case 50 or 75 years ago.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While you were in Rome, were your eyes and interests
                        turning elsewhere? It obviously was a tremendous crisis of the soul, and
                        all. I'm not being facetious on this; it really is. But was something else
                        tugging you towards what you wanted to do with yourself?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0009" n="Page0009"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: I would say not. I would say that I was so tied up in the question that
                    you just alluded to, that is, whether to go or whether to stay, that it crowded
                    out a lot of other things. However, at the same time, I was learning new things.
                    I was becoming more and more enamored of the life of travel, of learning
                    languages, and then shortly before I left Rome, I met some people from the
                    American embassy and became aware of diplomacy and the Foreign Service. So I
                    think that despite my preoccupation with my own problems, other things were
                    creeping in that would later prove influential in what I did.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you at all aware of Papal diplomacy at the time, or
                        was that just way off somewhere else?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Both. It was way off somewhere else, but I was aware of it, in fact,
                    because I had a very close friend, an American, who was studying in the Vatican
                    diplomatic school. So I was aware that there was such a place, and I knew one or
                    two of the people who went there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you leave the North American school?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I left in May of 1965, and I went back to Illinois. I went home first,
                    and then I went Chicago, and my aim was to continue my schooling, and I can't
                    quite remember whether at that point I wanted to go into the Foreign Service,
                    but I may have. And I went to school that summer at Loyola University, and I
                    took foreign affairs kinds of course, and then I taught high school the
                    following year at a Catholic high school on the North Side of Chicago and also
                    continued to go to school part time. And then during that year I took the
                    Foreign Service exam and I passed it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm just going on supposition, but I would have thought
                        that studying Latin, studying theology and all—I mean, in a way it seems
                        like a very narrow band of studies, and the Foreign Service exam is designed
                        to have somebody with a broad superficial knowledge and not a concentrated
                        knowledge. How did you bring yourself up to speed? Were you doing reading on
                        the side? How did this come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, I was doing my best. As I say, I was taking some foreign affairs
                    courses in the months leading up to that. I was doing my best to prepare for the
                    exams, although that was not very easy because of the quality of the exam which
                    you just mentioned, but somehow I did it. One of the interesting things, when
                    the results of the written part of the exam came back, was that I didn't pass
                    any of the parts by very much. Some of that didn't surprise me. What did
                    surprise me was that the area where I thought I was really pretty super in,
                    which is English, I also didn't pass by much. But at any rate, I did pass.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Had you during your studies been exposed to the daily
                        newspapers? I mean, was this part of your reading?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: No, and in fact, one of the features of life at Mundelein, which is hard
                    to comprehend today is that it was extremely isolated. There was no television;
                    there was no radio, except for certain times of the day, I guess, although I
                    don't remember listening to the radio. There was a very conscious attempt by the
                    administration of the school to keep outside influences out. Now you could go to
                    the library and sit around and read Time magazines from a year ago, if you
                    wished, but the idea of following the news day by day didn't happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This is such an important part of the pre-Foreign Service
                        experience, in a way. Were you doing a lot of catching up, or did you just
                        sort of start at a certain point and then keep up from then on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, I think I started at a certain point and then kept up from then on.
                    But there were, as your question brings out, huge gaps in my knowledge. As I
                    look back on that education, I think that whatever you do you benefit from, and
                    I benefited from the things that I studied. But I think that I paid a high price
                    in terms of the things that I was not able to study during those years, and that
                    that was kind of cost of doing business in the line that I was in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it from the fact that you were teaching in a

                        had left the seminary and all this did not put you on the wrong side of the

                <p>WRIGHT: Well, it did not initially, although over the next several years I did

                        a lot of stuff in the '60's leading up to that. I'm talking about the young
                        generation of the '60's, which you were a member of. Was that beginning to
                        get to you, too?</hi>

                <pb facs="0011" n="Page0011"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, there was a lot of ferment in those days. In fact, I can remember
                    coming back to Chicago for a visit right after the conventions of 1968 and
                    talking to people about it. And many of the ideas that were current at that
                    time, the anti-authoritarian ideas—were ones that I shared or vaguely shared.
                    But I would say that for most of the time that I was there... Oh, and by the
                    way, I've neglected to say that after I passed the Foreign Service exam I went
                    back to school because I was not able to go into the Foreign Service right away.
                    I went to the University of Chicago, and I was there for, I think, four
                    quarters, and I studied international relations there, after passing the Foreign
                    Service, but before going into the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When did you take the oral examination?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Let's see, I took the written exam at the end of 1966, and then I took
                    the oral exam about three or four months later.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Do you remember anything about the oral exam? The type of
                        questions?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Oh, yes, I certainly do.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I always like to capture this as much as possible. Would
                        you tell me your experiences?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, it was a very intimidating experience. There were, I believe, three
                    examiners. I don't remember their names now. This occurred in Chicago; I guess
                    it was at the Federal Building. It lasted about two hours, and the entire exam,
                    as I remember it, consisted of oneself sitting across the table from these three
                    examiners, and they asked you questions. None of them were questions that could
                    be answered yes or no, and none of them were questions that could be answered
                    with a definite solution. They were all open-ended questions. I remember one of
                    them that had to do with, I believe, Mark Twain. The examiner told me that I had
                    mentioned Mark Twain and told me to imagine that I was in front of a class and I
                    had been asked to talk about Mark Twain and about his place in literature, about
                    his effect on the Midwest, and several other aspects. And he said, “Well, just
                    imagine you're there. What would you say?” That's an example of the kind of
                    thing that you were asked. I remember another thing that I was asked was “Name
                    the five most serious economic problems in the United States today,” a question
                    that I did not answer very well, and I remember that when I was called back into
                    the room and told that I had passed the exam, one of the examiners said
                    something like, “Mr. Wright, you know you don't exactly shine in economics. That
                    perhaps is something you should focus on.”</p>

                        but you were not coming out of the political science courses at Harvard or
                        Princeton or something. Was there any emphasis or concern about how you'd do

                </p>

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I don't remember any references to that effect. I had the impression that
                    they took a look at me and asked me the same kind of things that they would have
                    asked anybody else.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: One thing, by the way, that I did not find in the exam were any sort of
                    trick questions or trick situations that they tried to put me in, which was one
                    of the things that everybody who took the exam during that period was warned
                    about. They would ask you to sit down, and there would be no chair, and so
                    on.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Or offered a cigarette and there was no ashtray. You know,
                        I heard all these things, and at one point I gave the oral exam, and we made
                        a great point of telling them that we weren't going to play these games.
                        What brought you to the Foreign Service? Was it seeing the sights of Rome,
                        because a lot of people go to Rome and stay there and don't join the Foreign
                        Service?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, the Foreign Service, I think, seemed to embody all the things that
                    I was interested in. I already liked languages. Even at Mundelein I studied
                    languages, three of them at a time. I like to travel. I was fascinated with
                    foreign countries. I had the vague idea in my mind that diplomacy was a world of
                    glamour and interest and, possibly, minor intrigue, and all that was appealing.
                    And so from what I knew of the Foreign Service, all that I knew of the Foreign
                    Service I liked, and there was no other competing attraction in my ken at that
                    time. Now what I would have done had I not passed the Foreign Service exam is a
                    good question. I don't know.</p>

                <p>WRIGHT: I came in right at the beginning of 1968.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you characterize the people you came in with in that

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: They were a varied lot, I would say, which puts me in mind of an
                    observation that I've often made, which is that despite the fact that the
                    Foreign Service exam is very difficult and weeds out a lot of very good people,
                    it also appears to admit a certain number of people who are not really suited to
                    the Foreign Service and, in fact, don't stay very long. And I think that was
                    true of the people I was with. On the other hand, we also had a number of people
                    who have had outstanding careers and become ambassadors, and some of them are
                    still in the Foreign Service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you took the A100 course, about the spring of '68, I
                        guess, you were ready to go out. Did you know where you wanted to go, or did
                        you have any thoughts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, I had one thought: I did not want to go to Vietnam. And it was a
                    very common thought at the time, one shared by most of my classmates.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation, as far as the Foreign Service was
                        concerned, with Vietnam in the spring of '68? Let's see, the Tet Offensive
                        had just taken place, and we were talking about sort of getting the hell
                        out.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: The Tet Offensive had just taken place, and I'm trying to think whether I
                    was assigned to Vietnam before or during or just after the Tet Offensive.
                    Anyway, it was one of the things that put the fear of God into all of us. You
                    were back here studying either with the prospect of going to Vietnam or just
                    having been assigned to Vietnam. I suppose the Tet Offensive occurred in
                    February and then there was, I believe, a “mini”-Tet Offensive in May, and
                    probably it was during the interim that I was assigned to Vietnam. But I can
                    assure you that I did not want to go to Vietnam, partially because I was scared
                    and didn't want to get killed, and partially because I thought that what we were
                    doing was wrong. And I suspect that most of the people in my class felt pretty
                    much the same way.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the policy towards Vietnam at that time by the
                        Foreign Service personnel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, we were in the process of sending large numbers of Foreign Service
                    officers to Vietnam, many of them on their first tour. I often tell junior
                    officers today who find themselves in consular sections, to their great dislike,
                    that when I came into the Foreign Service our equivalent of the consular section
                    was to be sent to Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you were assigned that, what process did you go
                        through? Did you take the language?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes. First of all, most of us did go to Vietnam. We were assigned to
                    Vietnam. I think, by and large, the people who did not have to go to Vietnam
                    were women, although one or two of them volunteered to go to Vietnam and did go,
                    and people with some kind of an advanced degree, and it was thought that this
                    qualified them to do something more elevated and meaningful, so they didn't have
                    to go to Vietnam either. Then again, I don't know what the figures are, but I
                    believe that over half of us in our class were sent to Vietnam.</p>

                <p>WRIGHT: Ten months.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did that include area studies and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, it included area studies, and these, or at least some aspects of
                    them, by the way, were often resisted by the people who were in the courses
                    because they were of real uneven quality. We had people who were real scholars
                    in the language and the country who would come and talk to us, and then we had a
                    lot of other people who were looked upon as mouthpieces for the administration,
                    who didn't seem to know a lot about Vietnam but were cheerleaders to urge us
                    along to go over there and do our part.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you a combined group at that time. I mean, were there
                        people from AID and USIA, military?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, that's right. Now I'm trying to picture in my mind my classes.
                    Anyway, the short answer is yes. I was going to say that there were not many
                    military, but that's not right. There were a lot of military officers who
                    studied Vietnamese with us.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I did all right. I think I had a 3/3 at the end, although when I got
                    there I did not learn to speak Vietnamese as well as a lot of the people I had
                    gone to school with, because they were sent out to the field to live in
                    provinces or districts, whereas I went to the embassy political section as a
                    so-called provincial reporter, so I had less opportunity to practice than they
                    did. But anyway, I got to the point where I could do my job with my language,
                    but a number of these people who really lived night and day with the Vietnamese
                    became superb at it.</p>

                <p>WRIGHT: Spring of '69. I went there in March of '69.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And you were there until when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I was there until September of '70, the first time.</p>

                        out in the first part of '69, what were your jobs?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I was attached to the political section of the embassy, and in that very
                    large section, there was a sub-unit called the provincial reporting unit, and it
                    was headed by a Foreign Service officer by the name of Nick Ford, who was later
                    succeeded by Cal Maylert, and it was divided up according to the different corps
                    in Vietnam. There were four corps. And there were two provincial reporting
                    officers for each corps. I was assigned to Fourth Corps, which is the Mekong
                    Delta, a fellow by the name of Dick Harrington and I. We were the two provincial
                    reporters. We spent about half our time in Saigon and about half our time down
                    in the Delta. We were both living in Can Tho, which was the Fourth Corps
                    headquarters, the unofficial capital of the Delta, and our job was to go around
                    the Delta, to its 16 provinces, and report on what we saw happening. We had a
                    very vague mandate. We were sometimes given specific assignments by the head of
                    our unit in Saigon, but often we weren't. Often we went to a place, and we
                    looked around and tried to divine what was going on that would be of interest to
                    the embassy and report it. We were quite free in what we were able to do. It was
                    a marvelous job, marvelous.</p>

                <pb facs="0016" n="Page0016"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: At that time, the last American troops were leaving the Delta, that is,
                    the last American ground troops, in the Ninth Division. The Ninth Division,
                    which was based in My Tho, was packing up and leaving. And from that point
                    forward, which is something that a lot of people don't realize, that is, from
                    1969, so for the last five and a half or so years of the war, there were no
                    American ground troops in Fourth Corps. There was American air support, but by
                    and large, the Vietnamese were fighting in the Delta in large part on their
                    own.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I'm trying to think who the corps commander was then. I don't remember
                    who was there then; however, the head of the Vietnamese Ninth Division then was
                    a general by the name of General Di. I'll think of his full name in a second. He
                    was regarded as a very good man—honest, hardworking. I can remember that during
                    this period his picture appeared on the cover of the New York Times Magazine, a
                    big cover story about him, but he was, I thought, and still do think, an example
                    of a good officer, competent at what he was doing, with a sense of dedication,
                    hard work and under terribly difficult conditions. General Di, by the way, now
                    lives in Orlando, Florida. I spoke to him about a year ago on the telephone. He
                    had just gotten out of Vietnam not very long before. He told me that he was
                    among the last five or so South Vietnamese officers who were released by the
                    Communists from prison. He spent something like 18 years in prison after the
                    end.</p>
                <p>But let me go back to your question. I think there were a number of officers,
                    like General Di, who were extremely good men, operating under very adverse
                    conditions, who were admirable. There were also, of course, a lot of the other
                    kind; and there was a system of cronyism, and worse, in which all of these
                    people had to operate. And I think it has to be said that, although there are
                    many reasons why we lost the war, some of them our fault, had there been a
                    greater level of dedication on the part of people in command in Vietnam,
                    including a number of military officers, things also might have turned out
                    differently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the lower level, of the
                        province level, of the Vietnamese leadership there, and also the village

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: It was mixed. You had examples of good, competent province chiefs with
                    leadership qualities, and you had examples of the other kind, I'm afraid. And
                    the fortunes of a province were determined in very large measure by the kind of
                    leadership that it had. So I don't think it's saying anything very profound. It
                    goes without saying that when you have good leadership in a province or in a
                    military unit you have good results.</p>

                        and advisors and all this? I mean the American side.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: It seems to me a number of our programs were successful. The Rural
                    Development Banks, for example, introducing new strains of rice, road
                    building—these were efforts which really introduced, even during the war, a new
                    level of prosperity into the Delta. And in fact, don't forget that, I would say,
                    from 1969 to 1973, things in the Delta, and I think in the rest of the country
                    as well—although I'm less acquainted with that—were going awfully well. The
                    theory is that in 1968 in the Delta we were regarded as extremely dangerous.
                    We're not so regarded during this '69-'73 period. A great deal was done to lift
                    standards of living, and a great deal was done to clean areas of Viet Cong
                    elements and to make life a lot more livable for people. It was not until, say,
                    the spring of 1974, maybe a bit earlier, that things really started to
                    deteriorate and move, kind of, inexorably toward the end, the fall of
                    Saigon.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Oh, yes, quite a bit. I can remember going to the military briefings
                    every morning for different periods at IV Corps headquarters. These were in the
                    form of a briefing to the commanding general, and I would say that on the big
                    map, on an average morning, there would have been recorded maybe a hundred
                    incidents. In some of them maybe no one would have been killed, or one person
                    killed, and in the bigger ones maybe a hundred or two hundred people would have
                    been killed. So there was a great deal of military activity going on, but these
                    were not dramatic pitched battles, like you saw farther north in Khe Sanh and
                    elsewhere. These were skirmishes between units or parts of units, but they were
                    occurring every day of the year, just about.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I haven't thought about that particular question for a long time. I
                    remember one effect it had was that there was a lot of looting done in Cambodia,
                    and units were returning to South Vietnam loaded with stuff. I haven't thought
                    about this for a long time, but I remember it was of such proportions that I can
                    remember John Paul Vann being very unhappy about what was going on and speaking
                    to the commanding general about it.</p>

                        in any other country in the world ever. Was there a division between the
                        young officers seeing it one way and older officers seeing it another, or
                        any conflicts?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Oh, sure. Yes, on the subject of corruption, which is usually what
                    divides people in these kinds of situations, it certainly did then. There was
                    great tendency on the part of older officers to take what they regarded as the
                    longer, more culturally sensitive view, and to regard corruption as a perhaps
                    unfortunate fact but nothing we should get overly worked up about, as opposed to
                    the view of most of the younger people, including me, which was that corruption
                    was something that got in the way of the war effort and that we ought to be more
                    active in trying to suppress.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have a feeling that your reports that were coming
                        in were being suppressed, doctored or what-have-you, as far as how it went
                        up the chain of command and to Washington?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: It's a little bit hard to compare the two periods because in that first
                    period we did not have consulates out in the field, so they were not doing any
                    of the kind of reporting that they did later. But during the '69-'70
                    period—Ambassador Bunker was there—I would say that in both periods that I was
                    there, '69-'70 and then '73 until the end, there was pretty heavy massaging of
                    the reports that came out of the younger officers. I don't necessarily find
                    total fault with that. I think in such a sensitive and complicated situation, it
                    behooved the embassy to look carefully at what went out and not simply say,
                    “Every man for himself. You can all report whatever it is you think you see
                    happening.” That, especially when you state it that way, would be an absurd
                    position for an ambassador to take. But I think that in the doing of this, the
                    bias of the older officers was in the direction which I have described, so some
                    of what was being sent out of the embassy reflected this and was probably—when
                    things like corruption were being discussed—not etched as finely as they might
                    have been otherwise. At the same time, I would certainly not think that this, in
                    itself, had any particular effect on the way Washington saw the war or the
                    actions that we took. In fact, I think that the more you read about the history
                    of the war, the more it's clear that the President and others high up in the
                    succeeding Administrations had a very good idea of what was going on in Vietnam,
                    warts and all. When they took particular decisions which might seem to ignore
                    those facts, they took them for very different reasons. And so the more I read,
                    the more it's clear to me that there was no dearth of knowledge about what was
                    going in Vietnam in the top echelons of our government.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you see a difference—here we're talking about the
                        '69-'70 period—between what the American military was reporting and what the
                        provincial reporters and others were reporting?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0019" n="Page0019"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, we reported in vastly different ways. First of all, most military
                    reports are incomprehensible to the rest of us. They are often reports which fit
                    into a format, so it's the format itself which determines what's going to come
                    through in the report. There is little prose reporting, I think its fair to say,
                    and usually the prose is so horrendous that it can't be read anyway. I don't
                    mean to be overly critical of military reporting, but I think that military
                    reporting generally would not be set up to catch the kinds of things that we are
                    talking about. It's not set up to report on corruption, and so on. Now again,
                    that doesn't mean that military commanders sitting back in the Pentagon were
                    ignorant of what was going on in Vietnam. I think there was so much that went on
                    by word of mouth and in other ways that I doubt that most of the people sitting
                    back here were ill informed—although I must say that when you read about people
                    like General Westmoreland, I think that probably there there were some
                    misconceptions, maybe some big ones, about the way the war was going.</p>
                <p>You know, Bill Colby had, I thought, a very good article in the Washington Post
                    some months before his death, in which he said, among other things, that most of
                    the histories written of the Vietnam War pretty much stopped at Tet '68,
                    ignoring what went on later. His view was that, yes, we made terrible mistakes
                    up until that point, but after it we corrected a number of them. And so that
                    kind of reporting is like reporting the Second World War but stopping in 1943 or
                    so. And so his view was that we had corrected a lot of the things that were
                    wrong and that we, in our lives, were doing extremely well during much of that
                    latter period, until we petered out and greatly slowed down our assistance.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find there was much reliance on what the CIA was
                        doing, or was the CIA sort of doing its thing and the political section was
                        doing its thing and the two didn't meet particularly?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: My sense is that we were both doing our thing. I guess they met up in the
                    Ambassador's office, because he read both of them. There was so much reporting
                    coming out of both sides. One of the features of the CIA reporting in those days
                    was that the CIA station chief did periodically, maybe every month or six weeks
                    or two months, his own assessment of the situation. And these were extremely
                    well written, not always accurate, but extremely well written pieces which were
                    fairly comprehensive in their picture of the situation, and there are things
                    that I have not seen since written by the CIA station. And I suspect that when
                    these well written pieces, seemingly comprehensive pieces, went back to
                    Washington, they were regarded with some seriousness.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You know, something I've heard a lot about are young
                        officers like yourself, trained in Vietnamese, getting out in the provinces.
                        Did the CIA have the same system of training people in Vietnamese, or were
                        they more reliant on other sources?</hi>

                <pb facs="0020" n="Page0020"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: They trained some people in Vietnamese, but by and large, their people
                    who were out in the provinces did not speak Vietnamese. These often tended to be
                    people who were, say, former police officers—people who were brought in from
                    outside to fill those positions. And they were not necessarily people who knew
                    much about Vietnam, although some of them eventually stayed there a long time
                    and could have been said to have a lot of experience in Vietnam. But I would say
                    that, over all, their people did not tend to speak Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I would assume in that situation it would have been a real
                        detriment. I mean they would have been more dependent on—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, it tied them very closely to the Vietnamese who worked for them.
                    They tended to have one of the things that the CIA did there, I think in pretty
                    much every province during the height of their involvement, their own separate
                    quarters, their own house, their own everything. It pretty much made a shambles
                    of any attempt to pretend they were integrated into the rest of the
                    establishment. And to make matters worse, they habitually referred to their
                    quarters as the embassy. And this was standard—all over the Delta, certainly,
                    and I'm sure all over the country—that if a stranger, Vietnamese or otherwise,
                    came around looking for the embassy house, he would be pointed to the CIA house,
                    which was unfortunate. But there was either little care, or perhaps it was
                    inadvertence or incompetence, but little was done to create a situation where
                    the CIA would be hard to find or would be integrated into the rest of the
                    group.</p>

                        in this period, '69-'70, that the CIA had their own guards, Nung guards, who
                        looked different from others. So as soon as you'd go outside and you'd see a
                        house, and here would be a Nung, a fairly big guy who doesn't look
                        Vietnamese at all but Oriental, and you say, “Well, it has to be a CIA
                        house.”</hi>

                <pb facs="0021" n="Page0021"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: I can remember when I was acting consul general, after 1973, in the
                    Delta, at a certain point, the CIA told us it was sending someone down and that
                    this person was to be unknown as a CIA operative but was to be integrated into
                    the political section. And so I did my best to keep up my part of the bargain,
                    and we prepared as best we could. We prepared an office for the person and
                    everything, and it turned out when he arrived that the CIA station chief, first
                    of all, decided he would go out personally to meet the man at the airport, which
                    was a bit of a give-away. Many of the CIA people lived in a certain part, in
                    front of the CORDs Club, and they all drove distinctive types of cars and they
                    all had their names on their parking places in front of these little town houses
                    that they occupied. I came to find out after the guy had arrived that they had
                    painted his name right into one of these parking spots, right in front of where
                    all of the CIA people lived. With that kind of attention to detail, going in the
                    wrong direction, it's an example of what I think, by the way, is a fairly common
                    phenomenon around the world, but which was really accentuated there. The agency
                    often takes extremely inadequate steps to hide the identity of its people.</p>

                    going to end any time soon. That turned out to be correct, I guess. But I don't
                    know that I had any profound thoughts on the subject. I will say something else,
                    though. I'd forgotten to tell you, during the 1969 to '70 period, that I really
                    had two jobs. One of my jobs was, as I have described to you, one of the people
                    in the provincial reporting unit. My other job, however, in Can Tho, was to be
                    the Pol-Ad, or political advisor, to John Paul Vann.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, my goodness.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: And so, when I left Vietnam, in the fall of 1970, in retrospect, I
                    believe I made a bad mistake, because I had gotten to know Vann pretty well by
                    then. Vann asked me to stay and keep working for him. In retrospect, I wish I
                    had.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: John Paul Vann was quite a character in the Vietnam
                        situation. Could you tell me how you worked with him and your impression of
                        what he was doing, again, sticking to the '69-'70 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0022" n="Page0022"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, first of all I wrote an article about this shortly before Vann's
                    death for the Foreign Service Journal, if you're ever interested in it, in the
                    Spring of 1973. I admired Vann greatly. Vann was a unique personality, unique
                    abilities. I've not met his equal since then. He was even at the time I arrived
                    somewhat larger than life, so I didn't know what to expect. And I would say
                    during the first six months or so that I was there, Vann paid very little
                    attention to me. He had not gotten along very well with my predecessor—no
                    disrespect to my predecessor—for whatever reason. Vann had possibly regarded him
                    as working for the embassy and not for him, Vann. But at any rate, I got to know
                    Vann slowly, a little bit better as time wore on, and after a while, I would
                    take trips with Vann and we would go places. And I got to know Vann, I think,
                    for a newcomer, pretty well. Vann had his coterie of old friends, Colonel Carl
                    Bernard, for example, others, that had been with him in Vietnam for a long time,
                    and those were Colonel Wilbur Wilson, others. I can tell you many stories about
                    Vann, many of them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Say what you'd like. It might give a little of the flavor,
                        particularly when you were with him.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Vann was a man who was tremendously ambitious, first of all. He had ideas
                    about where he wanted to go. One of the things which Vann wanted very much to do
                    was be senior advisor in a corps. Now there never were any senior advisors
                    except military advisors, generals. When Vann arrived in IV Corps, he was the
                    deputy for CORDs. He wanted to be number one. There was a deputy for CORDs, then
                    there was a brigadier general, who was the deputy for the military side. And on
                    top of that there was a two or three star general. Although that was a very big
                    assignment—Vann had probably a couple of thousand Americans under him and who
                    knows how many Vietnamese, so it was a big job—Vann was always looking for
                    bigger jobs. And he was a great bureaucratic infighter. I can remember, at one
                    point, the commanding general was going away on vacation, so there was a
                    question of who would replace him, who would be the acting Corps senior advisor.
                    And Vann got word, either formally or informally before the fact, that they were
                    going to name the brigadier general acting senior advisor, even though he had
                    been there a shorter time than Vann had. So Vann had, in his mind, seniority. I
                    remember him saying to me, “You know, this is unacceptable. I should be the
                    acting senior advisor, and if they won't make me acting senior advisor, it'll be
                    all the more difficult some day to have that job.” So Vann really made a big
                    stink about it. He sent a letter—I forget whether it was to Saigon or to the
                    commanding general—saying that if he were not made acting in the general's
                    absence, he was quitting, and he said, “They'll have to do it. They'll have to
                    give it to me because I'm too well known. They can't afford to have me resign,
                    so I know if I take this stand it'll piss everybody off. They'll all be mad at
                    me, but they'll do it.” Which is what happened.</p>
                <pb facs="0023" n="Page0023"/>
                <p>Vann was a man who took big risks with his life, with his career, everything, but
                    they were well calibrated risks. He did not go off and do things mindlessly,
                    although he did do things very dangerously. One time, I remember, I drove with
                    Vann and a congressman, whose name I don't remember, down to Camau from Can Tho,
                    the southernmost province town in the Delta, maybe a hundred miles or so. This
                    had to be sometime in 1970. And this congressman was making a trip out there,
                    like many of his colleagues had—he was by himself—and Vann said, “Okay,
                    Congressman, we're going to drive to the Delta.” And he made a point of
                    dramatizing this. He said, “No U.S. Congressman has ever made this trip before.”
                    And while we were in the car, he said, “By the way, Congressman, my superiors
                    don't know that I'm doing this, because if they did they would have stopped me.”
                    Anyway, we drove all the way down there, and I can remember, as we approached
                    the province town, we ran smack into a military convoy of, I don't know, 10 or
                    20 trucks—big, huge military trucks—and we were on one of these small dirt
                    roads, and there's not enough room for a truck and another car to pass, at least
                    not safely, not the way these guys were driving. Well, these guys were used to
                    driving any way they wanted, and when a South Vietnamese military convoy got on
                    one of these roads, they simply expected everybody else to get off. They drove
                    right down the center of the road, and everybody else was supposed to get off.
                    So we approached the convoy, and the convoy starts whizzing past us, and all of
                    them trying to wave us off the road. Vann was driving. We had a driver with us,
                    but Vann, when he was outside of the city, always insisted on driving himself,
                    didn't trust his drivers, didn't trust him to make the right moves if there were
                    danger. So Vann was driving. This really irritated Vann, and after several of
                    these trucks had whizzed by us, all of them motioning to us to get off the road,
                    Vann brought his car to a halt right in the center of the road so that the next
                    guy couldn't' get by, and he sat there, and he said, “Lacy, go tell that guy in
                    that lead truck who I am, and tell him that as soon as I get to Camau I'm going
                    to speak to his commanding general.” So that was my assignment. I forget what I
                    said, but at any rate, that was the kind of thing. Vann was supremely
                    self-confident.</p>
                <p>I'll tell you another thing that happened along the same road at a different
                    time. We were driving along, out in the middle of nowhere, out in the middle of
                    the rice paddies, and we passed a little shack on the side of the road. Vann
                    stopped the car—he was driving, just he and I—and he said, “Lacy, would you mind
                    going in that hut there and asking if they have my glasses?” He said, “When I
                    was coming by here about six months ago, I was driving my mo—" [end of tape]</p>
                <pb facs="0024" n="Page0024"/>
                <p>He told me to go to the shack, ask for his glasses, and then he told me he had
                    been there about six months before, riding his motorcycle, all by himself, and
                    he had come upon another South Vietnamese convoy, and he had gotten off the road
                    for the convoy to pass. He had noticed that there were Viet Cong nearby and they
                    were laying an ambush, and he looked up and he saw a South Vietnamese convoy
                    approaching, so he knew what the ambush was for. So he got off his motorcycle.
                    He waved frantically at the oncoming convoy to warn them of this danger, but to
                    no avail. They rushed right by him. As I recall this, I don't believe then there
                    was an ambush, or at least they got by. The problem was that once they were by
                    it, John Paul Vann was there on the road looking across at all these guys who
                    had been about to lay the ambush. So, he said, he fled on foot across the rice
                    fields, and he ran into this house trying to hide. And the people were scared,
                    petrified, and asked him to leave. And it was then that he got out of the rice
                    paddy, ran the other direction, finally came upon a South Vietnamese outpost,
                    told them what had happened, radioed in and was able to get out of the area. But
                    at any rate, he told me that he thought that when he was in that house he had
                    left his glasses there, so he asked me to go in and look for them. And I did,
                    and I went in and I asked if they had John Paul Vann's glasses, and they said,
                    no, they did not, and I left.</p>
                <p>Vann was a man who—this was one side of him—took chances. He did this, he said,
                    in order really to find out what was going on. For example, once a week, John
                    Vann, the deputy for CORDs, would go out and spend the night at a lonely outpost
                    somewhere in the Delta—once a week, all night. Vann, by the way, got very little
                    sleep. He told me he routinely slept four hours a night. So he would do that.
                    And by virtue of doing this, by virtue of every day being all over the Delta,
                    once a week staying the night with a bunch of 17-year-old soldiers out in the
                    middle of nowhere, he knew the Delta like the back of his hand. He knew all the
                    units; he knew who was sleeping with whose wife among the Vietnamese military;
                    he knew everything. And certainly, some of that could not have occurred if he
                    had not done these kinds of things, some of which were dangerous.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the impression of Vann? We're still talking about
                        the '69-'70 period. You were with him from time to time. You'd come back and
                        how was he seen at the embassy, by the political section and others who'd
                        come up to you, “What are you doing with that wild man?” What was
                        their—</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0025" n="Page0025"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, there was some of that, yes. I would say the higher up you went in
                    the hierarchy, the more distrust there was of Vann, although there was a lot of,
                    I think, grudging admiration for Vann as well. The person who distrusted him
                    most, apparently, was Ambassador Bunker. Vann told me that Bunker almost threw
                    him out of the country at one point. Vann had become friendly with a man named
                    Tung Ngoc Chiao, and Tung Ngoc Chiao was, or later became, a Lower House deputy.
                    He was from the Delta. His brother was a well known Viet Cong officer, and the
                    authorities were going to arrest Chiao for having fraternized—if you'll forgive
                    the expression—with his brother, been in contact with him. Vann thought that
                    this was totally unjust and that he was being made the scapegoat for other
                    reasons. At any rate, he and Tung Ngoc Chiao were longtime friends, and Vann was
                    not going to see this happen, and so Vann hid Tung Ngoc Chiao from the
                    authorities. And it was this that Ambassador Bunker found intolerable, and told
                    him the next time he pulled a stunt like this he was going to throw him out of
                    the country.</p>
                <p>I can remember another incident involving Ambassador Bunker, in which Vann,
                    either in writing or orally, made the allegation that X per cent of all of the
                    Vietnamese soldiers in the Delta were “ghost” soldiers—that is, didn't really
                    exist, were names on a list.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you'd be drawing rations which would go to the
                        commander.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: To the commander, exactly. And this was challenged by Ambassador Bunker,
                    who said, “This doesn't sound right to me, and by the way, how do you know?” And
                    so Vann wrote a paper on this subject, which I saw—I don't know what has ever
                    happened to it. Vann, by the way, kept huge meticulous files. But Vann wrote a
                    paper on this, which I can remember reading, in which he went, in a very
                    detailed way, with dates, places, names, down a long list of places which he
                    himself had verified, where he himself had spent the night, and where he said,
                    “Okay, you say you've got a hundred soldiers here. Could you please call them
                    all together so we can see them?” And maybe 50 would show up, and he'd say, “On
                    the night of December 12, 1969, I was in X village, and these were the results.”
                    And he had, I don't know, 10 or 15 or 20 of these, and he said, “This is why I
                    made the statement that I did.”</p>
                <p>So Vann was able, in a tremendously detailed way, to back up the kinds of things
                    that he said. And he told me that often, instead of saying something which
                    appeared extreme, he would, for dramatic effect and to make his point even more
                    strongly, he would top somebody. Somebody, a congressman, would come out there
                    and say, “This is really terrible. I understand that 12 per cent of these
                    soldiers aren't even here.” Now you can imagine what a normal Foreign Service
                    officer's reaction to that would be: “Hmph, well...” Vann's reaction would
                    always be, “Well, you don't know the half of it. It's much worse than that.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, as a political advisor, it sounds like you didn't
                        have much of a chance to do any political advising.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0026" n="Page0026"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Vann didn't need much political advice, but at the same time, Vann was
                    willing to listen to people, by the way. And I think that that's not an aspect
                    that I've brought up yet or maybe that you associate with Vann. I remember there
                    was a fellow who was, I guess, with IVS, International Volunteer Services, and
                    these tended to be, sometimes, kind of hippie types, free spirits who were in
                    Vietnam and often doing good things, teaching English or other kinds of work
                    like that, but they tended to be free spirits. Sometimes they were on marijuana;
                    sometimes they were doing other things. And word reached me of such a fellow who
                    was, I believe, in Chao Duc province, and our military were really down on this
                    guy. They wanted Vann to throw him out. They thought he was a bad influence.
                    Maybe they suspected he was in touch with the Viet Cong. I don't know. But
                    anyway, they didn't like him, and they wanted him out, and they wanted Vann to
                    throw him out. And he was the kind of guy you might think Vann would throw out.
                    But Vann went and talked to this guy, and he came back, and he said, “Well, he's
                    not such a bad guy. He's a little odd. He does this; he does that, but he knows
                    a lot of things. He knows a lot about the local situation.” So that's an
                    example. Vann was not a knee-jerk kind of guy, who did things just because he
                    had a guiding principle which says, “In this situation you do that.” Vann went
                    and saw for himself.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did he get along with the military. He had been
                        a military officer and left, but sort of doing things on his own, I would
                        have thought that this would have not worked to well.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I think they were divided about Vann. I think, on the one hand, they
                    admired Vann for his military skills. Vann used to say, by the way, at that
                    time, when he was about 46, that he had more combat experience than anybody in
                    the US Army. And that, his bravery, his willingness to take risks—all of these
                    were attractive qualities to military people. On the other hand, of course, they
                    were a little nervous around him because they didn't know what he might do next.
                    So there was some of that nervousness. But Vann also went out of his way to stay
                    in touch with some of the higher-ups in the army, and so he had friends in high
                    places in the military who appreciated him and who knew how good he was.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, from your experience, did his alleged womanizing get
                        in the way of anything or was that a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, he only slept four hours a night, don't forget, and he needed all
                    that time. No, Vann was a womanizer, no doubt about it, and I presume that the
                    effect on his family was probably very bad, probably severe, and I wouldn't seek
                    to try to defend that.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You say you left there in 1970 for the first time. I

                <p>WRIGHT: Okay.Q: In September 1970 you'd left Vietnam, and we'll pick it up next
                    time where you go after that.</p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Okay. Thank you.</p>
                <p>[Pause]</p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Again on John Paul Vann. Vann had a big effect on the way that the war
                    was fought, and that does not, I believe, come through in any of the things that
                    I've said up until now. Vann was the origin or one of the origins of the whole
                    concept of Vietnamization, that is, the view that we should not be fighting the
                    war for the Vietnamese, the Vietnamese should be fighting the war for
                    themselves. I can remember, a number of times when visitors would come to Can
                    Tho, Vann would inform them that up until 1968, even though we were drafting our
                    young men into the military, South Vietnam, he said, was not drafting its young
                    men into the military. That changed at Tet '68. But Vann pushed this idea until
                    eventually it became US policy and we did engage in a whole process of
                    Vietnamization. Another thing that Vann did, on a smaller but very significant
                    scale, was to have gotten the rules of engagement for helicopter gunships and
                    bombings changed in the Mekong Delta and elsewhere so that the lives of innocent
                    people were better protected. This is one of the sadder parts of our involvement
                    in Vietnam, that so many innocent people were killed. Vann saw this as a
                    terrible problem, one that was inhumane in itself and one that was also
                    preventing our side from winning the war by alienating so many of Vietnam's
                    civilians. And he went through a lot of trouble to try to get the rules of
                    engagement changed so that this happened less often. And he was successful in
                    doing some of that.</p>
                <p>So Vann had a big effect on the war and how it was fought. And by the way, we
                    haven't even mentioned the fact that in the 1972 Easter Offensive people like
                    Robert Thompson, the famous British guerilla war expert, credit Vann personally
                    with having saved Vietnam from the Communists in that offensive. He believed,
                    and many others do, too, that had Vann not taken over the military activities in
                    Two Corps during that period, Vietnam would have fallen then.</p>

                    wish now that I had stayed in Vietnam, which John Vann asked me to do. But I
                    didn't. I went to London, and I was first aide to the Ambassador, and then I was
                    in the commercial section, and then I went back to the United States, was in the
                    economics course—</p>

                        Ambassador when you got there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Walter Annenberg.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about Ambassador Annenberg a bit. When he
                        first arrived he was rather controversial, but by the time you got there I
                        guess he was—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, by the time I got there he was still controversial. I would say by
                    the time he left, which must have been in '73 or '74, he was much less so and, I
                    believe, fairly well liked. But from the time that he arrived, for two or three
                    years, he was badly criticized by the British press, often unfairly, I think. It
                    seemed he could do nothing right. But he got off to a bad start in London by
                    chance, having appeared on a television show with the Queen, which had nothing
                    to do with him but which had to do with the Queen receiving the credentials of
                    an ambassador, and he happened to be up next. And so his presentation of his
                    credentials to the Queen was filmed, and in it he made some remarks which, when
                    they appeared on television, appeared stilted and, indeed, strange to the
                    British public, and he was criticized for it.</p>
                <pb facs="0029" n="Page0029"/>
                <p>Annenberg had some challenges to overcome when he went to London. First, he was,
                    of course, the appointee of President Nixon, who was not very popular there,
                    partially because we were in the middle of the Vietnam War. Secondly, his own
                    past lent itself to a certain amount of criticism, his father having been
                    sometimes on the other side of the law, and the British popular press didn't
                    hesitate to remind readers of this from time to time. It was embarrassing.
                    Third, a very critical book had come out about Annenberg about this time, which
                    was widely disseminated and read. Fourth, Annenberg had a physical defect, in
                    the sense that he stuttered. And this apparently was a lifelong affliction, and
                    he had to go to certain lengths to try to overcome it. And one of the things
                    that he did was to speak in very clipped and precise tones, syllable by
                    syllable, which appeared stilted and strange when it was heard. And this was one
                    of the things that was taken as an object of ridicule in the television piece
                    that I referred to before.</p>
                <p>Within the embassy? Annenberg was, of course a very wealthy man, in the tradition
                    of people that go to places like London and Paris and Rome, and this in itself
                    set him apart from everybody else there. But he was not a nasty man, by any
                    means, and I think that he tried hard in the situation there to be liked in the
                    embassy and, of course, do a good job. His style of management was—let me see
                    how to put this... Let me not talk about his style, but let me talk about the
                    situation that he found there. When he first arrived, he had a DCM in the person
                    of Philip Kaiser, who was a political appointee DCM, the only one that I have
                    ever known in my entire career in the Foreign Service, a Democrat, of course,
                    from the previous administration. And naturally, the first thing that Annenberg
                    did when he arrived was to fire Phil Kaiser, which seems to me the most normal
                    thing in the world. Phil Kaiser apparently took umbrage at this, and one of the
                    things that he did was not to leave London. He stayed there and got a job, and
                    this was a source of a certain amount—at least from my bird's-eye view—of
                    tension between Annenberg and him, which continued. I don't think he played a
                    big role; I think it was a bit of an irritant, though, to have a situation that
                    went on like that.</p>
                <pb facs="0030" n="Page0030"/>
                <p>He was replaced by a man named Tom Hughes, who, I believe, left for personal
                    reasons not very long after, a fairly short tenure. When I arrived, the DCM was
                    a man named Jerry Green, a very fine career Foreign Service officer, an
                    all-star—that's why he was in London—very nice man, as well. And I was his aide
                    as well as aide to the Ambassador for a certain time. Jerry Green and the
                    Ambassador eventually fell out, which was very unfortunate, I think. It was
                    unfortunate for the career of Jerry Green, who only had one or two more
                    assignments and then left the Service and did not become an ambassador, although
                    he was certainly very much headed in that direction. But Jerry Green was caught
                    in a strange situation. He was the DCM, and a strong one, but he found himself
                    between a political ambassador, who was uncertain of his own role, I believe,
                    and did not know how the Foreign Service worked (no reason why he should), on
                    the one hand, and on the other hand, a group of heads of section, counselors,
                    most of whom were prima donnas and all of whom wanted direct access to the
                    Ambassador. In the middle of this sandwich was Jerry Green. And eventually, I
                    guess after several situations which were not totally pleasing to the
                    Ambassador, one arose in which Jerry Green made a decision, because he thought
                    he needed to. It was something that must have been time-sensitive; I don't
                    remember what it was. But he made the decision, as I remember it, and then told
                    the Ambassador later, and the Ambassador felt this was something that he should
                    have been in on from the beginning—a common kind of contretemps in the Foreign
                    Service, but this one coming on top of other things probably assumed bigger
                    proportions than it might have otherwise. And Jerry Green, knowing that he had
                    displeased the Ambassador, took the initiative and asked to be reassigned and
                    was. So I haven't explained much yet, I think, about Annenberg's management
                    style, but I believe it's more correct to put it in terms of a situation which
                    developed there and which was not entirely felicitous.</p>
                <p>After I left, I understand, things settled down there, and Annenberg, in fact,
                    became fairly well liked by the British. And that was, I think, an achievement
                    on his part, since before that, as I said, almost every thing he did was
                    criticized. He gave, I remember, a painting to Chequers, you know, one of the
                    residences of the prime minister, and he was criticized for that in an editorial
                    in the Times, with words to the effect of “Who does this guy think he is, giving
                    us a painting?” So almost nothing he did seemed to turn out right. But as I say,
                    in the end, I think when he left much of that situation had been redressed.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the '70-'72 period, Vietnam was still very much in
                        everybody's mind. Did you find yourself being sort of the resident advisor
                        on what's happening in Vietnam and all, I mean, people coming to you,
                        including the Ambassador, and saying, “Tell me about Vietnam”?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0031" n="Page0031"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: There was some of that, although one of the things that happened when I
                    was there was that John Vann came and visited. Before I had left Vietnam, Vann
                    and I talked, and he knew I was coming to London, so taking the initiative as
                    usual, said, “Look, when you get there, why don't you have the embassy ask that
                    I come there and brief them about Vietnam, because I'm going to be in the US and
                    I could come back through there and I could brief the embassy?” So that, in
                    fact, is what I did. I made this suggestion. Vann was—I wouldn't say he was a
                    household word by any means—but he was known among people in our service who
                    followed this, so I was able to persuade the Ambassador and one of his
                    political-appointee aides that this would be a good idea, and so it was done.
                    And Vann came to London. He had gone back to the United States and gotten sick,
                    and I don't know what it was, whether it was hepatitis or what, but it laid him
                    low for several weeks, so he was some weeks late in getting back to Vietnam. But
                    he did come through London. He stayed with me in my apartment, and he spoke to
                    the country team, including the Ambassador, as I remember, and he was received
                    with a lot of interest because we were at the height of the war and at the
                    height of the criticism of the war, ad the British, particularly the press—not
                    totally, but certainly the left side of the spectrum—was very critical of our
                    involvement there. We also had a number of demonstrations in front of the
                    embassy, which became a favorite haunt of people who were against the war.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I'm sure this was the time a little earlier that the now
                        President of the United States, William Clinton, demonstrated. Do you know
                        which one he demonstrated in?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I don't know. I can't quite place him, but I guess he might have been.
                    Another one of the things that happened then was that even within our embassy,
                    there were differences of view, of course, about Vietnam. And I remember that we
                    had a USIS officer who had come into the Foreign Service with me who was
                    stationed there, very much against the war, and one of his jobs was to explain
                    our position on Vietnam to people who called or wrote in, and he found this so
                    distasteful that he quit that service. And he was a person who was never able
                    to, or maybe he didn't want to, make the distinction between what the US
                    Government had as its position and what he himself thought personally. He didn't
                    seem to realize that when people called in they didn't care what he thought,
                    they cared what the US Government thought.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I think it's always these things. People say, “Aw,
                        the poor bright guy shouldn't have been put in that position,” but in a way
                        it's a good weeding-out process, because there'll be other things, too. From
                        the reflection of the Ambassador or the DCM and also in your other jobs,
                        what was your feeling toward the Labor Party in that time?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0032" n="Page0032"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, Wilson was prime minister then. As I remember it, I think Wilson
                    himself was well regarded. He was a very able politician, a very smart man. Our
                    embassy, the political section, of course, had lots of links with both parties,
                    and in fact, the political counselor scored a bit of a triumph by having become
                    very close to a Conservative politician by the name of Ted Heath, who later, of
                    course, became prime minister. But I don't know that I can shed much more light
                    than that on your question.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In your time as aide, what was your impression of the
                        Ambassador's social life? Was it pretty much focused on the political
                        establishment and the media, or did it get off into the higher reaches of
                        the royals and all that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I don't think it got much into the reaches of the royals. First of all,
                    let me say that I'm sure the Ambassador did lots of things that I was not aware
                    of . I don't remember his being involved with the Royal Family. I do think that
                    he was involved with a number of politicians, which he ought to have been. That
                    was the right thing to have done. And I'm sure that he must have entertained
                    lots of people from the United States, lots of Republicans and other people that
                    he knew, but within British society—and I'm sure he knew lots of people one way
                    or another in British society—what I do remember are various politicians,
                    political figures, that he entertained, as he should have done as part of his
                    job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The group of visitors from the United States, I would
                        think that this would be almost a traffic control problem. So many visitors
                        would come from so many levels of government and from outside and all
                        that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, there were lots and lots of them. And of course, the embassy itself
                    was huge, so there were lots of people to take care of these visitors, but as
                    you can imagine, there was a steady stream of State Department official,
                    congressmen, and others who traipsed through our halls.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you went down to be in the commercial section, what
                        was your work, mainly?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0033" n="Page0033"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: The work was mainly to try to promote American exports. The section was
                    divided among different kinds of products, so that one officer had
                    high-technology products, for example. I had consumer products and other things.
                    I also had a kind of sideline, which was the steel industry, with which we had a
                    certain number of policy matters to take up, particularly involving the
                    so-called “voluntary restraints” arrangement, which, as I'm sure you know, was a
                    commercial policy of ours the effect of which was to limit exports of steel into
                    the United States from various steel-producing countries and do it in a way that
                    did not require legislation or the imposition of quotas or anything like that,
                    but which was “voluntary.” Of course, it wasn't really voluntary, but more
                    voluntary than the alternatives. And since the UK was a big steel-producer, that
                    was a big item on our agenda.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have problems with that, or was it just a matter
                        of sort of monitoring?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: It was a matter of monitoring it, keeping up to speed on what was going
                    on in the different parts of the steel industry. I'm sure at levels higher than
                    mine there was some knocking of heads, but that did not impede my work.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about consumer products? Did you feel the British
                        market was pretty open as far as, I assume, things like Post Toasties or
                        sportswear or what have you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, I think so. In fact, we had in the area of sportswear and men's wear
                    and the entire textile area, we had large trade shows come from the United
                    States. There was, as I think everywhere in the world in the fashion area, a
                    broad acceptance of things made in the United States, and even at that time,
                    even with a certain amount of anti-Americanism in the air, among the young,
                    there was a certain fascination with American pop culture, and that all played
                    to our benefit.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find, as you mixed in British society, that your
                        time in Vietnam... How old were you then?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: In 1970, I was 30 years old.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you're still part of the youth generation, pretty
                        young, and I would have thought that the people you were meeting, the
                        British society, would give you a difficult time for your time in
                        Vietnam.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0034" n="Page0034"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Oh, they did, yes, they did. That is correct. One of my friends even
                    before I went there was a man named Malcolm Dean, a man who was and still is
                    with the Guardian, which is a leftist newspaper, and so many of the people that
                    I met I met through him, and they all tended to think more or less alike, and
                    the one thing that they knew for sure was that we were wrong in Vietnam. And so
                    yes, this was a kind of constant feature of life.</p>
                <p>On the other hand, I also met young Conservatives, who held quite a different
                    view. One of the people that I met then that I still have a little bit of
                    contact with every now and then was a man named Ian Sproat, who was at one time
                    during those years the youngest M.P. in the British Parliament—he is still
                    around, although he might have lost out this last time—and became a junior
                    minister later on. But he, in fact, took a big interest in Vietnam and visited
                    Vietnam and met John Vann in Vietnam as well as when Vann came to London, if I'm
                    not mistaken. So he and other Conservatives that I met took quite a different
                    view. But I would say that most of the people that I knew were on the left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Guardian crowd that you knew? How did they
                        view the Soviet Union at that time, '70-'72?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Oh, I'm not sure I remember any conversations about the Soviet Union. I
                    could make some guesses. I suppose that, if pressed, they would acknowledge that
                    the Soviet Union had done a number of bad things, but probably they would have
                    added that our approach to the Soviet Union was often unnecessarily harsh and we
                    should be nurturing the people in the USSR who were more moderate. I imagine
                    that's the kind of line they would have taken.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You left London in '72, and where to?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0035" n="Page0035"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: I came back to Washington, and I was in the economics course. That was a
                    three-or four-month course at that time. It began in the beginning of the
                    summer, the one that I took, and I did not finish it quite because I was called
                    back to Vietnam. And that, I think, was a very interesting phenomenon. You know,
                    I would say that almost all of us who went to Vietnam initially went there
                    kicking and screaming. That's the last place most of us wanted to go. In fact, a
                    number of people, until they had gotten in the Foreign Service, I'm sure, had
                    taken every measure they could to keep themselves from being sent to Vietnam. So
                    there we all were, and most of us were sent there, and most of us didn't want to
                    be sent there. However, in 1972, many of us were going to be asked to go back a
                    second time, and I remember that we were called, those of us who were supposed
                    to go, to the State Department Operations Center by U. Alexis Johnson, and he
                    was the one who gave us our initial talk, briefing, about what we were to do and
                    how this came about. I always have imagined that this presented the powers that
                    were in the State Department with a bit of a problem. The whole idea was to send
                    people to monitor the observance of the peace agreement, which was coming up and
                    which, indeed, was signed in the beginning of 1973.</p>
                <p>So as the signing drew closer and as the Department was preparing for it, it
                    decided that it would send people out to do this monitoring. Well, it didn't
                    make much sense to send brand new people to Vietnam to do this, they must have
                    figured; they had to send people who had already been there. But how were they
                    going to do this? They'd already asked people to go to Vietnam once; how were
                    they going to ask them to go to Vietnam again? Well, I guess they must have
                    thought, We will design a program that will be as attractive as possible. We'll
                    only tell them they have to go for six months. They can have an R &amp; R in the
                    middle of that and either go back to their post or go to Washington, which meant
                    in practice that you could go anywhere in the world that you wanted. And we'll
                    give them the normal hardship pay of 24 per cent more than their salary. And
                    then at the other end, we'll seal it off, however, by saying that if you're
                    called, you have to go; this is not a volunteer situation. So having done that,
                    they drew up a list of people, and they notified all of us, and do you know what
                    happened? Something that I'm sure surprised everybody. Instead of having a hard
                    time getting to go, people were coming out of the woodwork anxious to go back to
                    Vietnam. In fact, the personnel bureau was getting phone calls saying “Hey, how
                    come my name's not on the list to go back to Vietnam?” So the way it turned out,
                    they had no trouble getting people to go back to Vietnam, so much so that those
                    who really didn't want to go, as I remember it, were excused because so many
                    people did want to go. And that is very revealing, I think, of the way that
                    service in Vietnam grabbed on to people and turned people who were initially
                    very reluctant to go into people who found the whole experience really
                    fascinating.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Also, I think, this is also at a certain point, having
                        been through it once, and this is a new thing, and wanting to be—this is
                        where the action was.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: That's true.</p>

                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But there is this attraction to that. You were there from
                        really about '73, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, the beginning of '73, January of '73, I believe, until the end,
                    which was, of course, April 30, 1975.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So this was not a six-month tour.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Not for me, because I extended.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about family?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I was not married then. I didn't get married until 1976, so that was not
                    a consideration at the time. It was, of course, a consideration for a lot of
                    other people.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you went out there in '73, what was the word of
                        wisdom within the State Department of the Vietnam hands about these peace
                        accords that were coming up and all. What was the mood before you got out
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I think everybody was delighted that the war seemed to be coming to an
                    end, did come to an end, at least temporarily. I think there was a lot of
                    skepticism about how effective the peace accords would turn out to be,
                    skepticism which proved very well founded. But I guess if you had taken a poll
                    of the people who went out there, I'm sure you would have found a whole spectrum
                    of views about what was going to happen, probably weighted on the skeptical
                    side.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So you got out there in '73, and you were doing what? Did
                        you have several jobs, or—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, I had a whole series of jobs. I went back to Can Tho in the Delta,
                    and we formed a new structure. At that point, with the signing of the peace
                    accords, we founded consulates general in each of the four military corps, which
                    became the focal point of our activities and replaced the CORDs structure which
                    was there before.</p>
                <pb facs="0037" n="Page0037"/>
                <p>So I went down to IV Corps. The man who was named to be the consul general was
                    Tom Barnes. Tom Barnes was an extremely bright, very dynamic and idiosyncratic
                    guy, who was, by the way, a close associate and admirer of John Vann. In fact he
                    had been John Vann's deputy when Vann was killed up in II Corps. He was a
                    terrific language speaker. He spoke Vietnamese and learned many other languages
                    and was tough as nails and was probably an admirable choice for the job that he
                    was assigned to. And I think that despite his having been a man who was really
                    tough in his evaluations of people and in the way he did business—cold-blooded,
                    I think, is the word comes to mind—he left that six-month stint held in very
                    high esteem by those of us who worked for him.</p>
                <p>I might tell you that one of the things that Tom Barnes did which I've never seen
                    anyone else do in the Foreign Service—Barnes was, of course, a career Foreign
                    Service officer—he had about 16 of us working for him, that is, 16 young
                    officers who were his staff, as well as a deputy, who was Frank Wisner. And he
                    first of all said that all of us were to be called vice-consuls. Well, this
                    rankled some people who felt that that title was too low for them. Maybe they
                    had had a higher one somewhere else. At any rate, some people didn't like it. He
                    wanted everybody to be, first of all, on an equal footing and, secondly, easily
                    distinguishable from himself, who was the consul general. But the thing that he
                    did that really raised some eyebrows was in the way he evaluated people. He
                    evaluated us against one another. That is, he would say, “I'm going to rank all
                    of you. One of you is going to be first, one of you is going to second, and one
                    of you is going to be 16th,” or words to that effect. And he carried that over,
                    not totally but to some degree, to our written evaluations. He would say
                    something like, “Mr. Jones did a fine job here. Among 16 officers, he was in the
                    top half,” or the top third, or maybe even better. I don't remember how he
                    phrased things for people who were in the bottom half or the bottom third. He
                    may have been silent on that, but I don't know. But anyway, he'd let all of us
                    know where he thought we ranked among our peers. As I say, he carried it over
                    into our evaluations to some degree, which I've never seen done anywhere else in
                    the Foreign Service. And of course, you had to be an awfully strong character to
                    have even thought of such a thing, let alone done it.</p>

                <p>WRIGHT: Several things. At first, I was down in Chung Tien Province, which was in
                    the middle of the Delta. I don't think I stayed down there for very long,
                    several weeks probably, and I reported back what was going on on the ground down
                    there. Then I went up to Can Tho, to the headquarters, and I was one of the
                    officers assigned to headquarters. And I guess I must have traveled around some.
                    I had already been in the Delta, unlike a lot of other people there, and so I
                    knew the lay of the land better than most people, although some of the other
                    people had also been there in different provinces. Desaix Anderson, for example,
                    was one of the young officers. He had been in My Tho, and he came back. Then I
                    became a kind of reports officer, I guess, for a while, working with Frank
                    Wisner, and then, as the six months drew to an end, I decided to extend, and I
                    became, at some point, the person who was going to stay and be the number two at
                    the consulate general. I'm not quite sure when Tom Barnes left, probably June or
                    July. I believe then that Frank Wisner was acting consul general for a while. In
                    fact, he was until the arrival of the new consul general, who was Wolf Lehmann.
                    And then I think Frank left soon after Lehmann arrived, and I became Lehmann's
                    deputy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were we doing there, I mean, all over? What was the
                        idea of this group down in the Delta and, by inference, what the other ones
                        were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, we were doing a certain amount of the same things that we were
                    doing before in a diminished way, but first of all, we were doing a lot of
                    reporting. We were trying to report on the observance of the peace agreement. We
                    were reporting, for example, any outbreaks of fighting that occurred. We were
                    reporting the movements of the South Vietnamese forces and, to the extent that
                    we could, of the enemy's forces. We were reporting the activities and watching
                    the activities of the ICCS, the International Control Commission, which was
                    composed of the Canadians, the Polish, the Hungarians—it seems to me there were
                    four of them, had to be—I'm forgetting somebody—Indonesia. And for them, the Can
                    Tho area was Region VII. And so we got to know a number of them, and we were
                    very interested in what they were doing. At the same time, a lot of the world
                    development effort that we had been doing in the Delta for some years we
                    continued to do with, however, very much diminished personnel. We still had a
                    kind of “rump” CORDs structure out there. We had AID people in the different
                    provinces. But as time went on, that became smaller and smaller, so that by the
                    time that Wolf Lehmann, after he had been there a year or so, went up to Saigon
                    to become DCM, which was in about April of 1974, I had become acting consul
                    general, and there were about 100 Americans working in the Delta.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was happening in the Delta? The peace accords
                        had been signed. Immediately prior to the peace accords, had there been much
                        enemy North Vietnamese-Viet Cong activity there, and during the time you
                        were part of this team, what was happening? What were the South Vietnamese
                        doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0039" n="Page0039"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: It started off quite well. The South Vietnamese were going around trying
                    to clean things up, which they should not have been doing if they had been
                    observing the peace accords strictly. But both sides were violating it to some
                    degree. The Communists, too, were jockeying for position, trying to stash people
                    here and there. The main thing that happened, however, I would say, over that
                    year and a half period, was the progressive disarming of our side, so that I can
                    remember, when I became acting consul general, in April or so of 1974, we did a
                    long cable from the Delta, which I wish I still had. I remember it was 16 pages,
                    and it was an analysis of the situation, and it was a very pessimistic cable
                    because by that time the arms and munitions available to the South Vietnamese
                    army had really gone down to a worrying degree. There were starting to be a lot
                    more desertions. Whereas before a platoon, say, in an outpost which had been
                    used to expending a huge amount of mortars and rockets as a matter of course, in
                    fact, wastefully so, they were now down to maybe a quota of one or two mortars
                    per day. And all this was starting to tell on the morale of the South
                    Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was this a deliberate policy on our part, or what was
                        causing this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I guess overall, the US Congress was causing it because they were
                    reluctant to commit more funds to the Vietnam War. And I guess in the winter of
                    that year, 1974, November, December, a Congressional delegation came out to
                    Vietnam to take a hard look at what our situation was, and a huge amount of
                    effort was expended by Ambassador Martin and the whole embassy to try to
                    convince them that this was doable and winnable and that we had to stick it out,
                    and that was largely a failure. They went back, and they greatly cut down the
                    amount of aid to Vietnam.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you getting from these congressmen? Were they
                        essentially saying, “They're not going to win, and so we might as well just
                        not put money down a rat hole”?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0040" n="Page0040"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, you had a certain number of them, like Bella Abzug, I think was
                    here, who were against the war all along anyway. I'm not sure I can answer your
                    question with precision. I don't remember conversations of that kind with
                    members, and so I don't want to mischaracterize them, but I think the overall
                    feeling was that this was enough. If they can't do it now, with all of the huge
                    amount of help that we've given them, then giving them more is not going to do
                    the trick. Now, one of the things, also, that I'm sure some of them thought,
                    because it was an idea that was floating around at the time and afterwards, was
                    that the South Vietnamese were just playing possum; that is, that they really
                    had a huge cache of arms of various kinds but they were doling them out in a
                    stingy way in order to give us an impression that they were on their last legs.
                    This idea gained a certain amount of currency, and it has been addressed, very
                    forcefully, by General John Murray. John Murray was the second to the last
                    American commander in Vietnam, a logistics officer who was sent there, frankly,
                    to bring about our disengagement from Vietnam. And John Murray is still very
                    much alive, lives not far from here, and has written a number of magazine
                    articles and other things addressing this question of whether the South
                    Vietnamese army was in fact fat with munitions but choosing to behave otherwise.
                    And he says absolutely not. In fact, he believes that our failure to stay with
                    them was totally shameful.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were your relations and your impressions with the
                        Vietnamese commanders, civil and military, in the Delta, and their
                        impressions of us?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: We had different relations with different ones. I think that overall
                    there was a good deal of mistrust of us. On the other hand, they had nowhere
                    else to go, so most of them could hardly say, “Well, we're going to stop seeing
                    you.” But there was a lot of mistrust, a feeling that we were, from the
                    beginning, bending over backwards to play fair, to the benefit of the other
                    side. And then, as things went on, that became more and more acute, so much so
                    that when the final evacuation occurred, there was a great deal of fear that we
                    would be shot at by our own allies as we departed the country. That did not
                    happen, but the fact that the fear, the concern, was there shows you that there
                    was a good deal of resentment on the part of many South Vietnamese at our
                    policies and our behavior.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did the situation, while you were in the Delta,
                        change?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0041" n="Page0041"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Oh, yes. It deteriorated greatly. You know, at the beginning of 1973,
                    don't forget that we had come through a period of a lot of success for the South
                    Vietnamese Government. I would say that from the time that I arrived there in
                    1969—don't forget that the last American ground troops left the Delta in 1969,
                    that is, six years before the end of the war—and so all of the ground activity
                    conducted in the Delta for the last six years of the war was done by Vietnamese
                    troops. And there was a tremendous amount of progress made. There were big areas
                    that were opened up to normal activity which had been under the control of the
                    Communists. In 1974, when Terry McNamara, who has just written a book on this
                    subject, came back to the Delta—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It's called Retreat with Honor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: That's right, and it's a very good book, I think. I've read about half of
                    it, and it's excellent. But he describes his surprise when he came back in late
                    1974 at the degree to which areas that had previously been under Communist
                    control were no longer so. So even that late, after all this deterioration near
                    the end, McNamara could come back and see that things were still a lot better
                    than they had been three years before. So what happened during that last year
                    and a half was a very sad and rapid deterioration of conditions in the Delta,
                    which of course, culminated in the takeover by the Communists in 1975.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, they were split along political lines, and that was very evident.
                    The Communist members of the Control Commission were continually trying to see
                    things in a way favorable to the Communist side, and the Canadians—who, by the
                    way, dropped out after a certain point—and the Indonesians were on the other
                    side.</p>
                <p>

                        the Canadians were pretty sound, I mean quite sound, and the Indians were
                        wishy-washy and the Poles were agents of the other side, so—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, exactly right.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I guess that's right, and in fact, that's what impelled the Canadians to
                    leave. They had been threatening to leave for some time, and I didn't think they
                    would, but indeed they did.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, there were. In fact, I would say in the second half of 1973, maybe
                    early 1974—no let's say the first half of 1974 particularly—we were getting
                    reports of killings—I 'm not sure massacres is the right word, but killings—and
                    people fleeing from Cambodia into Vietnam in northern Chao Duc Province. So much
                    so that one of the people that was working in our consulate general, Ken Quinn,
                    who is now ambassador to Cambodia, did a series of superb reports, which I think
                    were the first intimation of what the Khmer Rouge were doing and would later do
                    to a horrifying degree in Cambodia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have American military observers around who were
                        able to feed in information about the effectiveness of the ARVN, the Army of
                        the Republic of Vietnam?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, I'm trying to remember whether we had military people attached to
                    the consulate general. I know that we had people who came from Saigon, and I
                    know, for example, that retired General Charlie Timmes used to come down from
                    the embassy and talk with the commanders. His special job was to interface with
                    the generals, the people that he had known before in Vietnam, and try to get
                    their candid views of what was going on. So he would come down and make the
                    rounds and talk to people and go back and write reports. So that's one way in
                    which the embassy attempted to keep track of what was going on militarily.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: As you were seeing what you felt was a situation beginning
                        to deteriorate, were you, or at least your group there, sort of making
                        mental plans about what to do if the thing fell apart? I mean, were you
                        feeling that that could come about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: No, not at that point. We were worried about the situation, and in fact,
                    in the cable that I told you about before, which gave a very pessimistic
                    assessment... That cable went to Saigon but was never passed on to Washington.
                    And Ambassador Martin, who ran things with an iron hand—that's the way he had
                    the embassy structured. The consulates reported only to Saigon, and Saigon
                    looked at it and decided what to pass on to Washington, and it did not pass that
                    on to Washington. Once later, when I went up to Saigon to work, I was in a
                    conversation with Martin in his office, I think I brought up why my cable had
                    not been sent, and he was very much aware of it, and he said that he was
                    reporting other things and he feared that that would have created—I forgot how
                    he put it—a misimpression in Washington. Of course, that was very consistent
                    with Martin's management of the news, which in the end did not serve him very
                    well, because he became distrusted by the press and others for his consistently
                    over-optimistic depictions of what was happening</p>

                        you say, “Well, I did this cable; it never went out.” Did you have the

                    Lowenstein at the point.</p>

                    Lowenstein. They came down, and I talked to them, and in fact, they mentioned my
                    cable in one of their reports. They didn't have the cable, but they mentioned
                    it. So I think that, as a constant during the Vietnam War, Washington had a good
                    idea of what was going on. You know, Daniel Ellsberg has written an essay on
                    that subject, wrote it a long time ago, in which he contended that although many
                    mistakes were made in decisions on the Vietnam War through the years by the
                    various presidents involved, none of them emanated from bad information.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did the media come down to you? Did you see a
                        difference in who the people were, superstars gone, and that sort of thing?
                        What did you feel about it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: They did come down. That's a good question. I did see various media
                    people in Saigon. I'm trying to remember. Yes, Peter Kann was still there, and I
                    can remember once that Peter Kann came to the Delta, Wall Street Journal. I knew
                    very well Gavin Scott of Time Magazine, who came down there once, although it
                    was after I'd left. But yes, people did come down, and because there was still a
                    large press corps in Saigon. I'd have to think some more about your question to
                    compare it to what had been going on, say, two or three years before, but I
                    think the general answer is yes, there was still a fair amount of interest in
                    what was going on in the Delta.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: In I believe it was probably early September of 1974.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What job did you come up to?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I came up to the job of deputy director of the internal unit of the
                    political section.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How big was our embassy at that point. Let's look at the
                        political section.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: The political section must have had 20 people or so, and it was divided
                    into the internal unit, the external unit—or was it? I guess the external unit
                    was small and had with our relations with different embassies. And then there
                    was the Pol-Mil unit, which was probably three or four officers.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you think of this huge section with an ambassador on
                        top who's trying to keep the news from going out, essentially, from accounts
                        anyway, that he's essentially trying to create or control what news goes
                        out, it's sort of an unworldly situation.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes. Now don't forget that first of all, some of the people who were in
                    the political section, at least—I don't want to overstate myself—were people
                    whom Martin brought with him. In fact, a number of the people in the embassy
                    were people whom Martin had brought with him and who were—I don't want to use
                    the word loyal because that's probably over-dramatizing it and creating
                    something that I don't necessarily think was true—but people that he had known
                    for some time and who probably to some degree thought as he did. At the same
                    time, the history of that last year or so has in it several instances of people
                    who had a falling-out with Martin and left because of it. I can think of three
                    or so right off the bat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0045" n="Page0045"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, one would have been the guy who was the head of the Pol-Mil unit
                    after Danang fell and he came back from Danang: Al Francis, who was a long
                    associate of Martin and had been brought to the country by Martin. He was a very
                    strong personality. He became convinced, near the end, that there was no chance
                    that the South Vietnamese could win. And I don't know any more what the
                    specifics of his views were, but I think generally they were that we had to
                    start to base our tactics on something other than the hope that the South
                    Vietnamese could hold out. And he left some weeks before the end. Ken
                    Moorefield, who had been aide to the ambassador and had very much distinguished
                    himself in the final evacuation—again I don't remember the specifics, but I
                    believe his transfer out of his job was accompanied by a bit of a falling-out
                    with Martin. Another one, probably more dramatic, had to do with Lannon Walker,
                    whom Martin had brought to Vietnam to be the administrative counselor. Lannon
                    did have a falling out with Martin and left. Then there's the case of the Air
                    Force general, whose name I don't remember, who jumped the gun on spiriting
                    Vietnamese out of Vietnam who worked for him, who found himself on the next
                    plane out, who was fired and attacked by Martin for having done that. I can
                    probably think of a few others.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you got there in September of '74, did you find a
                        different atmosphere in the internal political section than you'd felt out
                        in the field?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I suppose so, and particularly as the time approached for the evacuation.
                    There was increasing tension and increasing worry, by myself too and others,
                    that we were not starting preparations for the evacuation fast enough. Shep
                    Lowman, head of the internal unit, was my boss. Shep felt the same way. Ken
                    Quinn, by that time, was back in the NSC. He had been out, I believe, on a
                    Congressional delegation. He too was worried. Some of these people were worried
                    because they actually had families back in Vietnam, Ken Quinn being one of them,
                    married to a Vietnamese so worried on that account and for broader reasons. But
                    at any rate, Martin was very reluctant to begin overt preparations for an
                    evacuation, and I think that, even though he's been greatly criticized for that,
                    there were very good reasons why he should have been worried about that. We had
                    just seen Danang fall apart in a horrible chaos. We had just seen more recently
                    Nha Trang fall apart and its people having to flee at short notice. And I'm sure
                    that Martin had to be greatly worried at the prospect that there could be that
                    kind of chaos in Saigon, which would have endangered the lives of all of us, as
                    well as lives of the Vietnamese. So I don't fault Martin for being very, very
                    careful here, even though I was worried that he was leaving things until too
                    late.</p>
                <pb facs="0046" n="Page0046"/>
                <p>Martin did do another thing, though, that I think was ill-advised. Martin had a
                    kind of divide-and-rule approach to management, and he would have two different
                    people working on the same thing, or he would have people working on things
                    whose lines of authority were not very clear, and I believe that he did that
                    very much on purpose. And one of the results of this was that the evacuation
                    itself suffered from this kind of thing. I can remember that on the night before
                    the final evacuation, we were all called into the embassy very late at night,
                    those of us who were involved in the evacuation—that was 15 or 20 people—and at
                    that late date it was not clear who was in charge of the meeting, who was in
                    charge of the evacuation. And I believe that the two people who were contenders
                    were Jim Devine, who was at that point, I believe, the head of the
                    political-military unit, and—I'm trying to think of who else. Maybe it was the
                    former colonel...</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. I know who you mean. We can fill that in later.
                        He was the colonel who was in—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Jake Jacobson. It was those two, and it was not clear which one of them
                    was in charge; at least it was not clear to me. So that's an example of what
                    happened.</p>
                <p>A much more serious example of this lack of coordination was what happened on the
                    day itself. I think particularly of what happened with Ken Moorefield, who, like
                    me, was out riding buses around trying to take people to the airport. Some time
                    before, a couple of the AID people, Mel Chaplin being one—I forget the other
                    one—had what seemed at first like a crazy idea but was not, and that is that,
                    added to airlift capability, we should have some barges down on the river to
                    take people out. And these two guys helped set that up. It was their idea, as I
                    remember it, and they helped set this up. And by the way, thousands and
                    thousands of Vietnamese got out this way, in the end. But not everybody knew
                    about the barges, so Ken Moorefield was unable for some reason to get the people
                    on his bus, at least at one point, to the airport, and he had to abandon them.
                    Had he known about the barges, he could have taken these people there and they
                    would have gotten out. So that's an example of a very poor coordination that had
                    a very bad effect.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you talk about how this developed, the collapse, and
                        how you were seen and what were getting?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0047" n="Page0047"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: The collapse occurred because President Thieu implemented a policy, or
                    strategy, which had been talked about for some time, but he did it in an
                    extremely poor way. The strategy was, as things became more and more dire, and
                    as South Vietnamese capabilities diminished, to cede the northern part of the
                    country to the other side and pull back and defend the rest. I heard that this
                    idea originated with General John Murray. In the event—and by they way, nothing
                    more dramatically shows the distrust between the South Vietnamese Government and
                    us than this—what happened was that Thieu decided on his own to implement this
                    strategy. Our charg� d'affaires (Martin was in the United States), Wolf Lehmann,
                    was over at the Presidential Palace, if I remember correctly, on the very day
                    that Thieu issued this order, and Thieu neglected to mention it to him. And
                    Thieu, I believe, called his commanders down to Saigon and ordered them, within
                    a day or two or three, to implement this pullback. And it turned out to be a
                    horrible disaster, and as soon as it occurred, that is within several days, it
                    was clear that everything was over, that it would only be a matter of a few
                    weeks before the end would be definitive.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Say, in the political section you had people out in the
                        field all over the place. Were you making an effort without
                        over-consultation with the Ambassador to get your people in and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, I think events were taking care of that. I'm not quite sure of the
                    time frames now, but I guess very early on must have occurred the fall of
                    Danang, probably within a week or a shorter time of the decision to pull back.
                    That occurred, I guess, as soon as General Ngo Quang Truong was drawn into this,
                    and he had to reverse course on an instant's notice and lost his entire army.
                    And I guess that must have involved the fall of Danang, so that it was events
                    that were forcing all this. Now in the Delta, this was not occurring. There was
                    no pullback there, for example, although I'm sure that as soon as this occurred
                    this greatly heightened the need to prepare for their own evacuation. But I
                    don't believe it involved the pullback of any personnel. But anyway, it was
                    clear to everybody, I think, as soon as events occurred, what the dangers were.
                    I guess one question is whether people started to be pulled back from Nha Trang
                    at this time. I think that Nha Trang, if it remember correctly, was not overrun.
                    I'm not sure about this; I don't quite remember that Nha Trang was overrun. I
                    don't think so. I think that as the situation became very dangerous very fast,
                    our people evacuated, if I'm not mistaken, but had to do so very, very quickly,
                    not in much of an orderly way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, what was the atmosphere when all this was happening
                        in the political section, and maybe from your CIA colleagues and
                        others?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, we were getting a lot of our information from our CIA colleagues.
                    They're the people that at that point were getting reports from the field,
                    mostly, so a lot of our information was coming through them. I was in a fair
                    amount of contact with Frank Snepp at that point, and he was the source of a
                    certain amount of our information.</p>
                <pb facs="0048" n="Page0048"/>
                <p>By the way, one of the things that was occurring was that the South Vietnamese
                    were, in a sense, the last to know, because their information was what they
                    could get either by word of mouth or over official channels. And even though
                    there was a great deal of alarm, I think it's fair to say there was not very
                    good information coming out about all of this. And I remember at one point
                    Ambassador Martin badgered Alan Carter to go on television and say, in effect,
                    that things are under control. And Carter, I think against his better judgment,
                    did this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was he?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I'm sorry. Alan Carter was the head of USIS. And gained the opprobrium of
                    a great many Vietnamese who later saw that this was not the way things were at
                    all, but who, at the time, had a certain amount of faith in it because they
                    thought, well, this is the official word of the American Government. It must be
                    right.</p>
                <p>But back to the political section, I think that once the retreat had been botched
                    up, it was pretty clear to almost everybody that the end was near, and now it
                    was a matter of trying to accelerate preparations for an evacuation and to move
                    ahead like that and try to not delay things until it was too late. One of the
                    things that we were doing that really sounds almost comical from this vantage
                    point was to make lists of people—Vietnamese—that we were going to try to
                    evacuate with us. The intention was good but the task was monumental. We were
                    trying to look first of all at categories of people that we would try to
                    evacuate—the legislature, the judiciary, the high-ranking military people, and
                    so on, others who had been close to us, generally people who we felt would be in
                    danger if they did not leave. And we had long lists of these kinds of people. I
                    suppose that it was of some help at the end, and in fact, there was some order
                    to the way we did things. In the final ten days, Martin put me in charge of
                    getting out the Vietnamese families of Americans, and I did that, I and others,
                    by choosing safe houses. We would get word to people, let us say, a mother- and
                    father-in-law of an American officer and their family and tell them to appear at
                    a safe house the following morning, and we would take them in a bus to the
                    airport and they would leave. And we did this for about the last ten days, and I
                    would say that we got out about a thousand people in that way. But of course
                    that was only one of the things that was going on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you driving buses now, or did that happen later
                        on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: That happened later on. I usually stayed back at the safe house. Other
                    people drove the buses, Phil McBride, for example, Art Cobler and several others
                    who kind of came and went during that period.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0049" n="Page0049"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you having any problems with people like Lionel
                        Rosenblatt and all, or problems with Foreign Service officers who had
                        friends, family and all and just sort of took leave and appeared there. Did
                        they work with you, or how did that work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, they were there. I wouldn't call it a problem, although it was a
                    problem for the embassy. I can remember Wolf Lehmann looking at me sternly and
                    saying, “If you see Lionel Rosenblatt, you be sure to get back to me and tell
                    me.” I did see Lionel Rosenblatt. I neglected to get back to the DCM about it.
                    Lionel did show up at least once at one of our safe houses, so I did run into
                    him during that period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: But they were getting his friends and family out, weren't
                        they.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, not family, but people who had worked with him. I might tell you
                    that years later I spent a day with Henry Kissinger in the refugee camps in
                    Thailand, probably about 1986, so I had a long time to talk to him about the
                    Vietnam War. And Kissinger said at one point, “You know, with regard to Lionel
                    Rosenblatt and Craig Johnstone, when they came back, I had to lecture them about
                    what they had done, but I privately admired them a great deal for having done
                    it.” So, yes, Lionel came, and I guess he was there for three or four days and
                    then left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So how did this whole thing culminate for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, we carried out our evacuation effort until the last day. As I
                    mentioned, the night before the last day we had a meeting, and by then I guess
                    the intelligence was such that we knew there was only one more day. And so we
                    were told to pull out all the stops the following day. And then, as if to
                    confirm that, that night—in fact maybe we already knew this at the time, I don't
                    know—the airport was shelled, rendering it unusable by big fixed-wing aircraft.
                    The Ambassador drove out to the airport, against everyone's advice, that morning
                    about 10, and came back and definitively ordered the final evacuation. So on
                    that last day, there was still a 24-hour curfew in effect, so there was nobody
                    on the streets, or practically nobody, at the beginning of the day. I was in the
                    embassy early. I only lived about a block away, so I just walked over. In fact,
                    I walked over very early because I could hear the airport being bombed, which is
                    a disturbing sound. So I got in at six or seven o'clock, and there were a number
                    of people there already, so we started gearing up to make our final rounds. I
                    guess we must have already, the previous day, let certain people know to be at
                    what was on that day our safe house, because there were people there. And
                    starting, I guess, about noon or so, maybe earlier, Joe McBride and I started
                    going to the safe house and driving people to the airport.</p>
                <pb facs="0050" n="Page0050"/>
                <p>I can remember poignant scenes from that day. One occurred as Joe and I were
                    there I think together at one point and taking people out from the safe house,
                    and I guess we made about three or four rounds, and on the last one—I don't
                    remember whether we knew it would be the last one, but it was—there were more
                    people there than could fit on the bus, and so the bus quickly became full.
                    Excuse me, it was probably not a bus—it was a van. The van became full. And I
                    can remember one Vietnamese man who, I'm sure, knew it was the last one, but who
                    stepped aside and gave his place to a lady and maybe some children and said,
                    “Oh, don't worry, I'll take the next one,” I'm sure knowing there would not be a
                    next one.</p>
                <p>I also remember that at one of the houses there were some people there who were
                    left. I can't quite remember who they were, but I made one last-ditch effort to
                    go around and see if anyone was there. And at that point I was driving the van,
                    and it was so crowded that I actually had one of the children sitting in my lap
                    as I was driving, and we came to the house and there sitting on the steps,
                    having been left, looking very forlorn, was a lady who had been one of our
                    employees in the Delta and who had been told to come up to be evacuated, and her
                    husband and her children, and somehow they all piled in, but had I not driven by
                    there to see if anybody was left, they might still be there.</p>
                <p>I also remember that at a certain point, probably about three o'clock, we were
                    radioed to come in by the Ambassador's office, because as the day progressed,
                    the city became more and more chaotic, and it was clear that as time went on it
                    was more and more dangerous to be out there, although it did not really fall
                    apart. And as you drove around to some areas of the city, it looked almost
                    normal. For example, I made one last attempt, as I had during the previous days,
                    to look for the brother-in-law of one of our Foreign Service officers, Al Adams,
                    and I went down into the little pathway where their house was. To do that I had
                    to park the van out in front and walk down there. And there in the midst of all
                    this turmoil, life was going on. People were hanging out their wash, and they
                    were doing the other things that you would do on a normal day. I didn't find
                    him, so I left without him.</p>
                <p>But anyway, then I went back to the embassy. Joe and I were in different vans at
                    that point. And by that point, the embassy was surrounded by people desperate to
                    get in and become a part of the evacuation. And I had a very hard time getting
                    in. I had to be actually pulled in. One of the side gates was open, and I had to
                    be pulled in by the marines, who were at the same time holding other people out.
                    So I guess I got in there at three or four o'clock, and from then until 9 p.m.,
                    when I left, I was in the embassy, up in the Ambassador's suite mostly, watching
                    things happen.</p>
                <pb facs="0051" n="Page0051"/>
                <p>The telephones, by the way, were all still working. I can remember at one point I
                    got a telephone call from a Vietnamese woman who said that they were at such and
                    such a place and didn't know what to do and the buses that were supposed to get
                    there had not come by. It was late by then. It was dark. So I said, “Well, look,
                    the only thing I can tell you to do is to go down to the barges. There are
                    barges.” She said, “I'm afraid, I'm afraid to go down there.” And I had no
                    better advice. It was a very sad conversation, and we broke off. So it was
                    really a dramatic day.</p>
                <p>A little bit of comic relief occurred near the beginning of the day. Somewhere in
                    the early morning, a Protestant missionary came up to the gate. Now at this
                    point there was almost no one on the street, still deserted. I was called down
                    to talk to him through the gate. He was an American, I believe, and he very
                    politely said, “Listen, I don't want to bother anybody. I just want to see if
                    everything's all right,” or words to that effect. And I said, “Well, you know,
                    this is probably going to be the last day. We'd be glad to let you join the
                    evacuation. Why don't you come in?” He said, “Oh, I don't want to bother
                    anybody.” So finally I said, “Look, you better get in here.” And he did.</p>
                <p>But one of the saddest things that happened on that day was that the entire
                    contingent from USIS, which was to have been evacuated, was instead abandoned.
                    First of all, all the Vietnamese employees there had been told to stay until the
                    end, and then they would be evacuated. And on the final day they were all told
                    to go to one of their buildings and to wait, and somehow the buses that were
                    supposed to appear there never did, and all these people were left. This was a
                    terribly sad thing.</p>
                <p>Alan Carter was the head of USIS, as I've already said, and one of the things
                    that I remember was Alan was wringing his hands, going desperately around the
                    embassy trying to figure out how to get buses to the people. At one point, early
                    on in the day, he was wondering how to get his deputy or one of his officers
                    back from there to the embassy, so I volunteered to go get him, because I knew
                    from having just been out, that it was not dangerous at that point and that
                    there were really very few people on the street. And I did. I went and got him,
                    brought him back to the embassy. But then, none of the rest of those people were
                    saved. And, you know it's amazing. We talked about Martin before, for whom I had
                    a lot of respect, in some ways, but in other ways he could behave badly. And I
                    can remember that after the evacuation Martin was on the ship and he was
                    interviewed. He made some kind of a disparaging remark about Alan Carter and his
                    failure to save his own people, or just enough of an intimation to let it be
                    known that he faulted Carter for this. But at any rate, it was a very dramatic
                    day, and as I said, I left at 9 p.m.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You got out by helicopter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: By helicopter off the roof, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0052" n="Page0052"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of the evacuation by
                        helicopter?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Oh, it was incredible. I mean, it was an incredible feat, when you think
                    that—I think there were about—I don't want to over state this because I'm not
                    sure of the figures—but a huge number of us were rescued on that day by those
                    helicopters, which must have made hundreds and hundreds of flights. I think
                    something like 10,000 people left in that way and were taken to the boats. Only
                    one helicopter went down. I don't think any lives were lost. Those two pilots
                    survived. And when you think of the complexity of that operation, the fact that
                    this went on far beyond the time when pilots would ordinarily have been allowed
                    to fly. Much of it was conducted at night. It was a phenomenal logistical
                    feat.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You ended up on what ship?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I'm trying to think. Was it the Ticonderoga? I believe Martin was on the
                    Blue Ridge. I think it was the Ticonderoga.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was just thinking, this might be a good point to stop,
                        at this thing, and we'll pick it up, because I would like to get your
                        impressions and all of once you're on the ship. So we've got you on April
                        30th on the ship the Ticonderoga, and we'll pick it up there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: All right, great.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, today is the 30th of March, 1998. Lacy we're on the
                        Ticonderoga. Can you describe the scene there and what was happening and
                        what you were doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, we seemed to be on there, first of all, forever. I guess it was
                    several days that we were there on the ship before we landed in Manila. Although
                    there was a lot of moving around and unsettledness, I think the mood was overall
                    a bit somber, although I must say that my recollections of the ship ride are not
                    very vivid.</p>
                <pb facs="0053" n="Page0053"/>
                <p>I remember seeing some of the people on the ship that I knew. I'm thinking right
                    now of a general whom I'd known in Vietnam for some time and who had been a
                    province chief in Vietnam and was known as a very upright and charismatic guy
                    who was always admired by the Americans because of his cleanliness and his zeal.
                    He was not always liked by the Vietnamese that he served with. He later tried to
                    go back to Vietnam. He was sent back by a group. This was well after 1975 was
                    over. He tried to go back to Vietnam from Thailand; he was never successful. He
                    was, however, a big success in the United States. I can remember reading
                    newspaper articles about him after he went to California because he started out
                    at the bottom and pretty soon had his own gas station and other businesses, as I
                    recollect, and was one of the early examples of a Vietnamese success story. At
                    any rate, he was on the ship. And I'm not sure that I can remember other people
                    on there. Obviously, there must have been lots of Americans whom I knew and
                    other Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you at this early stage—I mean obviously you were
                        terribly busy before, but when you had a little time to reflect—your initial
                        feeling was, What went wrong? Why didn't it work?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, I think we were, in a sense, beyond that. What I tried to do, what
                    I did a little bit of, was write a few notes about what had happened. I think I
                    did that on the ship. They were really very sketchy, though. I still have them,
                    but they're not anything to brag about. I wish now that I had sat down and tried
                    to do a better job of that, but I didn't. But I think that it was kind of a rest
                    after a long period of exhausting work, because in those last two weeks or so we
                    really had little time to do anything except work all day and go back home and
                    go to sleep immediately and get up early the next morning with no time even to
                    write down what you were going through. So it was really a very draining time,
                    and this was a kind of forced rest that we had put upon us, a little bit too
                    much so, as I remember, because, as I said, it seemed like that ship would never
                    get to Manila, where it was supposed to be going.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What happened when you got to Manila?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I think we were there for two or three days. People then split up. You
                    could go wherever you were going after that. We were processed through the
                    embassy, and I guess we filled out forms and things like this. One of the things
                    I remember—either on the ship or right after we got to Manila—we were asked if
                    we wanted to send messages to anybody, so I asked that one be sent to my dad in
                    Springfield, Illinois, telling him that I was okay, and then I assumed that it
                    was sent. It never was; he never heard anything saying that I was okay, so he
                    worried quite a bit between that point and the time when I finally got in touch
                    with him.</p>

                        you, but the others, the people who came out of there. Us against them, or
                        any sort of feeling, or were you all going your individual way?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, there was certainly a bond, but I don't know it was as operative at
                    that time as it would become later. I think everyone was probably worried about
                    his or her own situation at that point. For me, and I guess for any of us, now
                    that I think of it, who were in the Foreign Service or in AID or anywhere else
                    in government, our jobs had just disappeared. And so that was one—I won't say
                    preoccupation because I don't think anybody, at least not in the Foreign
                    Service, was worried that he was going to be cut adrift—but we were uncertain as
                    to where it was you were supposed to go next. What I did was to go first to Hong
                    Kong for a few days, and then, because I had no ongoing assignment, I went to
                    Paris, where I stayed for six or eight weeks and studied French and lived with
                    some French people and had a very nice time there and then went back to
                    Washington to work on the new entity that had been set up in the State
                    Department to handle the resettlement of all of the refugees who had come.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were dealing with the resettlement from when to
                        when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: The one in Washington?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I guess it must have lasted six weeks or so. It wasn't all that long.
                    This would have been, let us say, from sometime in June of 1975 until July or
                    August.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, I was a small cog in a very big machine, and one of the things that
                    I did was to attend to the reports—I think we did daily reports to the White
                    House and other parts of the State Department —on how the resettlement effort
                    was going. At that point, the Vietnamese who came out had been funneled into
                    camps in various parts of the country. There were four of them. These were
                    Indiantown Gap, in Pennsylvania; one of them was in Florida, one in Arkansas,
                    and one in California. And these were, I believe, all headed by people who had
                    been in Vietnam, Alan Carter, the head of USIS, was the director of Indiantown
                    Gap, I remember. So the refugees went to one of those places until they could be
                    sponsored out by some American, either some American individual or some group.
                    And that is the way it worked, and gradually all of them were.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the White House then?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0055" n="Page0055"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, I didn't deal with the White House myself, but I think it's fair to
                    say that the Ford White House took a very big interest in this. Needless to say,
                    it was the biggest thing happening at that point. You also had people in the
                    White House, that is, in the NSC, like Ken Quinn, who had been in Vietnam, who
                    had Vietnamese family, who personally were extremely interested in what was
                    happening. So there was, I don't think, any lack of attention from the White
                    House. And actually, I think that one could say in retrospect, that that whole
                    effort, with all its bumps, was quite a good one. There was a policy, an
                    acknowledged policy, of trying to spread the new arrivals around the country in
                    as equitable a manner as possible—equitable, that is, from the point of view of
                    the states, whose social service systems would be burdened in many cases by
                    these new arrivals. And I think that worked fairly well, even though in our
                    country nobody can tell anybody else where to live. So many of the refugees who
                    went to places that they, for one reason or another, considered inhospitable,
                    sooner or later packed their bags and went elsewhere, either to California or
                    perhaps to Texas, where there are a lot of Vietnamese, or to the Washington
                    area. Still, however, to this day, I think you will find all over our country
                    that there are Vietnamese living still from this period. There is a very large
                    group, for example, in Chicago. I would say almost anywhere you go you will find
                    Vietnamese.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: In the State Department, how were things working as far as
                        what are they going to do with you and all?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, by then I had my next assignment, which was to go to the economics
                    course, and that lasted for roughly the second half of 1975.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the course?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I think it was very good. It was probably, at that point, still overly
                    theoretical, although even at the time I was taking it that had been a common
                    criticism of the course, or comment maybe. And even then they were trying to
                    compensate for that. But I remember, for example, that we spent a lot of time
                    learning calculus, for which I never ever yet once in my life had any use of any
                    kind, certainly not practical, nor can I think of any way in which it insinuated
                    itself into my thought processes in a way that was beneficial.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, there's so much emphasis on calculus as saying this
                        is the great door that will open up things. At that time, what was calculus
                        supposed to do for you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0056" n="Page0056"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: I don't remember very well, but I guess it was supposed to allow you to
                    understand the different kinds of formulas that were used in economic analysis.
                    And by the way, the purpose of the whole course—and I think it's a correct
                    purpose—was not to make you an economist, which would not have been feasible in
                    the four or five months that the course lasted, but rather to make you
                    conversant with economics, that is, to allow you to pick up the economic section
                    of the newspaper and understand what was happening, and allow you to carry on
                    knowledgeable conversations with people about economics, to understand the
                    economic history of our own country and to be aware and to understand what was
                    going on economically in other countries. And I think, to a large extent, it
                    succeeded in doing that. It was a good course.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this six months you were sort of out of the Vietnam
                        line of fire—you had finally got out of that—did you find much retrospection
                        or interest within the State Department in Vietnam, what happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, that's a good question. There was, of course, still a good deal of
                    thrashing around by people who'd been in Vietnam in one way or another. For
                    example, there was a certain amount of talk about whether people who had gone
                    there would be rewarded symbolically in some way, given any kind of honors. And
                    that was a debate that went on for a while with an initial decision not to and
                    that provoked a lot of criticism on the part of some of the people who were
                    there. There was the start of what later eventually became the book about the
                    fall of Saigon, called Decent Interval, by Frank Snepp. Frank at that point was
                    still in the CIA. He was, however, thinking of, starting, in fact, to write his
                    book. I remember he and I met at some function once, and he was talking to me
                    about how concerned he was about his own position in his organization. And he
                    appeared to have a good case of paranoia at that point, which, I think,
                    eventually proved the truth of Kissinger's dictum, “Just because you're paranoid
                    doesn't mean they're not after you.” And they turned out to be very much after
                    Frank Snepp.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Because the book was published, and then the money was
                        confiscated and it was supposedly withdrawn, but the book is basically part
                        of the public record now.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Absolutely. In a way, it was unfair to Snepp. First of all, I think Snepp
                    wrote a magnificent book. His book is extremely well written. Journalists have
                    told me they would love to have written that book, just from the stylistic point
                    of view. It's written in an exciting way. I think it has a lot of little errors
                    in it. I think that's partly due to the fact that there was such a large sweep
                    to the events that are being described, but also more fundamentally due to the
                    fact that so many of the events that were related to events by different people
                    were related in different ways, and indeed, opposite ways. The most glaring
                    example that I can think of has to do with the case of Consul General Terry
                    McNamara in Can Tho, when he came out of the country by boat and took his staff
                    with him in what was really a tremendous adventure, and he has to be given a
                    terrific amount of credit for that. He's just written a very good book about it,
                    by the way.</p>
                <pb facs="0057" n="Page0057"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Escape With Honor.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Escape With Honor, which I haven't finished because somebody borrowed it
                    and didn't return it, but what I did read of it I really thought was excellent.
                    It was well done, and it's a good book. But from Snepp's point of view, here's a
                    case where you had the consul general in Can Tho, Terry McNamara, and his
                    station chief, whose name I forget, coming out of the same experience, each one
                    accusing the other of having skipped out and left the other and his men
                    behind—diametrically opposed versions of what happened, blame placed by the one
                    on the other and by the other on the one. It's a good example of how hard it is
                    to get to the truth in these very emotional and dramatic situations that Snepp
                    was trying to describe. So I think that's part of it. But overall, Snepp's book
                    was a terrific effort. Now, I'm told, it is the standard work on the subject, of
                    what happened at the end in Vietnam, and always will be. So Snepp really has to
                    be congratulated.</p>
                <p>Of course, I think that Snepp ran into the trouble that he did with the CIA in
                    large part because he was a victim of timing. Don't forget that this was after
                    Philip Agee had caused the CIA a tremendous amount of grief and put individual
                    CIA officers in a great deal of danger by his revelations. I think there were a
                    couple of other instances where former CIA people had written about the Agency
                    in ways that the Agency found dangerous or repugnant or both. And I think that
                    it is very probably that by the time that Snepp came along, the people in charge
                    of the Agency were saying to themselves, “We can't let somebody get away with
                    this again. We have to come down on them hard.” That's all the more unfortunate
                    for Snepp, I think, because no one ever accused Snepp, as far as I know, of
                    revealing any classified information. There's not one charge of that that I have
                    ever heard. He's simply accused of the legalistic sin of having violated his
                    commitment to the Agency not to print anything without the Agency's review.</p>
                <p>And I thought that it was ironic that later Bill Colby wrote his own memoirs, a
                    book called Honorable Men, of which I think he was certainly one—he was a
                    wonderful person and a man of tremendous intelligence and insight—but at any
                    rate, he wrote memoirs which seemed to me in some instances to have gone far
                    more vividly into things that I would not have gone into than Snepp ever did.
                    For example, in his writings about Italy, Bill Colby talks fairly openly about
                    our efforts to keep Communists out of power and about, as I remember, individual
                    members of the Italian Government that we were dealing with. Well, the problem
                    was that at that point a lot of those people were still around, so I was very
                    much surprised at that, and I don't think anything ever happened or even was
                    said to Colby about that. So again, all the more ironic that Snepp suffered
                    fairly grievously over his book, never made any money out of it, spent years of
                    his life struggling against the CIA in court, eventually lost, and so paid a big
                    price for a book which was, I think, very good. And I think maybe the most
                    unfortunate thing about is that this experience really went on to color Snepp's
                    life in a very profound way and, I think, still does.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0058" n="Page0058"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, after you left the economic course—we're talking
                        about the beginning of '76—whither?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, first of all, whither? I met my wife about that time, or re-met my
                    wife. I had known her slightly in Vietnam. She was well known at the American
                    Embassy because she was, first of all, the widow of Nguyen Van Bong, who was an
                    opposition politician and academic of real stature, who was assassinated by the
                    Communists, his car blown up in late 1971. So as a widow, Jackie was asked by
                    Ambassador Bunker, who always remained her great friend, to become the head of
                    the cultural affairs part of the VAA, the Vietnamese-American Association. So in
                    that capacity, she put on all kinds of events for that organization, art shows,
                    recitals, concerts, of which there were many, because in those days Vietnam was
                    the biggest diplomatic establishment in the world, and so there were all kinds
                    of performers and artists who came through and who did things of this nature.
                    And the Vietnamese American Association as a whole was a huge enterprise. The
                    language teaching part of it had something like 25,000 students, so it was very
                    much an active concern.</p>
                <p>So I knew Jackie very slightly in that role, although not very well, and I did
                    not meet her again and really get to know her until the summer of 1975, when I
                    ran into her one day across the street from the State Department and had the
                    good sense to ask her for her telephone number. And then Jackie and I dated and
                    eventually became engaged and were married the following year in the spring. But
                    in the meantime, I had been assigned to Milan, Italy, where I went in, I think,
                    January of 1976, where Jackie and then her children eventually joined me.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: His name was Tom Fina, whom I admired a great deal, and we had very good
                    tour there. It was a time when we had to make a lot of adjustments. I was just
                    married. Jackie was not only in a new marriage but also in a new country. Our
                    children had been in the United States then for about a year, and they were
                    again uprooted. So they had all that to contend with. I think, though, that we
                    liked Italy and stayed there for about two and a half years and then came back
                    to the United States.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a bit about Italy in '76. How would you
                        describe the situation as you saw it from the perspective of Milan.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: These were dramatic days for the Italians because of the Red Brigades.
                    There was a real reign of terror going on, which, thankfully, did not directly
                    touch Americans—at least not until General Dozier was kidnapped a couple of
                    years later—but which very much had Italians at their wit's end, I would say.
                    People that we knew, a journalist, for example, from the Corriere della sera was
                    eventually killed, a year or so after I left Milan. A couple of people that I
                    knew had their kneecaps shot. People who were wealthy lived in especial terror,
                    because they were worried about being kidnapped for ransom, as a number of them
                    were. I remember once that Tom Fina went to a dinner at the apartment of someone
                    wealthy in Milan and a one point there was a telephone call for the host, and he
                    came back into the room and he informed everyone that someone whom they all knew
                    had been kidnapped. And it became clear to Fina that this was a subject of
                    constant preoccupation for these people. He said he turned to the lady on his
                    left and he said, “How many people do you know personally who have been
                    kidnapped?” And she ticked off four or five. And he did the same thing to the
                    lady on his right. And I can remember going out to the home outside of Milan of
                    Silvio Berlusconi, who later became the Italian prime minister—even then
                    extremely wealthy. And he lived in a French Tudor villa outside of Milan totally
                    surrounded by guards. In fact, either he said this or I thought it, he had
                    practically a Sicilian village living in his courtyard, armed. He told me that
                    he didn't send his children to school. He had tutors brought in to teach
                    them.</p>
                <p>So, anyway, that was the climate in Italy at that time from a political point of
                    view. And then this was all capped by the kidnapping of Aldo Moro, who, as you
                    remember, was killed by the Red Brigades, and his body was found in the trunk of
                    a car in downtown Rome. And I remember vividly when that occurred because the
                    American Ambassador at that time, Richard Gardiner, was visiting Milan, and we
                    were in a restaurant having lunch with a politician named Spadolini. Spadolini
                    later himself became prime minister of Italy. He was not at that point even a
                    minister. And we were at Savini, which is a very nice restaurant, an old and
                    classical restaurant in the Galleria near the Duomo in downtown Milan. And our
                    group was on one side of the table and Spadolini's on the other. Our group were
                    three people, I believe, Gardiner, Tom Fina and myself, and during the lunch, I
                    was called out by a telephone call from the consulate. And I was told by my
                    secretary that the radio had just announced that Moro's body had been found. No
                    one, of course, up until that point, knew that he had been killed, until his
                    body was found. And so I went back to the table, and I went over to Gardiner and
                    stood next to him and whispered this to him, and he did not want to call this
                    across the table to Spadolini, and he asked me to walk around the table and
                    inform Spadolini, which I did. So these were dramatic times in Italy.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was our analysis and the Italian analysis of what
                        were the Red Brigades? Who were they, and what did they want?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: They were a group of people who, by the way, had links with other
                    revolutionary kinds of groups in other parts of the world, in the Middle East,
                    in Germany. It's an interesting question partially because many Italians refuse
                    to believe that this was a home-grown group of people. Many Italians seriously
                    would tell you that no Italian would do something like this. At least, not
                    unless he was totally influenced by somebody else, so it was hard for Italians
                    themselves to believe that people could get so riled up over a kind of
                    revolutionary cause to impel them to engage in this kind of violence. I might
                    also say that the Italians eventually decimated the Red Brigades, and I think
                    this is something we often fail to remember about the Italians. Sometimes we
                    don't take the Italians as seriously as we ought to. Sometimes we forget that
                    they have been tremendous allies of ours, both in the political military arena,
                    when they were the people in the 1970's who installed the missiles that we
                    wanted them to when no one else would, but also in this instance, where, you
                    know, everybody preaches that “We're not going to deal with terrorists—we're not
                    going to negotiate with them.” But most of us break that rule when the crunch
                    comes. It needs to be pointed out that when the crunch came for the Italians,
                    when their own prime minister was in the hands of the Red Brigades, a man whose
                    party was in power, was totally part of the political establishment, whose wife
                    was calling out every day to implore the government to relax its policy and deal
                    with these people, the Italian Government held absolutely firm, allowed, if I
                    can be put that way—it's probably unfair to put it that way—we shouldn't say
                    they “allowed” Moro to be killed—but stood firm in the policies that they did
                    and then, later, by the way, went out and totally mopped up the Red Brigades.
                    That calls for real backbone of a national nature, and they did it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any feel that these Red Brigades had a viable
                        agenda?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: No, I don't think so. I don't remember now what their manifestos said.
                    Certainly there was plenty wrong with Italy as a society, just as there is with
                    a lot of societies. Much of this came out and was addressed subsequently, say,
                    in the past seven or eight years, when the parties themselves were pretty much
                    decimated in the wake of all kinds of scandals, in which many politicians had
                    their careers ruined, and many of them actually went to jail and some of them
                    actually committed suicide. So there was a good deal of corruption in the
                    Italian system. There's no doubt about that. It was the way things were done.
                    There was plenty of reason for criticism about favoritism, about money changing
                    hands, and so on; and so, in that sense, there were lots of legitimate
                    complaints that could have been made about Italy and its political and social
                    system. But nothing justified the ruthlessness with which the Red Brigades
                    attacked things, and certainly no reason to believe that had the Red Brigades
                    prevailed things would have gotten better.</p>

                    <pb facs="0061" n="Page0061"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On the local level, what was the form of government that
                        you were dealing with, and how did you all find it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: In Milan, there was a coalition of the Communists and the Socialists—I
                    forget the term for it now—with the Socialists, who were the smaller party, on
                    top. That is, the mayor was Socialist. I can't remember how many cabinet posts
                    the Communists had and how many the Socialists had, but the Socialists would
                    have had more and they would have had the mayor. Then the city was part of a
                    province, and the province was part of a region. Certainly the regional
                    government was Christian-Democratic, and the head of that was a
                    Christian-Democrat. The provincial government, I'm not sure—but that was
                    probably the least important of the three. The most important government in
                    Milan was the city government. The mayor during most of the time that I was
                    there was a man named Carlo Tognioli, a Socialist, and Tognioli was a man of
                    short stature—a very short person, very self-effacing, nice man, a terrific
                    reputation as a good guy—and, in fact, remained mayor of Milan for about 10
                    years, which is an unheard-of length of time for a politician to be in that kind
                    of a post in Italy. When the kind of revolution came—and this by the way had the
                    nickname mani pulite, 'clean hands'—almost the entire Socialist Party was swept
                    up in this because it probably was the most corrupt of all the parties, and so
                    was poor Carlo Tognioli, which I think was an injustice because I don't think
                    that he was at all a corrupt person, and I think he did a very good job as
                    mayor. But he was caught up in this as well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the prevailing impression that you were getting,
                        from your own view, from Fina, and from the embassy, of the Italian
                        Communist Party and what was it's agenda and importance?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, this was a very hot debate at that time, both in Italy and within
                    the US Government, and there were different views on it. Our policy was, of
                    course, keep the Communists out at any cost—well, I shouldn't say at any cost;
                    that wouldn't be right. But our policy was that we did not want to see the
                    Communists become a part of the Italian Government. People within our
                    government, however, some of them, thought that this was too harsh; they thought
                    that, first of all, the Communists were going to eventually get into the Italian
                    Government. They called its policy and the reality was that they were going to
                    get in via “salami tactics”: a little bit at a time. And indeed, that is what
                    happened, eventually. And that when they did get in it would be better for us to
                    have been seen to have dealt with them than not to. We would retain our
                    principles. We would not change the things that we thought were right, but we
                    would not be kicking and screaming all of the way.</p>
                <pb facs="0062" n="Page0062"/>
                <p>I think the cards history eventually dealt were these. As of, say, 1976-77, the
                    people who were saying that they're going to get in and we'd better start
                    dealing with them greatly underestimated the length of time that it would take
                    them to get in. And so probably in retrospect one can say, no, there was no
                    reason why we should have helped them at all to come into power in Italy. But
                    eventually they did, and they are today still a force in Italy. How nefarious or
                    not the Communists were is, I guess, probably still a matter for debate. I don't
                    follow this very much any more. I don't know what the prevailing wisdom is on
                    this subject, but I think that from the point of view of American interests it
                    would have been very unlikely that the entry of the Communists into an Italian
                    Government, say in the 1970's or the 1980's, would have been good for us. They
                    could hardly have failed to oppose us, particularly on things like the
                    installation of the missiles in Italy and on foreign policy matters. On the
                    other hand, they were probably never as dangerous or as much against our
                    interests as some people portrayed them.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were, I assume, acting sort of as an economic officer
                        and political officer over there. Were you allowed to have contact with the
                        Communists?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: That was another sensitive question. Yes and no. I believe that this
                    changed a bit during the time that I was there, but I can remember at least at
                    one point that we could call on the Communists if they were in a government
                    position, not if they were only in a party position, although maybe even that
                    changed while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your impression of Richard Gardiner as
                        Ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Gardiner was, first of all, a very accomplished man. I don't think he was
                    formally an economist, but he was a man who knew a lot about the economy, a lot
                    about economic policy, and a man who worked very hard, took his job very
                    seriously, performed in public a great deal, studied Italian very hard and very
                    seriously, and got to be quite good in Italian, but was always very careful not
                    to overextend himself so that he got into a situation where he might say
                    something wrong or something foolish or not say something well. That is, he
                    continued for some time to use an interpreter, but actually he was studying all
                    this time, and when he did speak, he made sure that he could do the job well,
                    and he did.</p>
                <p>Even though before he arrived it was rumored, it was reported, that he would take
                    a less tough line toward the Communists, he did not. And whether that was out of
                    conviction or because he was faithfully carrying out the policy of the Jimmy
                    Carter Government, I guess you'd have to ask him. But he turned out to support a
                    very tough policy against the Communists.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Other than the Red Brigades, were there any other issues
                        that had the attention of the Consulate General?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0063" n="Page0063"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: In those days, the all-consuming question, from a political point of
                    view, about Italy, and especially if you were an American, was the Communist
                    question. It really colored everything, and it was the focus, I would say, of
                    most of our reporting. Tom Fina was an excellent political and economic
                    reporter, and we did a lot of reporting from Milan, some of which got us into a
                    little bit of trouble with the embassy, because the embassy was always worried
                    that we were overstepping our bounds, that is, reporting on Italy from a
                    national point of view rather than from a consulate point of view. And so we
                    were always up against that invisible boundary. This was made a worse dilemma,
                    from the embassy's point of view, because Fina's reporting was superb. Fina had
                    a knack with words which made his reports extremely readable and interesting, as
                    well as solid. And we used to do reports on the provinces. Either he would go
                    out or I would go out and spend the day in a province, by car usually, go around
                    and see eight or ten people, the mayor, head of the local union, the local
                    bishop, and so on, and then come back and make a report out of it. So we, I
                    would say, knew that area, from a political point of view, pretty well, and we
                    had a very good reputation for our reporting at the Department in those
                    days.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the economic side? What was the impression of
                        Italy as far as what was being done in Milan and Italy's role in the
                        economic world?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0064" n="Page0064"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Clearly, even in those days, Italy was an economic power which was often
                    underestimated by people. I think in those days, Italy was something like the
                    seventh biggest industrial economy in the world. It around that time had passed
                    up the British and had passed up the French. One of the features of the Italian
                    economy, however, always was the degree to which it was politicized. And again,
                    this is something that came out during the Clean Hands campaign. You know the
                    Italian parties in those days controlled everything. Much of the Italian economy
                    had been nationalized. You had the national oil company, telecommunications, all
                    this was nationalized, and the jobs in those companies, that is, the big
                    managerial jobs, were doled out by the parties. And by the way, each part of
                    this economic structure was known to be in the hands of one party or another. So
                    for example, in Milan, La Scala was the preserve of the Socialists. Now that
                    meant that if you wanted free tickets to La Scala, you got them from Socialist
                    politicians. It also meant that if you wanted to be the superintendent of La
                    Scala you had to be chosen by the Socialists. You could be the greatest musician
                    in the world, and that was nice, but if you were not in with the Socialist
                    Party, your chances were close to zero. And this pervaded the whole Italian
                    economy. So if you wanted—I forget which is which now—but let us say that ENI,
                    the national oil company, Ente Nazionale d'Italia, or something, I forget. The
                    head of ENI was—I think that was Socialist—appointed by the Socialists. Now it's
                    clear that that is not the best way to run an economy, and I suspect it's
                    changed a good deal now. So in a way, you can look at it either way. You can say
                    it's amazing they did so well with this kind of a system, or you could say that
                    they might have done a lot better had they been choosing people on merit rather
                    than the way that they did. But there was a great deal of prosperity in Italy at
                    that time, particularly in the North—well, you've always had the North-South
                    split, as far as that goes, and in those days, just as probably now, the
                    national government was pouring huge amounts of money into the South, in an
                    effort to raise living standards there, and the people in the North were doing
                    extremely well.</p>

                        cash, in jobs and that sort of thing. How did we feel about reporting on
                        this?</hi>

                <p>WRIGHT: I don't remember this all that well. Certainly we reported on corruption.
                    I think that just as in many countries where the Foreign Service is, the people
                    at the top of the embassy got nervous when they started thinking that people
                    were going overboard.</p>

                    reported on corruption in Italy, of which there was a great deal, but I think
                    that the embassy was probably sensitive to the danger that zealous Foreign
                    Service officers might go overboard and become investigative journalists. If
                    they had, there was plenty of material.</p>

                        missiles, and those became a very hot issue. Did you get involved in
                        that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, it was a very hot issue, and I alluded to it before by saying that
                    the Italians were almost alone in Europe, certainly the first, in allowing us to
                    place our missiles on their territory.</p>

                </p>
                <pb facs="0066" n="Page0066"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: That's a good question, and I'm not sure I have a very good answer for
                    it. We had, I would say, a unique relationship with Italy, a very close
                    relationship in a lot of ways because there were so many Italo-Americans in the
                    United States and Italo-American groups. And that relationship went on and
                    within that relationship, of course, there are all kinds of nice things that the
                    United States can do for a country. It can say yes when their leader wants to
                    see the President, for example. Or when lower level leaders come here, it can
                    say yes when they ask for appointments with people. I don't think, though, that
                    we did anything dramatic or even notable for the Italian Government in exchange
                    for this. For example, I can remember at one point—I wouldn't call this the
                    Italian Government—but people within the government were very anxious for more
                    American investment, so they wanted us to send them American businessmen. This
                    is a common misconception about the United States, which is that when the US
                    Government wants to encourage private investment in another country, it just
                    calls up some businessmen and tells them to invest. That's not the way it works,
                    and so we simply told that to the Italians. “This isn't the way our system
                    works. We'll be glad to help if you can attract businessmen, but you've got to
                    do it.” So that's one of the ways we were not able to do something that the
                    Italians wanted us to do.</p>
                <p>Much, I think, though, of what the Italians wanted from us was on the symbolic
                    rather than the real level. The Italians—and I can't speak for them now, because
                    I've been out of touch with Italian affairs, but certainly in those days—the
                    Italians had a national inferiority complex, which often came to the fore. It
                    was often operative. And often what they wanted was to be included in a meeting,
                    included in a summit. Their constant fear was to be excluded from a meeting
                    which included the big guys in Europe. Their constant obsession was to be left
                    out of a summit of the British, the French, the Germans and the Americans.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the Canadians, who also have the same problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: And this bothered them a great deal. This sensitivity of the Italians
                    about being left out of the big people, the big group in Europe has come back in
                    the last year in the form of the Security Council reform in the United Nations,
                    wherein we are supporting Security Council membership for the Japanese, the
                    Germans and, I think, the representatives of three regions to be determined by
                    the regions themselves, for a total of five or maybe six new members. The
                    Italians are just aghast at this, and the Italian Perm-Rep, the permanent
                    representative, in New York made a wonderfully facetious comment when referring
                    to the Japanese and the Germans. He said, “Hey, wait a minute! We lost the war
                    too.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Tell me, I remember reading in Henry Kissinger's book, The
                        White House Years, he referred to flying into Rome and saying that
                        everything was symbolic, but there was no, sort of, “the Leader” to talk to
                        in Italy, and that the governments are continually revolving—the same
                        people—but it wasn't as though there were a figure, a man for our President
                        to deal with, or the Secretary of State or what have you. Was this hard to
                        deal with, to get across? I mean, there just wasn't “Mr. Italy.”</hi>

                        been in the early '70's, I suppose, but I'm thinking of this even later or
                        even earlier. I mean, Andreotti would come in and out, but it wasn't as
                        though you were going in and talking to de Gaulle or talking to Adenauer or
                        somebody. The Japanese have somewhat the same problem.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I guess it's a problem, now that you bring it up, and I suppose it's
                    manifested in the need for any Italian premier to vet any big decision with the
                    other parties. I suppose the closest you've come away from this, paradoxically
                    now, is with Craxi, who lasted about two years and was a very strong Socialist
                    prime minister, but certainly, the Christian Democrats, who until recently, were
                    the dominant party in the postwar period, very dominant, even they were
                    constantly vetting things with Communists, constantly, to our great
                    discomfiture. We wanted them to do this and wanted them to do that, and they
                    claimed to want it, too. I guess one of the things it did was to make it unclear
                    to us a lot of the time whether the Christian Democrats wanted something or were
                    simply using the refusal of the Communists or the Socialists to say they
                    couldn't do it. But, yes, that was a fairly constant feature of Italian foreign
                    policy.</p>
                <p>And again, another way of putting this is that Italian foreign policy is very
                    much an adjunct to Italian domestic policy. How many Italian foreign ministers
                    can you name? Probably not very many, because they never became really national
                    figures, or they tended not to become really national figures. And Italian
                    foreign policy would always have been, in those years, subordinated to domestic
                    policy, and where the United States was concerned, even though the communists
                    were out of power nominally, they would have had, because of this feature of
                    Italian politics, a lot of say-so in what the Italian Government agreed to with
                    us.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this period, from '79 to '81, I was in Naples as
                        consul general, and I had never served in Italy before, and so was sort of
                        looking at this as the new boy on the block. In the back of my mind I keep
                        thinking, My God, we're reporting in exclusive detail on this parliamentary
                        merry-go-round that keeps changing but hasn't changed since 1948
                        practically. And I thought, we had people on their fourth or fifth tours—or
                        it seemed that way—in Italy, and they've gotten so involved in this, and
                        really we were putting far greater detail and were getting more involved in
                        the “Have the Communists moved up one percentage point?” or “What is this
                        and that?” Really, as far as I was concerned, for the Mezzogiorno, southern
                        Italy, the real problem was getting jobs. Even the mayor of Naples, Valenzi,
                        who was a Communist, wanted to make sure the Sixth Fleet didn't leave the
                        area. Did you ever get that feeling about this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Oh, yes. It was totally self-absorbing. I mean, you got caught up in this
                    analysis of how far the Communists had gotten and what were the other parties
                    doing, and it was a whole subject of human endeavor in itself. Well, you know,
                    even to read the Italian newspapers, I was always struck by the fact that in
                    order to read the typical upper-crust Italian newspaper about political matters,
                    you had to be tremendously well-schooled in Italian politics because nobody ever
                    explained anything. None of these papers would ever, for example, say, “Giulio
                    Andreotti, three-time prime minister of Italy and four times minister of foreign
                    affairs.” No, if you were reading the paper, you were supposed to know that. And
                    then even more esoteric things: when they referred to the events of June 6th,
                    well, you either knew that they meant June 6, 1964, when 18 people gathered
                    together in a town in southern Italy and said something, or you didn't. And so
                    it was like reading a coded message, and if you didn't have the code, you
                    couldn't read it. And that's just always the way that Italian politics were
                    described. So a person coming in from the outside couldn't have read about
                    Italian politics with any kind of understanding because you wouldn't know what
                    they were talking about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Italo-Americans in the United States. We

                        many congressmen with Italian names were around. They all descended on me at
                        one time, immediately. But these were people generally from southern areas,
                        Sicily, the poor areas, who really weren't plugged into or knowledgeable
                        about the real events that were occurring in the North, the major political
                        events. Did you find that they played much of a role in our dealing with
                        Italy?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0069" n="Page0069"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, a bit of a role, yes. For example, there's something called the
                    Italian-American Foundation, which I think is still very much around, and which
                    has a number of prominent Italo-Americans in it. I can't think of the man who
                    was the head while I was there. We always regarded this organization as a bit
                    retrograde in upholding views about Italy that were in large part nostalgic—very
                    anti-Communist, as I remember, and not particularly relevant. However, I can
                    tell you, when the Italian-American Foundation every year has its big dinner in
                    Washington, it invites the President and the Vice-President, and they often
                    come. But I don't think that when it comes to the really big ticket questions,
                    like theater nuclear forces, for example, that they play much of a role. I think
                    that they play a kind of on-the-ground role, if somebody who comes from Italy
                    and the Italian-American Foundation really wants somebody in the White House to
                    see them, I suppose that they can probably get that done. But I think that that
                    is often the level that they operate at. Or if there is a disaster in Italy and
                    collecting money, things like that. So I think that's largely the way it is. I
                    think on the big ticket items they don't count for much.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I did it for a year and a half, from about June of 1980 to the end of
                    1981.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Okay, what was the Kampuchea Working Group. What was the
                        genesis?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: The genesis was the catastrophe that befell the Cambodians in the wake of
                    the Pol Pot years, when the Vietnamese, at the end of 1979, invaded Cambodia.
                    Now one has to have mixed feelings about that, because they were able to drive
                    the Khmer Rouge out of Phnom Penh, which I think any right-thinking person has
                    to regard as a good thing, but at the same time, they took over the country,
                    which we regarded as a bad thing, and even worse, they created a huge number of
                    Cambodian refugees, whom we didn't want to call refugees—whom we called
                    displaced persons—who were, whatever you called them, pushed to the Thai border,
                    most of them across the border into Thailand.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, what was the group working on? Was it on the
                        relief of this mass of refugees? Was it trying to do something about the
                        situation in Cambodia? It is now called Kampuchea, I believe?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: That's right. During that period it was called Kampuchea. We were doing
                    relief, and the United States Government put up a great deal of money to feed
                    and house these displaced people, and this was funneled mostly—well there were
                    two main channels of effort going on, I guess. One had to do with the agencies
                    of the UN system, principally the UN High Commissioner for Refugees, assisted,
                    by the way, by the ICRC, the International Committee of the Red Cross, which, by
                    the way, is not part of the UN system but is an international organization, and
                    UNICEF. UNICEF was very much involved.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: UNICEF, the United Nations Committee for what?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Let me see, anyway the C stands for children. And it's based in New York,
                    as you know. The other part of the effort had to do with voluntary
                    organizations, many of them—probably most of them—American, but not totally.
                    There were organizations from other countries there too, mostly based in
                    Bangkok, and a very large number of them—I don't remember the exact number now,
                    but probably upwards of a hundred at the height of this disaster—so our job was
                    to funnel out our own money to the international organizations involved and, in
                    some instances, to the voluntary organizations, like Catholic charities and
                    various other agencies in the United States that are concerned with refugees and
                    relief.</p>
                <pb facs="0071" n="Page0071"/>
                <p>The other thing that we did was to do a lot of reporting on the situation there,
                    not so much the political situation but the relief situation. And there was
                    plenty to report about. I would say that another part of our effort was
                    protection of these refugees. Now protection involved not only feeding and
                    clothing these people but also trying to do what we could to assure their
                    physical safety. These camps were very, very large places. I believe that
                    Khao-I-Dang Camp reached several hundred thousand people at its height. You can
                    imagine that in those kinds of conditions, with law and order having largely
                    broken down and with so many other social problems coming to the fore at that
                    moment, there was a good deal of lawlessness. There were many incidents in which
                    minor warlords within these camps would take them over or take over parts of
                    them, and so this was a constant problem. Probably, when we looked at it in a
                    cold blooded way, statistically, even though there were murders in the camps,
                    there were other kinds of violence... I remember at one point we compared this
                    to the conditions, as far as we could determine them statistically, in Thailand
                    as a whole, and they weren't as bad. That also means that Thailand was pretty
                    bad—it's murder rate, for example. But it probably also means that despite
                    appeals of alarm from a number of the organizations that worked there who saw
                    these things first hand, they were not an extraordinarily high level, given the
                    fact that in any society, including in a place like Thailand, a certain amount
                    of violence exists anywhere. But at any rate, that was one of our main problems,
                    and it was a subject of a good deal of scrutiny by our own Congress, people like
                    Steve Solarz, Democrat then from New York, and others, as well as by these
                    agencies themselves, whose job in life it was to look after refugees. So we were
                    constantly under pressure to do better, rightly so, with regard to the displaced
                    people.</p>
                <p>By the way, the distinction between a refugee and a displaced person is an
                    extremely important one here. A refugee had the opportunity to be resettled in
                    another country. He or she was a person who, according to the UN definition, had
                    suffered persecution in his country of origin, and one of the options for such a
                    person was to be resettled in another country. In part for political reasons,
                    because we had just had these waves mostly of Vietnamese refugees who had kind
                    of saturated the market for refugees in the world, and also because, I think, we
                    genuinely thought that the Cambodians would probably want to go back to Cambodia
                    and one day could go back to Cambodia. They were categorized as displaced
                    persons. This too was a constant source of friction and contention between the
                    US Government and various humanitarian groups.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were the humanitarian groups pushing for?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0072" n="Page0072"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, I wouldn't say they were all pushing with one voice, but first of
                    all, they were all pushing for the best possible treatment of the displaced
                    people—that was not in dispute—but some of them were pushing for some of them to
                    be considered as refugees, and indeed, eventually, some of them were. These
                    began to do this and to make pretty contorted distinctions among people, and
                    often kind of arbitrary ones. People who had arrived before a certain date could
                    be considered refugees; people who had arrived the next day were displaced
                    people. And so there was a certain amount of that, and that was seen as unfair,
                    as indeed, if you were one of the people involved, it probably was, and so on
                    and so on.</p>
                <p>Another thing that complicated the matter was that there were also camps for
                    Vietnamese boat people who had washed up on the shores of southern Thailand.
                    Some of them were separate camps, all by themselves, but in another instance, in
                    Site II, as it was called, which was another huge camp, maybe 100,000 people,
                    there was an enclave (inside of Site II) of Vietnamese refugees. Now there is a
                    situation which is perfectly capable of exploding at any moment because the
                    Vietnamese and the Cambodians, first of all, don't like one another and,
                    secondly, the people in the Vietnamese enclave could be resettled in the United
                    States, the people in the rest of this sprawling camp could not. So there were
                    all kinds of problems. The efforts that then went on—although I just realized in
                    the describing of this I am skipping ahead probably into one of my later jobs,
                    so let me stick back with the Kampuchea Group.</p>
                <p>During that time, the effort was mostly to keep these people alive. There was, of
                    course, a political aspect to it. It had to do with the Khmer Rouge. The United
                    States was put in the very difficult position because, on the one hand, we were,
                    of course, against the Khmer Rouge because of the atrocities that they had
                    committed; on the other hand, they were the enemy of our enemy, the Vietnamese.
                    They were also in charge of people. That is, they ran some camps along the
                    Thai-Cambodian border on the Cambodian side. So in many instances, at many
                    times, the question was, Do you feed the people in these camps and thereby lend
                    support, aid and comfort, to the Khmer Rouge, or do you let them starve? And
                    there were people passionately on both sides of this question. By and large, we
                    chose to feed them, and then, of course, our adversaries accused us of coddling
                    the Khmer Rouge, which they regarded as a terrible thing to do. So that was a
                    constant leitmotif throughout this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any signs that the Khmer Rouge had begun to
                        accept the responsibilities of power?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0073" n="Page0073"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: I wouldn't put it that way, but one has to ask, who is they? The Khmer
                    Rouge was always a very shadowy group of people, and it's probably a little too
                    much to think that they had, let us say, a government in exile and ministers and
                    all that kind of apparatus, although I think sometimes they did have people who
                    were called those, but these were people out living in the most primitive
                    conditions in camps that they had set up and that they were defending. So it
                    takes a kind of leap of imagination to think of them as a government.
                    Nonetheless, your question is a good one, and it added to the ambiguity of the
                    situation, because sometimes it did appear as though the people in these camps
                    were being modestly well treated by the Khmer Rouge running the camps, despite
                    their atrocious past. So that, as I say, lent some more ambiguity to the
                    situation.</p>
                <p>One of the litmus tests that was often applied to this situation was whether the
                    people living in the camps, ordinary people, wanted to escape and whether they
                    would escape if they could. And sometimes, observing the situation, one came up
                    with one answer and sometimes in another camp with another answer. But that too,
                    if you had a situation where people were not trying to flee and where they did
                    seem to be getting the aid that was being sent there, that lent support to the
                    arguments of the people who said, “We can't let these people starve. We ought to
                    feed them like other people.”</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the parts of Cambodia that had been taken over
                        by the Vietnamese? How were things being done there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I'm not sure I can answer that any more with much enlightenment. There
                    were, of course, vast parts of the country that were in the hands of the
                    Vietnamese. One of the constant questions during that two- or three- year period
                    was how much rice and other foods, but mostly rice, can the Cambodians grow for
                    themselves, and therefore, how much has to be provided by the international
                    community? This, by the way, brings up another point of contention: should the
                    international community, with our help or with our acquiescence, be feeding
                    people in the interior of Cambodia, who, after all, were being ruled by the
                    Vietnamese, who were our adversaries? And there were people in our Congress and
                    elsewhere who said no, we should not be. As I remember it, we certainly
                    acquiesced in the deliveries of rice to the interior of Cambodia and I think we
                    paid for a certain amount of it. But to get back to what I was saying, one of
                    the efforts was to try to cut down on the amount that was needed from the
                    international community by encouraging the growing of rice inside Cambodia. This
                    was in large part in the hands of the FAO, the Food and Agriculture
                    Organization, based in Rome, which had a big role in the interior of Cambodia.
                    So they had to deal, of course, with the Vietnamese, who were running the place,
                    as well as with the Cambodians, and that effort, as I remember it, had a certain
                    amount of success.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your role particularly in this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0074" n="Page0074"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, I was the director of the Kampuchea Working Group. We probably had,
                    at any given time, maybe eight or ten people attached to us, some of them
                    Foreign Service officers, some of them AID people, and it was a group that was
                    constantly shifting and changing in its composition as people came and went.
                    There was a group in New York of the international agencies and organizations,
                    which was headed for a while by Sir Robert Jackson and of which UNICEF was a
                    lead agency, and it was an effort to coordinate the activities of all the
                    players, particularly the large international organizations. And they had
                    pledging conferences and they had other kinds of meetings in New York, so one of
                    our efforts was to follow these meetings very closely, be in touch with all the
                    people involved, go to the meetings, report on them for the State Department and
                    other agencies of our government—that was one of the things that we did. We also
                    did the same kind of thing with regard to the voluntary agencies, which had
                    their own organization in New York, of which Julia Taft was the head for a
                    while, in fact, recently, I think. So we would sometimes go to their meetings.
                    During the course of this, I made trips to Thailand, trips to Rome, to
                    Geneva—not a large number I don't think—because people or agencies in those
                    places were all involved in this effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with the Thais with this mass of
                        people on their borders?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Difficult. The Thais, before I went to Thailand, which I did later, I was
                    given a very good piece of advice by one of my teachers of Thai here at FSI, who
                    was not a very good teacher of Thai, but he did leave me this one piece of
                    wisdom. He said, “Don't forget when you get to Thailand that whatever you do to
                    a Thai he will do back twice to you. If you are nice to him, he will be twice as
                    nice to you, and if you are not nice to him...” The Thais can be extremely
                    gracious, normally are extremely gracious. They have the best hotels in the
                    world, I believe, for that reason, because they have this tremendous capacity
                    for service and for making one feel good. At the same time, they have a very
                    dark side, as is attested to by their murder rate, which is very, very high.
                    That by way of introduction. The Thais, of course, did not want Cambodians on
                    their soil, let alone Vietnamese on their soil. They made that extremely well
                    known to us. We, on the other hand, for humanitarian and other reasons, wanted
                    these people taken care of, and the only option that we saw was for them to be
                    taken care of in Thailand. So we had to try to reach an agreement with the Thai
                    Government for this to happen. And it did happen, albeit fairly grudgingly by
                    the Thais. The Thais were very fond of being sanctimonious about all they were
                    doing, and in some cases that may have been justified, but for the most part we
                    were spending, of course, a very large amount of money in Thailand to take care
                    of these people, and the Thai, on the other hand, were constantly setting up
                    regulations which wreaked hardship on the people involved, not to mention the
                    various kinds of chicanery and corruption that would normally go on in any kind
                    of a situation like that and which did, indeed, go on in Thailand.</p>
                <pb facs="0075" n="Page0075"/>
                <p>So, for example, none of the displaced people was ever allowed to leave the camp,
                    and if such a person did, if he were found wandering around alone in
                    Thailand—which happened from time to time—he was put in jail. And I've been to
                    that jail in Bangkok, and believe me, it's not a nice place to be. And the Thai
                    were pretty unrelenting about this. And we were often involved, for one reason
                    or another, in trying to get somebody out of one of these jails or trying to
                    convince the Thai to treat the people more leniently. Sometimes this was because
                    such a person had a defender in the US Congress who wrote to us about him or her
                    or for some similar reason we got drawn into it. So we were constantly talking
                    to the Thai about better treatment for these displaced people and Vietnamese
                    refugees.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, while you were doing this, and particularly dealing
                        with the Thais, there had to be an end plan. In other words, you had the
                        Vietnamese, who were sort of our enemies, suddenly controlling most of the
                        country. You had this amorphous group the Khmer Rouge, which were beyond the
                        pale for any civilized party to deal with. And in a way no particular end in
                        sight. And then you had these refugees and displaced people sitting in
                        Thailand and also straddling the border. This sounds as open-ended as one
                        can get.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, that's what the Thais thought. And by the way, your question has
                    just reminded me. There was another curiosity ascribed to the Thai treatment of
                    these people, and that was that, on the one hand, the Thai wanted people to be
                    resettled because they wanted them out of there in any ways they could; on the
                    other hand, they knew that if the Cambodians started to be resettled in the
                    United States, this would attract vast new numbers of people into Thailand in
                    hopes of being resettled to the United States. So in the end, when you netted it
                    all out, they were very much against resettlement in the United States for the
                    Cambodians.</p>
                <p>But you asked about the end game. I guess the end game in our minds was what, in
                    fact, eventually happened, ten years or so later, which was that we always
                    looked forward to the day when conditions in Cambodia would change sufficiently
                    to allow these people to go back. Actually, I was gone from this by the time
                    that eventually happened, and I think that when it did happen there was not too
                    much controversy. I think people did, in fact, filter back into Cambodia, not
                    only filter back but were taken back and assisted within Cambodia by the
                    international organizations in a fairly peaceful way. Now a lot of other things
                    more violent have happened since then, but I think at the time that that
                    happened it was not so contested.</p>
                <pb facs="0076" n="Page0076"/>
                <p>By the way, I've totally forgotten to mention another huge group of refugees—this
                    time—who were in Thailand, and those were the Lao, up along the Lao border,
                    large, large numbers of them as well who had fled in 1975, when the Vietnamese
                    took over all of Indochina, and were still there. And there was a different
                    wrinkle with them still, and that was that there was a great deal of sympathy
                    for the Lao, particularly for the Hmong, which is a mountain tribe of Lao, who
                    are different ethnically from the so-called lowland Lao, and who worked very
                    closely with our Special Forces and others during the Vietnam War. And we felt
                    that we owed them, as indeed, we did. And so we regarded them as refugees,
                    capable of being resettled in the United States. The only problem was they
                    didn't want to be refugees. They wanted to go back to Laos, by and large. Now
                    many of them did come to the United States, and that was one of the problems
                    because I guess they tended to write back the truth to the people in the camps,
                    which was that they were having a difficult time. And so for years, people sat
                    in those camps who could easily have been interviewed by the INS and gone to the
                    United States. And this, too, became a subject of contention with the Thai
                    Government: when are these people going to leave?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling—again we're talking '80-'81—about the
                        Vietnamese occupation of Cambodia, that this was a sometime thing, or how
                        did you figure that was going to play out at the time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I guess we thought it was a sometime thing, in the sense that the
                    Vietnamese would gradually draw back some of their troops, but I imagine—I'm
                    guessing a little bit now—that we thought that the Vietnamese would do
                    everything they could to maintain a heavy influence over whatever government
                    there was in Cambodia.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there any reaching out with the Vietnamese occupiers
                        and their collaborators in Cambodia with us or with any of the refugee
                        groups in our dealings?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I'm sure they were always trying to put on their best face for the
                    international organizations and the voluntary agencies who worked in Cambodia. I
                    don't think there's any doubt about that. I don't remember any instances where
                    they could have been said to reach out to us. I think we were fairly implacable
                    adversaries at that time and regarded as beyond the pale, although I might be
                    wrong and there might have been instances where some probe was made.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about our embassy in Bangkok? I imagine that, in a
                        way, they weren't very happy with the situation and you might have caught
                        some of the brunt of the thing, of, you know, “You're screwing up our normal
                        relations with this interesting country.”</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0077" n="Page0077"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: This came later, I would say. During the period that I'm talking about
                    now, Mort Abramowitz was our ambassador. Abramowitz was a decided partisan of
                    the displaced people. There was no doubt where Abramowitz stood, and in fact, it
                    was he who sounded the alarm to mobilize the US Government to do something about
                    this human tragedy in the beginning. So it would be interesting to talk to him
                    about this, but he was certainly regarded as a decided defender of the interests
                    of these displaced people and, I presume, must therefore have been looked at
                    with a good deal of suspicion by the Thai Government at the time.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How about in Congress? You mentioned Steve Solarz. Were
                        there others? Steve Solarz, as far as I know—I've been interviewing him and
                        he's been off to Cambodia all the time—he's involved with the Pol Pot
                        matter.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Even now?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find dealing with Congress? Were you being
                        called upon to testify and that sort of thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I don't think I ever testified, although other people did that I wrote
                    testimony for. And I talked to a lot of staffers. People like Solarz who felt
                    very strongly that the United States had a humanitarian responsibility toward
                    the people in these camps in Thailand, as well as others of them, although I
                    haven't thought about this for a while, but there were a number of congressional
                    delegations, particularly later, when I was in Thailand, who went to Thailand.
                    I'm trying to think of somebody who would have been on the other side of this.
                    It's hard to be against helping refugees, but I would say there were people—this
                    might bear some more thought—who were not involved in this issue, and then there
                    were people, like Solarz, who were very much involved in trying to get the
                    United States to be a part of this humanitarian effort.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who did you report to and where did you fit in in the
                        State Department apparatus?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I reported to the refugee bureau, although we had a lot to do also with
                    the East Asia bureau. In fact, specifically I reported to a deputy assistant
                    secretary who was, at least, I think, for most of that time, Shep Lowman.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find it within the Department? You know we've
                        been so involved in Vietnam. This is five or six years after the fall of
                        Vietnam. Was there a tendency to say, “God, I wish this would go away,” or
                        did you find an engaged State Department ?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0078" n="Page0078"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, by that time, of course, although this was a big problem, it was by
                    no means the biggest problem in the State Department . It wasn't the Vietnam
                    War. As I say, the East Asia bureau was very much involved in this, particularly
                    in the person of one of its deputy assistant secretaries at the time, who was
                    John Negroponte, so I would say that within the refugee bureau this was a very
                    large item. Up on the Seventh Floor, I doubt that it loomed nearly that
                    large.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when you left this job in 1981, how did you see the
                        thing standing? Did you see this as an open-ended problem, or did you see
                        that there was a handle on it, did you feel?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, again, to be honest, I don't remember what I thought, but as I look
                    back on it, I think that we did have a lot of success. I was talking a few
                    months ago in New York with one of the UNICEF officials that was very much
                    involved in this. His name is Paul Altesman. And Paul at that time was a young
                    aide to Jim Grant. Jim Grant was the very much beloved and very competent head
                    of UNICEF during these years. And Paul was saying that from his point of view
                    and his institution's point of view this whole effort was a tremendous success.
                    When you think of the enormity of the job involved and even though it often
                    didn't look like it at the time, to have received all these hundreds of
                    thousands of people from three countries eventually into Thailand, taken care of
                    them by and large, and then had them return either to their own countries or to
                    third countries over however many years it was, eight or ten years probably, was
                    really an effort that everybody involved in it could take pride in.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then in '81 where did you go?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: In '81, I went to the IO bureau, International Organizations, to be the
                    deputy director of IO/UNP, which is UN political affairs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were doing this from '81 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I'm not sure when I left there exactly because I went sideways within the
                    bureau to be the executive assistant to the assistant secretary, and I stayed
                    there for about nine months to a year and then I went back briefly to IO/UNP,
                    and then, in the beginning of 1984, I became the office director for UNESCO, the
                    office that handled UNESCO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So we might as well treat IO as a block. When did you
                        leave that, UNESCO.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I left at the end of 1984, the beginning of 1985.</p>
                <p>
                    <pb facs="0079" n="Page0079"/>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So, really, '81 to '85. First, with this political
                        affairs, this should have been a very interesting time. The Reagan
                        Administration had come in avowedly suspicious if not hostile to the United
                        Nations. How did you find it? You there were sort of at the beginning of all
                        that, Jeane Kirkpatrick.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, it was indeed hostile to the United Nations, very hostile, and I was
                    reminded of that only a few months ago when I served during the most recent
                    General Assembly as the senior advisor for Latin America and the Caribbean to
                    our delegation. You know, each of the bureaus has a senior officer who goes up
                    there for the General Assembly to help out. I went for ARA. This is, of course,
                    a Democratic administration. Our representative to the UN is Bill Richardson,
                    and so I was able to compare the atmosphere that exists now at US/UN to the
                    atmosphere that existed then, and believe me, there was a world of difference.
                    The problems are, by and large, the same. That is, we're trying to persuade the
                    UN to get its house in order, to contain its budgets, to do away with the silly
                    committees, to stop arguing over the past and get on with things, and so on and
                    so on—very similar problems, but totally different atmosphere. On the one hand,
                    in the Kirkpatrick era, you had a number of right-wing ideologues—some of them
                    pretty competent, I'm not saying they weren't—but people who arrived at their
                    jobs with the idea that this is an awful organization and what can we do... The
                    idea, I think, was not so much to make it better as it was to expose what was
                    wrong and to punish the organizations and the people involved. That was on the
                    one hand. Now, what you have, I think, are people who see the same problems but
                    are fundamentally in favor of the United Nations, who get very exasperated with
                    it sometimes, but who want to see it succeed—a big difference.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, tell me, when you were dealing with political
                        affairs in the United Nations, what did that encompass?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I was involved, in large part, with backing up our delegation to the
                    United Nations, our mission to the United Nations, doing research on various
                    questions, getting cleared positions from the State Department when questions
                    arose at the United Nations for which there had to be a government-wide
                    decisions. Now this brings up another facet of things, because Jeane
                    Kirkpatrick, as you may remember, was no wilting violet.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0080" n="Page0080"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: And you have a built-in bureaucratic problem with our permanent
                    representative to the United Nations, ever since, I guess, Adlai Stevenson, and
                    that is that, being a cabinet member, he or she far outranks the person who
                    would normally be his or her boss, which is the assistant secretary for
                    international organization affairs, and this was maybe doubly so during the
                    Kirkpatrick years because she, on the one hand, was a star and a very powerful
                    person, with a powerful mind and powerful views. And the assistant secretary for
                    international organization affairs—I guess there were several. One was Elliot
                    Abrams, who didn't stay very long and left. The other for most of the time there
                    was Greg Newell, who was a bit of a phenomenon himself, in that he was,
                    certainly on paper, not at all fitted for the job or probably for any job in the
                    State Department. He had been and advance person for President Reagan. He was
                    liked over at the White House, and by sheer force of his ability to maneuver and
                    his personality, he got himself named assistant secretary for international
                    organization affairs, a very controversial appointment. He was not a highly
                    educated man, although he was a man with a lot of street smarts. He was a
                    Mormon, which was very evident, which he was very proud of and from which he
                    drew a lot of his inner strength, I think. He had a lot of people who didn't
                    like him. There's no doubt that he, along with the others, had a right-wing
                    agenda. But at any rate, I was talking about the relationship between the two,
                    and there is no doubt who overshadowed whom.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I take it you were sort of like an executive secretary for
                        the UN business, I mean, getting the papers cleared, getting research done,
                        and that sort of thing. Was that a fair description?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, well, I was executive assistant, and I used to travel with Greg
                    Newell, whom I liked a lot, still like. And Newell had a series of, I think,
                    five goals that he constantly reiterated for the bureau, which he made up
                    hastily as he took his job and which, I guess, weren't too bad, saving money and
                    that kind of thing. People got a little tired of hearing them, but I suppose
                    they might have done some good. I was going to tell you something else that I
                    had remembered. I can't think right now. But he did the usual things that a new
                    assistant secretary would do. He traveled around to his various posts, Vienna,
                    Rome and so on.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: did you have the feeling that so much depends, for an
                        assistant secretary on how their fellow assistant secretaries and others
                        judge them, and I would assume he would be judged lacking.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: That's probably true. Again, I haven't thought about this for a while. He
                    could display a lot of strength sometimes, and I remember in one instance... I'm
                    jumping ahead a little bit now to my job as the head of the office that handled
                    UNESCO. Shall we do that? Shall we start to talk about that?</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's stay back a little bit. As a regular Foreign Service
                        officer, seeing a powerful person like Jeane Kirkpatrick coming in, who had
                        an agenda which was really going off if not 180 at least a 90? angle from
                        sort of what had been a normal support of the United Nations, maybe somewhat
                        lukewarm but certainly not antagonistic, and you have a Foreign Service that
                        is basically committed to the course that's been gone over for 34 years. How
                        did this play out. I mean, was this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, it was a problem, and it was a problem in a lot of the bureaus.
                    Naturally, people who tended to work in the International Organizations Bureau
                    are people who like international organizations, particularly the civil servants
                    and others who have been there for a long time. And of course, they looked upon
                    this very negatively or with a lot of foreboding. And in turn, they were looked
                    on with a great deal of suspicion. They were looked on as the enemies. And in
                    this, by the way, is another, I think, facet of that kind of era which you don't
                    see now. Of course, now you have people who are partisan, but you don't have
                    people—I don't' think—going around looking for enemies who are on a different
                    wavelength than they are. You certainly did then. I remember Greg Newell brought
                    in a guy, whose name I can't remember right now, who was a kind of a sometime
                    academic ideologue and turned him loose in the bureau. And he was enormously
                    unpopular, partly because of his extreme views, partly because he was just
                    regarded as dangerous by the people who were in the bureau, including me. And
                    one never quite knew what he was going to come up with next. We only knew it
                    would be bad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you say “'turned loose in the bureau.” What did this
                        mean?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: As I recall it, he was attached to Newell himself, and his job—I presume
                    he must have had different tasks as he went along, although they were pretty
                    amorphous—would be to... He was a speechwriter, for one thing, and he and I
                    would often be pitted against one another. I would write a speech; he would
                    rewrite it, and I would try to rewrite it again. So this was certainly a source
                    of tension. And he did this with other people, too. I mean that was one of the
                    things that he did. He wrote things for Newell.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, the guts of the United Nations operation are votes,
                        aren't they. Was there a radically different voting pattern, or not? Did you
                        see that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Do you mean on our part?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0082" n="Page0082"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: That's a good question. I don't know. I would expect not radically
                    different because there were so many set pieces in the UN repertoire, say in the
                    General Assembly, which come up every year, which we always vote against, and
                    which we're always going to be isolated on. And I think that probably didn't
                    change much. There were probably some different votes along the margin, but you
                    asked an interesting question. It would be interesting to compare the two in
                    black and white and see. But, you know, you say that they were the guts of the
                    organization, and that's true in a sense, but they leave out much more than they
                    reveal about any country's participation in the UN. This was brought home to me
                    a few months ago when I was in New York and I was looking at the voting records
                    on say the ten most important votes in our view to come up at the UN last year
                    and looking at the ways in which our adversaries voted, as opposed to the way
                    our friends voted. There was practically no difference, very little difference.
                    You might have—I'm making this example up, but—you might have had, say, France
                    or Germany voting with us seven out of the ten times and one of our worst
                    adversaries voting with us only five out of the ten times. So that doesn't
                    really do it, as far as explaining what various countries' roles were in the UN
                    and how they viewed it, what they thought, and anything else. They're only a
                    very crude and not very reliable indicator.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you have any feeling at the time about the effect of
                        Jeane Kirkpatrick, who did reflect the President, Ronald Reagan, so she was
                        not a wild card; she was solidly supported by the President. Did you see any
                        effect to America's influence in the United Nations? Did it make any
                        effect?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: It's hard for me to answer that because I was not there before, so I
                    can't give you a before and after picture. I know that she was regarded as,
                    let's say, a lot of the other countries found her personally difficult to deal
                    with, not for very good reason, I don't think. I think a lot, frankly, because
                    she was a woman. And, in fact, when I went around to different countries—I made
                    a tour through Africa one year, to try to gain support for our positions at the
                    UN in advance of the General Assembly, as we do every year—and sitting down with
                    various foreign ministries, that came up several times, that they were offended
                    at being lectured to by a woman or at being treated by a woman in the same way
                    that they probably would not have taken offense at being treated by a man. So I
                    think there was some doubt. Whether this reduced our influence at the UN, I
                    don't know. This is such a hard thing to judge. For example, just to make a
                    comparison, we now have in Bill Richardson and the team under him people who are
                    probably as supportive of the UN as any group of people you will find. They're
                    having a hell of time up there because of the position our country has taken on
                    its arrears. People love Bill Richardson; they hate our position. So he has a
                    very difficult row to hoe up there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any issues that were joined during this period
                        that particularly struck you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0083" n="Page0083"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: The Falklands War occurred during this period, which had us having to
                    choose between Argentina and Great Britain, and of course, we chose Britain. And
                    that didn't help our relations with the Argentines and, I guess, elsewhere in
                    Latin American.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did it really, though? I'm just wondering because the
                        Argentineans were not at all popular in Latin America. They had to make
                        official statements, you know—they were supporting their fellow Latin
                        Americans—but they probably, I understand, many of them, did not wish the
                        Argentineans well, as people and as a government.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I'm sure that's right, yes. I think it complicated our relations; I don't
                    think it did them terrible damage, because the traditional view of the
                    Argentines is exactly that—which I think is attenuated a great deal now, but I
                    think it was so then.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the other bureaus? Were they coming to you?
                        Where did the power flow? Were you—through the UN apparatus—telling them to
                        get the government of Great Britain to get on the stick and vote our way, or
                        were they telling us how we should? I mean, how did you feel about
                        power?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, in general, the bureau had very little power; Jeane Kirkpatrick had
                    a lot of power. I can remember once being up there when Kirkpatrick and her
                    lieutenants, Lichtenstein and Sorzano... I don't remember where we were or what
                    the forum was, but I remember well that all of them got some kind of directive
                    from the State Department. Of course, anything from the State Department is
                    signed by the Secretary of State, who was Haig, I think, at that time. And so it
                    was a “Vote this way. Haig” And one of these political appointees had the
                    insight, “This is not from Haig; this is from some crummy bureaucrat deep in the
                    IO bureau. We don't have to do this.” And that became their attitude. It was
                    kind of a revealing moment when they finally figured out that they weren't being
                    instructed by the Secretary of State, they were being instructed by Joe Blow
                    down in the basement, figuratively, of the IO bureau, and why should they do
                    that?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you sort of sitting back waiting to find out how our
                        delegate was going to vote on issues that were more peripheral so we had
                        opinions but they weren't these set pieces?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I don't remember, but I think we knew most of the time how they would
                    vote, and I suspect that often the word flowed the other way. That is, it was
                    clear that Kirkpatrick and company wanted to vote or to way something—that's
                    more likely where you would have a difference of opinion, in the way a statement
                    was worded—and that became the way it was done.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, one of the most famous sentences to come out of the UN during those
                    years, one of the most popular sentences with the American people, by the
                    way.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I don't know. I don't think it was planned. As far as I remember,
                    Lichtenstein was interviewed and he came up with that. But I don't know whether
                    they thought about that in advance. They probably thought about what line to
                    take. I forget the exact incident, but it was one which they must have talked
                    about back at US/UN and decided how to handle.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you moved over to UNICEF, what were you doing
                        there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, now, I was not at UNICEF. Oh, I'm sorry, you mean UNESCO.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: UNESCO, I'm sorry, excuse me.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, there, that was a very difficult year because that was the year in
                    which we left UNESCO. At the beginning of that year, we said, if you don't do X
                    and Y within this year, we are leaving, and at the end of that year, we left. So
                    it was a unique period, one in which I don't think we covered ourselves with
                    glory, one where we might well have made the wrong decision, and one which was
                    heavily freighted politically. There's no doubt that Greg Newell saw that as an
                    achievement. The whole right wing of the Reagan Government saw it as an
                    achievement. We finally left an international organization. There's no doubt in
                    my mind that Greg wanted to do that and that it would have taken a miracle on
                    the part of UNESCO to have prevented it. Now having said that, I don't mean to
                    imply that I thought there was nothing wrong with UNESCO. I think it was clear
                    that there were a lot of flaws in the organization. The biggest flaw was in its
                    leadership. It was led by a Senegalese by the name of M'bow, who ran it like a
                    warlord and was acknowledged privately to be a huge part of the problem. We
                    never wanted to say that because we were afraid of charges of racism, and so we
                    had the curious situation where we were constantly talking about things that
                    were not the real reason why the organization was not being run well. They were
                    perhaps symptoms, but not the causes, although the counter-argument to that was,
                    “Well, everybody knew what we meant.”</p>

                        M'bow was one of the problems and the major problem. I think this was in the

                <p>WRIGHT: A lot of this, I guess, comes down to whether you think that, if you
                    belong to an international organization and there's something about it you don't
                    like, you should get in it and try to change it or you should say “to hell with
                    you” and get out of it and save some money. And I think that what happened was
                    that you had a number of people in the department who wanted to stay in UNESCO.
                    I think that was surely true of Jerry—I can't think of his name, but he had been
                    our ambassador in Geneva and is now a high-level aide to, I think, Mike
                    Armacost. Armacost was, I guess, the Under Secretary for Political Affairs. I
                    think Armacost was probably in favor of staying in UNESCO, but I guess it wasn't
                    important enough for anybody to take on in the face of what was clearly a White
                    House and Republican effort to do this.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, sometimes in political life you throw some
                        non-essential raw meat to the lions in order to get on with other business,
                        and you have a feeling that this almost was that.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Could be. I hadn't thought of it in those terms, but it would be
                    interesting to look at the other things that were going on at that time and see
                    if that might fit that description.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was UNESCO doing at that time, and what were you
                        seeing as UNESCO as an instrument for doing what it should be doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, first of all, it's a terribly amorphous organization. It's the UN
                    Educational, Scientific and Communications Organization, so it's a perfect haven
                    for fuzzy-headed people who kind of like to do good and have somebody else pay
                    for it. At the same time, it did have some parts of it that did good work. There
                    were some scientific programs, I think, that were regarded as good, but there
                    were some things in it that we took terrible umbrage at. One of them had to do
                    with its attitude and policy towards journalism, which, as I remember it, had
                    pretty much defended “managed news” and news which would play up the development
                    objectives of Third-World governments and call them journalism. We, rightly,
                    were very much against that, and when that part of the organization met we had
                    terrible fights with the people who were the majority—and should have.</p>
                <p>I'm sorry, I've lost the—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: No, I was saying what were some of the things we were
                        concerned with? The journalism one was a major issue.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0086" n="Page0086"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: We were also concerned at the way the place was managed. We felt that far
                    too much money was being spent at headquarters rather than in the field. We
                    thought that there was much too much centralization. We thought there was much
                    too much power in the hands of the director general to name cronies, people who
                    were not well qualified for their jobs—that kind of thing.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you there at the dissolution?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Oh, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were you yourself or others going around, America, saying
                        the sky really is going to fall, this is going to happen? I mean, did it
                        make any difference?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: No, well, oh, sure. I think everyone understood that we were very
                    serious, and in the end we did an assessment. I've lost all the details on this,
                    I'm afraid, but we told the organization and all the members that they have to
                    satisfy these various criteria and make progress in these various areas, and in
                    the end they didn't. It's a tricky question because, on the one hand, we
                    certainly sobered everybody up by doing this, and it was probably a close call.
                    Again, I think it probably comes down to whether you think, in an organization
                    like this, you should stay and try to be better or say “the heck with you” and
                    throw them to the wolves. And then, of course, a few other people left also. I
                    think the British left the following year and I forget who else—one or two other
                    countries left.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the feeling? That there was no way of getting

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes. I 'm trying to remember when his last elections was. Of course,
                    eventually he did leave, and that was, I guess, looked upon hopefully by people
                    who hoped we would come back. We didn't, although I think within the Clinton
                    Administration there has been a lot of positive feeling about UNESCO and about
                    our going back. I guess the problem now is finding the money to do it and not
                    having any really strong partisans for going back.</p>

                        Thai?</hi>
                </p>

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Thai is not a terribly difficult language, at least if you know
                    Vietnamese. They're both similar. They're both tonal languages. The writing in
                    Thai is difficult, but speaking is about the same level of difficulty as
                    Vietnamese. That doesn't mean it's easy, but you know from the start pretty much
                    that it's doable. My problem was that I never had enough. I only had a certain
                    number of weeks of Thai. That's certainly not enough. I was also pretty unhappy
                    with the Thai instruction at FSI—they're all gone now, so I can talk about
                    them—due to the teachers, the Thai teachers that we had, who were not very good.
                    They had some common failings, but they were particularly bad in teachers. One,
                    for example, spent most of his time impressing his class with his excellent
                    English, which didn't do me much good since I already knew English and didn't
                    need to learn any more. In retrospect, I wish I had really complained about the
                    situation, because I did not learn as much Thai as I could have had things been
                    different. And then when I go to Thailand, as usual in an embassy, I found
                    myself dealing overwhelmingly with people who already spoke English, and being
                    in the capital, being in the embassy, even though I tried hard, I never really
                    advanced very far in Thai, which is a shame.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were in Thailand from when to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: From about June of 1985 until about June of 1987.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you fit in. I mean, what was your title and what
                        were you doing?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0088" n="Page0088"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: My title when I first arrived was coordinator for refugee affairs, and
                    then it got transmuted along the way to be counselor for refugee affairs. And I
                    was in charge of all of the refugee programs, except for the ODP program, the
                    Orderly Departure Program, from Vietnam, which was a separate entity, but when I
                    left, my job and the head of ODP were combined into a single job, but that was
                    not until I left. My job was to handle, first of all, all of the refugees and
                    displaced persons who were in Thailand that we talked about before. I had
                    another program under me which was the anti-piracy program, which in terms of
                    manpower and money was a small program compared to the others but which was a
                    very important one and one in which we had a lot of success, not very much due
                    to me but due to the fact that we had—I believe he was—a US Customs officer—was
                    it Customs or another agency? At any rate, he was terrific. Oh, he was DEA,
                    excuse me. We had a DEA officer who had been in Thailand before, spoke excellent
                    Thai, really knew what he was doing and, I think, single-handedly greatly
                    reduced piracy against Vietnamese boat people. These were terrible atrocities
                    when they occurred. And he did that by very successfully enlisting the
                    cooperation of the police in southern Thailand and successfully prosecuting some
                    of these pirates when they returned to land, which had never been done before.
                    So when these guys saw that there were real consequences to raping and killing
                    people out in the middle of the sea, they tended to stop doing it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You mentioned before you were in Thailand working with the
                        Thai navy, which you found a very mixed bag. The first man you dealt with
                        was fine; the second one didn't give it much priority. Was the navy element
                        still part of this, or was it more catching them when they got to
                        shore?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I don't remember the instances that you're talking about.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Yes, I may be conflating yours with Dick Gibson. I'm
                        sorry. I was talking about Dick Gibson, who was doing that, and I've got the
                        two together. On your part, how did you find the navy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I didn't deal very much directly with the navy, probably not at all, but
                    I think the answer to your question —and, of course, the guy that I'm talking
                    about did, as well as with the police—is about the same as you would get if you
                    were talking about any Third-World governmental entity like that. A great deal
                    depends upon the personal rapport that you can establish with them, and this guy
                    was able to do that and he spent many an evening out drinking with these guys
                    and getting to know them and establishing trust with them. And he did it, they
                    say, with a lot of success. And I think that's usually the key. When you're
                    dealing with many Third-World officials, trying to appeal to their sense of
                    doing a good job is usually not the best way to go. You have to get to know
                    them, and they have to get to like you, and when you ask them to do something
                    then it becomes one friend asking another, and that's the way you get things
                    done often.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You'd been dealing with the Cambodian-Vietnamese problems
                        for some time. Where did the Thai Government come down on refugees in '85?
                        I'm sure it had gone through several permutations.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: They were, I think, suffering from compassion fatigue by that juncture,
                    not that they had ever had too much compassion for the Vietnamese, but I think I
                    addressed this earlier, and I don't think things changed too much. The Thai
                    Government never liked the Vietnamese, were always worried that not only the
                    Vietnamese but these other people would stay in their territory indefinitely,
                    and that, above all, was what they wanted to avoid. They did not generally share
                    our humanitarian concern about these people, although they protested that they
                    did, and what they really wanted was to make sure that they got something out of
                    it as long as those people were there and that they all eventually went home.
                    That led them to adopt rather austere policies when it came to the care and the
                    feeding and the housing of these refugees and displaced people. As I think I've
                    said before, none of them were ever allowed out of their camps, even though in
                    some instances, particularly with the Lao, local accommodations were reached.
                    And this broke down somewhat, and people actually did go out to a certain degree
                    and have jobs in the local area outside and then come back to the camps at
                    night, and in fact, for the Lao, who were so akin to the Thai, linguistically
                    and in other ways, we used to envision that maybe this was the way it would all
                    end. Gradually these people would seep out, and eventually they'd all settle up
                    there in northern Thailand and so on and so on. That never quite happened, but I
                    guess it happened to some degree. But the Thai, as I say, wanted nothing more
                    than for all these people eventually to leave, and they wanted to be assured
                    that that was going to happen.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about boat people? Now we're talking about seven
                        years or so, after the fall of South Vietnam and all. Was it a fairly steady
                        flow out, and who were they?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0090" n="Page0090"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, there were still plenty of boat people coming out. I can't give you
                    the numbers now. They would be diminished, of course, compared with those who
                    came out first, but there were still people landing by boat in Thailand. And in
                    fact, one of the things that we were always on the lookout for and concerned
                    about was that these people not be pushed away by local people when they tried
                    to land, which would have been a violation of the Geneva agreement on refugees.
                    When people did land like that, they were taken immediately to one of the two or
                    three Vietnamese camps and had to stay there until it could be determined what
                    would happen to them. And by that I mean, they would be seen, first of all, by
                    the JVA, our Joint Volunteer Agency, which would do up a little dossier on them,
                    and then they would be seen by the INS, and the INS would decide whether they
                    were “real” refugees, that is, people who had fled because of a real fear of
                    persecution, or whether they had left for some other reason, such as for
                    economic reasons, to gain a better life somewhere else. Needless to say, the
                    line between these two was very murky, so it really came down in very many
                    instances to a pretty subjective decision by the INS officers, which itself was
                    a source of a huge amount of tension. At any rate, that's what happened to
                    people, and many of the Vietnamese did go on to the United States after that,
                    and a number of them stayed for years and years in those camps and were
                    eventually involuntarily repatriated to Vietnam.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: On my interview that I referred to before with Dick
                        Gibson, which was an ongoing one right now, and I can't remember his time
                        frame, but it was about that time, he was saying that they had done a sort
                        of an informal look at who the refugees were and came to the conclusion that
                        a significant number were what would be called “economic” refugees, but he
                        said that he had a great deal of heat from the embassy and from the NGO's,
                        non-governmental organizations, who were concerned with it. He said, in a
                        way, using a good Asian term, that he was breaking their rice bowl by doing
                        this, and he was told to cut it out. Could you talk about how this was
                        reflected where you were? I'm sure it was a continuing thing.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, this was a continuing thing, and you had the predictable people
                    lined up generally on either side of that issue. The INS people, particularly,
                    and the Thais on one side, and the voluntary organizations, most of the people
                    in the refugee bureau and the State Department on the other side—very difficult
                    to try to be objective here or to try to figure out what were the proper
                    criteria to use. For example, one of the things that a lot of people thought was
                    if a person risked his life to come out, even if he had done that for so-called
                    economic reasons, it would have been dangerous to send him back to Vietnam
                    because of what he had done. So the line was far from clear; on the other hand,
                    you had people who clearly saw things one way and one way only, and they were on
                    both sides. I'll never forget, for example, I was out in the field once and
                    observing the interviewing of a young Vietnamese man, probably 20 years old or
                    so, maybe younger, and he was being interviewed by a very sympathetic JVA
                    person, a young lady. And in these interviews, one of the ideas was to prepare
                    them for the INS interview, which was the important one; and one of the
                    accusations sometimes was that the JVA people would coach the applicant to say
                    the right things. In listening to this interview, it went something like
                    this:</p>
                <pb facs="0091" n="Page0091"/>
                <p>Well, why did you leave Vietnam? Well, I left because it was really very hard to
                    live there and I was unhappy. Well, would you say that you were persecuted? Were
                    you afraid for your life? Well, no. Well, were you unable to get a job because
                    of your association with the previous regime? No, I wouldn't say so. Well, were
                    your parents unable to work, or were they put in re-education camps? No. Well,
                    were you nonetheless worried about your family and what might happen to them?
                    No, I wouldn't say so.</p>
                <p>And finally this poor girl got exasperated, and she said, “Well, then, why did
                    you leave Vietnam?” And this kid came up with a brilliant answer. He said, “You
                    don't think I was going to wait around for all those things to happen to me, do
                    you?” But, of course, for these poor people, this was desperately serious
                    business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of course it was. In your job were you feeling any
                        pressure from Washington, particularly from the Department bureau of refugee
                        affairs or from the embassy to take one line or another?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: You had various people and institutions that had predictable lines, and
                    you were always weaving around them. It was pretty hard to be objective,
                    although if I had it to do over again, I would have tried even harder to be
                    objective. For example, the DCM at the embassy, who was my boss, Chas Freeman,
                    took a fairly hard line. He believed that this refugee business could only last
                    for so long and that many of the people coming out were economic refugees, and
                    that was his view of things. The INS, who was very hard to deal with and with
                    whom I did not get along very well, kind of went up and down. They were always
                    reading the tea leaves—and doing it kind of cynically, I think—and would
                    routinely engage in trades. “Well, okay, look: you lay off of us up in this camp
                    and let us do our work, because we think that we know what's going on there and
                    we're going to be kind of tough, and we'll do something for you down here.” And
                    it was just about that explicit. And when I think about it, it's really awfully
                    cynical, and I wish I'd said more about it at the time; but everybody kind of
                    played that game.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, I have to point out that I was in the refugee relief
                        program in Germany, in Frankfurt, in 1955, and the INS was out there, too,
                        and we traded bodies. “We're not going to fight you on this one if you let
                        this one go.”</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Right, right, I believe it.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: There was a rough justice.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0092" n="Page0092"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, and a lot of people took the view that it was better to do that and
                    get something, if you were on that side of the question, than to get the whole
                    INS mad at you and have them retreat into a funk, in which they would then tend
                    to deny everybody. I got into a dust-up with the INS in fairly short order over
                    a matter that had become a real issue, and here we're talking about the
                    arbitrariness of this whole effort. A certain number of the initial Cambodians
                    who had come across in the wake of the Vietnamese invasion, if I remember them
                    correctly, were liable for resettlement in a third country. I'm a little vague
                    on this; now I'll have to remember more when I listen to this. But there were
                    some thousands of them who had been interviewed, and some had been allowed to go
                    to the United States. Most others had not. There were a number of people,
                    voluntary agencies and others, who had taken up the cause of these people and
                    who felt that they had been treated very unfairly, and that many more of them
                    should have qualified for admission to the United States. We had a name for
                    these refugees, and I can't remember what it was right now. At any rate, I
                    brought up this issue and agitated for their being re-interviewed. Now needless
                    to say, the INS thought this was the world's most terrible idea, but eventually
                    it happened, and maybe about 3,000 of them were re-interviewed, and I believe
                    that most of them were still rejected, but about 10 per cent were accepted, and
                    those 300 or so people then did go to the United States. But I did serious
                    damage, in this, to my relations with the INS, and particularly with the then
                    INS director, from which I never really recovered. And if I had it to do over
                    again, I might try to do the same thing, but I would do it much more carefully
                    and in a different way.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find the—I want to call it non-governmental
                        organizations. They had a different name then.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, let's see. You're right, and I can't quite remember what it was,
                    but they had a whole umbrella organization there to try to bring some
                    coordination into the work of these hundred or so voluntary agencies.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were they running across the spectrum as far as how they
                        dealt with the refugees, or were they for the most part, they thought their
                        job was to take the refugees and place them in some friendly country?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0093" n="Page0093"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Not necessarily all of them, although I think that's what they tended to
                    think. You know, in the refugee world, as you probably know, when you're a
                    refugee, there are three possibilities for you. You can either go back to your
                    own country, which in refugee lore is always regarded as the best solution for
                    everybody—that is, you can go back to your country when conditions there change.
                    You can stay in the country to which you have fled, assuming you've been
                    accepted there and they agree to keep you. Or, and this is regarded by those
                    who've studied this question as the worst solution, you can be accepted into a
                    third country. Now often from the refugee's point of view that's the best
                    solution, particularly if the third country is the United States, so... I would
                    say that, first of all, staying in Thailand under the conditions I've described
                    was not thought of, except in the case of the Lao probably, as a long term
                    solution. So I guess things were divided between those who thought they ought to
                    wait and go back to Cambodia, in the case of the Cambodians, which was the US
                    Government position, and those who thought they should be resettled in third
                    countries, principally the United States. And I would think that 90 per cent of
                    the voluntary agency people would have felt that that was right, although I
                    think there were a number of them who did not think that because, after all,
                    there were problems in going to the United States, too, not only problems of the
                    US absorbing them but also problems of resettlement and adjustment to a new
                    country. That particularly turned out to be the case with the Hmong, the
                    highland Lao, who had a very difficult time adapting to life in this country,
                    and you may remember 10 or 15 years ago or so a number of them died mysteriously
                    from ailments that no one ever clearly explained.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there efforts that you were aware of, because you had
                        the UN and everybody—this was not just limited to the United States—to work
                        with now the united Vietnamese Government to try to resettle the refugees,
                        bring them back?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I think that was later. I don't believe that any of those kinds of
                    efforts occurred until some years later. There were accords, and eventually a
                    number of people did go back. I used the word involuntarily before—that's a very
                    nasty word in the refugee world—certainly reluctantly. I guess when it's really
                    involuntary that means you're taken bound hand and foot into the plane, and I
                    don't know that that happened, but certainly people were put under a lot of
                    pressure to go back. That is, they were told, “You can either stay and rot in
                    this terrible camp in Thailand for the rest of your life, or you can go back to
                    Vietnam.” And under those circumstances, a number of people did. I think that
                    the history of their treatment back there, though, as far as I can tell, was not
                    too bad. Although there again you had terrible arguments between the people who
                    believed the worst about the Vietnamese Government and the people who looked on
                    them a little more benignly and felt that this was the right solution.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, a certain number, that's right.</p>
                <pb facs="0094" n="Page0094"/>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you find this, because I would think that you, as
                        a senior officer, had been around the block, knew there was the job to be
                        done, but for particularly a younger officer, they can get emotionally
                        involved, and in their eyes, you're part of the problem, or something. Did
                        you run across this?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I don't think that was too much of a problem, partly because some of the
                    younger officers were not as emotionally involved in this as you might think.
                    They had not been in the Vietnam War. To them it was a job. And I kind of think
                    it was—it's an interesting questions, I've never thought about this before—more
                    akin to what you would find in any country to which you sent junior officers to
                    be consular officers. Some of them are sympathetic to the applicants, but many
                    of them are not.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, in 1985. Yes.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: So I was wondering, did your wife get involved, being

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, she did. She got involved in taking things, supplies and gifts, to
                    the camps, particularly to the Vietnamese, and more than that, she got involved
                    in visiting the Vietnamese who were unfortunate enough to find themselves in
                    Suan Plu Prison in Bangkok, which is where the Vietnamese and others were taken
                    who had been detained by the police outside the camps. I told you about that. So
                    these were people who were often very sad cases, people who were even more
                    unfortunate than the people who were in the camps. They desperately needed some
                    supplies and needed to be cheered up a little bit. So she did a lot of that and
                    went a fair number of times to that prison.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was the ambassador in '85-'87 period?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Let me think a second. Bill Brown.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did he have a particular set of ideas towards refugees, or
                        was he involved in other things. How did he react to this?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0095" n="Page0095"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: I believe that Brown, who was a very fine man, was personally concerned
                    about the refugees, but he also found himself in that familiar dilemma. The more
                    one, as an American official, the more one supported and tried to make life
                    better for the refugees and displaced persons, the more one got into a position
                    of conflict with the Thai Government. So his struggle was to figure out where to
                    place this among his priorities, and he fell afoul of some of the refugee
                    advocates by appearing to put refugees in a lower priority among the issues
                    which we had to take up with the Thai Government than they would have liked.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: This was sort of the high Reagan period in the United
                        States, the middle of the second term. Was there anything coming out of the
                        White House or from Congress that you had to listen to the winds from that
                        direction?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I would say no, in this sense, that I think the refugee question kind of
                    cut across party lines, in the sense that, for example, most of the refugees in
                    this country now are Republicans. They're not refugees any more. Most of the
                    people who came here are Republicans; they're not Democrats, although many are,
                    but I would say the majority are Republicans. I'm not sure I can think of many
                    instances right now, but I think it's fair to say that you had people on the
                    right who regarded these refugees as people who had escaped from a Communist
                    country, who wanted to come to our country and work hard and make a new life,
                    and found that very sympathetic. So it would certainly be far from true to
                    depict the republicans as against the refugees.</p>

                <p>WRIGHT: One of the features of our makeup at the embassy was that you had the
                    JVA, the Joint Voluntary Agency, which was a very strange creature, which we
                    duplicated in the various countries, like Malaysia, Indonesia, where we had
                    refugee operations in Southeast Asia. It was headed by one of the voluntary
                    agencies, and that agency would have a kind of contract with the State
                    Department to help look after the refugee population in that country, mostly by,
                    as I say, interviewing them when they came out, preparing them for their INS
                    interview. Because there was so much emotion and feeling with regard to
                    refugees, I guess, and because these were organizations that tended to be in the
                    refugee business, they did not want to be near employees of the US Government
                    and successfully argued, at a certain point when these relationships were being
                    formulated, that they have some autonomy. They were contractors. They were paid
                    for by the U.S. Government—all their salaries and everything else were paid
                    for—and yet they were able to have a relationship in which the person to whom
                    they reported couldn't just tell them what to do. So it was a very tricky
                    relationship, and in some ways not a very good one. It probably generally worked
                    because they and the refugee bureau people who supervised them (in quotes) were
                    generally of the same mind about refugees. They were in favor of treating them
                    as well as they could and generally in favor of admitting them to the United
                    States. But it could and did create problems from time to time because from time
                    to time the head of the JVA would sort of let it be known that he didn't work
                    for you. By virtue of the agreement between his agency and the United States
                    Government, he enjoyed a certain amount of autonomy. So when it came to the
                    interviewing of the refugees for admittance to the United States, you really had
                    three entities who were in a kind of uneasy relationship with one another. You
                    had the people who worked for the U.S. Government, like me; you had the JVA; and
                    you had the INS. You had the situation, for example, in Thailand where from time
                    to time you'd have a kind of unholy alliance between the head of the JVA and the
                    head of the INS, who were cutting deals with one another, and with the U.S.
                    Government person certainly not having much authority over the INS—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you say the U.S. Government, of course, INS was part
                        of the—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, I shouldn't have used the word US Government. I should say State
                    Department. The State Department person certainly not being able to control the
                    INS and not really being able to control the JVA either. So it was a job that
                    called for a great deal of diplomacy and managerial ability and all that. And
                    again, if I had it to do over, there are a lot of things I would do
                    differently.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: For example.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0097" n="Page0097"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: I think, for one thing, I would have gotten off to a different
                    relationship with the INS. It would still not have been easy, because the INS
                    officials were difficult people to do this with, and one had a tendency to bend
                    over backwards to be friendly with them, sort of to get them on your side, and
                    that sometimes worked, sometimes didn't work. So I think the trick would have
                    been, in general, to be as nice as possible to them in one's personal relations
                    but at the same time as tough as you thought you could be with regard to the
                    policy and try to make those two tracks run. As I say, my relations with them
                    were greatly complicated over this initial business about the re-interviewing of
                    the Cambodians.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you left there in '87.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: '87, yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And has there been any particular change by that time, the

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Again, I don't know the numbers, but I would think that during that time
                    the flow would have gradually diminished. There was still a trickle of people
                    coming out of Cambodia, but not very many; and I guess there was a trickle of
                    people escaping the camps and going back in, but not very many. One of the
                    things—and I guess I mentioned this before, but I might again because it was a
                    big problem—the security situation in the camps was something that we spent a
                    huge amount of time on, trying to bring more law and order into the camps,
                    working often with the Thais, which was not easy because the Thais tended either
                    to let people fight it out—that's kind of a guess, I probably shouldn't say
                    that, but there tended to be a lot of latitude given to the Thais who were
                    running these camps, and sometimes these were good people, and sometimes they
                    were not so good, and they had a lot of power. So this was a constant concern.
                    We were always trying to figure out better ways to do this so that people could
                    live more secure lives. I think that that gradually improved, although it was
                    something that we were constantly concerned about.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: No, it was not a place that I would have ever thought of going, but I had
                    a heck of a time finding a job that I wanted—in fact, I didn't find a job that I
                    wanted—and this came up and kind of looked like the thing that best appealed to
                    what I was used to doing, and so I took it. I remember that there were a couple
                    of other things at the time. One was going back to the anti-terrorism
                    coordinator's office, which I thought about and decided not to do. One was I was
                    offered a chance to stay in Bangkok at the embassy and be the narcotics
                    coordinator—he was leaving—and I decided not to do that. So I went to
                    Mexico.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, obviously it didn't last. What happened?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: The reason it didn't last is because I got a better offer, and after I'd
                    been there for nine months or so, a cable came out from ARA, the Latin America
                    bureau, advertising a suddenly vacant DCM-ship in Trinidad. And the DCM was
                    Roger Gamble, who called me in and said, “Would you like to apply for this?” And
                    so I did. Several other people, I think, at our mission did, and I suppose that
                    maybe a total of 10 people or so from our hemisphere responded, and I got that
                    job.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Let's talk a little bit about the time. What was your view
                        of our embassy in Mexico. I mean this was a whole new world for you. How did
                        you find the diplomatic effort there, from your perspective?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0099" n="Page0099"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, it was a huge embassy, first of all, and that was one feature. Our
                    relations with Mexico, of course, have always been tricky and sensitive. Our
                    ambassador at that point was a man named Charles Pilliod, who had been the head
                    of either Goodyear or B. F. Goodrich—Goodyear, I think—tough guy, a guy who made
                    no pretense of trying to regard the embassy as a family or even get to know very
                    many people. His method of management was to get to know four or five people in
                    the embassy and talk to them and they'd talk to other people. At the same time,
                    he was a guy who, I expect, took his job very seriously, didn't spend half his
                    time away at the beaches or anything like that. He worked hard. Although he
                    became known as probably a bit too much of an advocate for the Mexican
                    Government, he in fact was awfully tough on them, and I seem to remember that he
                    routinely picked up the phone and talked to the foreign minister and gave him
                    hell about one thing or another—in a fairly nice way, but still. So he was a
                    tough guy. I'm trying to think of some of the issues that were between us at the
                    time. You still had the aftermath of the Camarena case, Kiki Camarena, the DEA
                    agent who was murdered in Guadalajara. That's still poisoning our relations. We
                    still had a big drug effort. And then all the other stresses and strains that we
                    normally have.</p>
                <p>So it was a pretty hardworking place. In the political section, the political
                    counselor was a guy named Andy Tongs, who was a good guy, hard worker. We had a
                    section of about six or seven people, so I supervised about four people under
                    Andy. We had a very large consular section, as you can imagine, a lot of junior
                    officers, and one of the things that I did there and which I became successful
                    at, was to involve our consular officers in political reporting. Most of them
                    were anxious to do this, so we would figure out projects which they were to do,
                    and they would do them with a little bit of help from me, and then we would send
                    out their effort. And a number of them, four or five of them probably, did this
                    and did it very well. It's kind of interesting comparing this with my time in
                    Brazil, when the attitude of junior officers, at least in our experience there,
                    seemed to have changed. The ambassador at one point went down—this was only two
                    years ago—to visit Rio, which has a horrible visa load—it's probably the third
                    or fourth visa-issuing post in the world; S�o Paolo is one notch above
                    it—suggesting that the junior officers, as part of their professional
                    development, might want in their spare time to do some reporting. And he said
                    they looked at him like he was crazy. And their attitude was, “Forget it. I'm
                    going home and going to bed” Or going home and doing something else. Which could
                    be a kind of shift in the demeanor of junior officers, who may now tend to see
                    their job more as a job, less as a calling or vocation. On the other hand, the
                    people in Brazil, junior officers who did this kind of work, really had a
                    terribly difficult job to do, so we mustn't be too hard on them. But I would
                    imagine that working in the consular section in Mexico was no cakewalk
                    either.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was your particular slice of the political section
                        pie?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0100" n="Page0100"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: I guess I probably had just about everything, not that I did everything
                    but that the people that I supervised did everything. One of the things that
                    happened while I was there was the election of President Salinas, so we were in
                    charge of reporting on the elections. We didn't report on them very well, I must
                    say, because we really underestimated the public dissatisfaction.</p>
                <p>The PRI, as I'm sure you know— I think it's called the Institutional
                    Revolutionary Party or something like that—but at any rate, it's by far the
                    largest party in Mexico and the one that's run things for many, many decades and
                    thought by most people to be tired and corrupt and so on, but very much in
                    power. And every president came from the PRI, including Salinas. Salinas was
                    very much our guy in the sense that we certainly didn't intervene in any
                    elections in any way, but we felt that he was a good modern person, an
                    economist, a younger man, who would be good for Mexico. And then, of course, we
                    stepped out of the way. What happened was that he almost didn't win the
                    election, despite the massive support behind him, and may well have lost the
                    election. He barely squeaked by in the end with something a little bit over 50
                    per cent, which was an unheard-of total for a PRI candidate to get. They usually
                    got 80 or 90 per cent, I would think.</p>
                <p>And this was interesting. Well, a couple of things were interesting. As we
                    reported during the course of the election, I would say we were under a certain
                    amount of pressure from Ambassador Pilliod to report that the PRI was doing
                    okay, doing pretty well, and I remember that every day as I came to work—I used
                    to take a taxi to work—I would ask the taxi driver, who was always different,
                    who he was going to vote for. I don't believe anyone ever said he was going to
                    vote for Salinas. Maybe one did. Now I should have taken this as indicative of
                    something, but I think I though, and most of us thought, well, when push comes
                    to shove, yes, the other guys will get some points, get some votes, but the PRI
                    still has such a massive apparatus that this won't make a whole lot of
                    difference. Well, what happened was this. The Mexican Government had new
                    election computers for this election, so they were saying for the election that,
                    by gosh, by the night of the election people will have the results. Well, the
                    night of the election came—no results. The next day dawned—no results. Evening
                    fell—no results. Next day happened—no results. And it became clear from our
                    sources that the PRI was in pandemonium over there trying to figure out what to
                    do about these horrible results that were coming in. And eventually, as I said,
                    when they were announced, Salinas had won by a little bit over 50 per cent, but
                    I think it doesn't take a Rhodes Scholar to speculate that maybe he didn't win
                    at all. And then, the rest is history, as we say.</p>

                        would win one way or another, and it was such a predictable thing? Have we
                        gotten lazy at sort of getting down and looking at the system?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0101" n="Page0101"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: I don't remember. There certainly were polls, and I can't remember now
                    what they were. I think I'm right in saying that I don't think any poll
                    predicted what in fact happened, although I might be wrong. I really don't
                    remember. And I don't know that any of our consulates predicted anything
                    differently. I do remember that our USIS officer in charge, whose name was Sally
                    Grooms, who in fact there became Sally Grooms Cowal—she got married there—and
                    was a very bright officer, questioned this at the time, said, “Are you sure
                    we're really right here?” So her instincts were good, as they usually were. By
                    the way, at the same time, when we did report what we felt about the situation,
                    we got a certain amount of unhappiness down from the Ambassador, who thought
                    that even though we were not depicting the situation as badly as it turned out
                    for Salinas, he thought we were being, as it was, too pessimistic, and not being
                    a wilting violet, he let that be known.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Why do you think the Ambassador had taken this stand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I think he probably genuinely shared the perception that I just described
                    as that of many of us, that is, that, yes, there was a lot of criticism of
                    government, but when push came to shove, when people actually voted, the PRI
                    apparatus was so strong that the results would be predictable. He probably felt
                    that, and then he probably also felt that if we report differently we're going
                    to get everybody excited in Washington. One, we'll get them excited, and two,
                    we'll probably turn out to be wrong. I imagine both of those things were in his
                    mind.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Now was there ever any debate at all anywhere about, say,
                        saying the election may have been won by fraud. You know, in other countries
                        we might have raised this subject. Was this sort of a no-no?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: No. It's an interesting questions, isn't it? I don't believe it ever
                    occurred to anybody to have a US official stand up and wonder aloud whether
                    these elections were fair or not. At the same time, I think it was perfectly
                    evident to anybody with half a brain that the elections might have been
                    fraudulent.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: It is interesting, because in lots of other countries we
                        would have been in the forefront of questioning.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, and I think that had the question been raised, the answer from our
                    government would have been crystal clear: No, we are not going to stand up and
                    say this—first of all, because the guy who one was a guy who we thought would be
                    good for Mexico—that's number one—and secondly, to have done that would have
                    introduced into our relations with Mexico and into our relations with the
                    government which was surely going to run Mexico for the next six years an
                    intolerable discord.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, then, off to Trinidad. You were in Trinidad from '88
                        to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Let me just say one thing about Mexico. I regret that we didn't spend
                    more time in Mexico because it's such an important country for us. There too, I
                    wish I had had more time to get to learn Spanish well. I did travel a bit around
                    the country, which was very interesting, but I wish I had been able to spend
                    more time there. At the same time, for my wife, Jackie, the pollution there was
                    a big problem.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: A very big problem, not so much for me, but for many people it was.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: And the height.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: And the height. And by the way, during the time that we were there—and
                    this was 10 years ago—many embassies had special provisions for their employees
                    because of the pollution. Some embassies did not send people with children
                    there. Some embassies gave people off one day a week—various things like
                    that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I was wondering also, here you were, the odd man out, not
                        an ARA specialist, all of a sudden put into the political section of our
                        most important country in Latin America. I was wondering whether you felt a
                        little bit out of it, and also at the same time had a certain amount of
                        questions because here was an important election and essentially the embassy
                        got it wrong, which makes you wonder, you know, what sort of club am I
                        getting into? Did you have any of those feelings, either exclusion or
                        wondering what this was all about?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Exclusion, I don't think so. I got along very amicably with all the
                    people that I worked with there. Of course, I was relatively unfamiliar with the
                    scene there, needless to say, but I worked hard, and I think I caught up to a
                    large degree, and I think by the time I left I was pretty conversant with the
                    situation, the parties, the politics and so on. The fact that we did not do as
                    well as we could have, predicting the winner of the election, is certainly
                    something I noticed, although I think almost everybody was taken by surprise. I
                    don't recall that there was any finger-pointing at the end, although it was a
                    good lesson, and one lesson is that you need to not just go by the past but be
                    prepared for things to change.</p>

                <pb facs="0103" n="Page0103"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were in Trinidad from '88 to when?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: '91.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: The Ambassador there was—</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: —Charles Gargano. He was the person who hired me. In fact, before I got
                    the job, I was invited back to talk to him, and I was invited back by Gene
                    Scassa. Gene was then the executive director in ARA. Gene very much helped me
                    get that job, I think, because he took a look at all the bidders, and Gargano
                    trusted him a lot, liked him, I think, and Gene said—I think he said this, he
                    told me— “Well, you ought to take Lacy Wright.” So he invited me back, we had a
                    talk, and he said yes.</p>
                <p>So then I went out. I actually got to Trinidad a few days before he did, and the
                    former Ambassador had already left. It was being run by a charg�, Bob Dickerson.
                    And so I overlapped a few days with Dickerson, and then he left and Gargano
                    arrived.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was Gargano's background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Gargano was a head of a New York City construction company. He had done
                    very well. He was also active in Republican politics. He had been deputy
                    secretary of transportation—I guess it must have been under Reagan—for a while
                    and then gone back to New York. Subsequently, after Trinidad, he was the head of
                    the New York State committee to re-elect the President, on behalf of President
                    Bush, who, of course, did not win. I'm sure he was active in the campaign to
                    elect Governor Pataki, and today he's one of Pataki's closest advisers, and he
                    is the head of the Empire State Development Corporation, which is the New York
                    State economic development arm.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: When you arrived in Trinidad in 1988, what was the
                        situation there? How would you describe the political-economic
                        situation?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: In 1988, the NAR Party—I can't remember what the acronym stands for—was
                    in power. The NAR Party in the last election had obliterated the party which had
                    been in power for many years, the PNM, the People's Nationalist Movement.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: That was Eric Williams's party?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: That was Eric Williams's party, that's right, which was a black party.
                    Trinidad, as you may know, comprises two principal ethnic groups, the Indians
                    and the blacks, each of which has maybe 45 per cent or so of the population, the
                    rest comprising people of European descent, Trinidadian-Chinese descent and I
                    guess a few other odds and ends. But the big groups are the Indians and the
                    blacks. PNM is a black party; the NAR's boast and effort and achievement, for a
                    while, was to have a party which was not based solely on racial considerations
                    but represented both of the two major racial groups. The prime minister was A.
                    N. R. Robinson, who today, by the way, is the President of Trinidad.</p>
                <p>Economically, Trinidad was living in relatively hard times. Trinidad is, I guess,
                    alone among the Caribbean Islands to have oil and gas. And in their heyday—this
                    is the early '70's—Trinidad had had the third highest per capita income in the
                    hemisphere. So there was a huge amount of wealth then, which was not,
                    unfortunately, used always in the best way. For example, the Trinidadians built
                    a huge hospital complex outside of Port-of-Spain, which then when the money ran
                    out went largely unused—a horrible amount of money wasted. They tried to build a
                    medical school, to which, of course, nobody would come, and so on. But at any
                    rate, now they were living in much reduced circumstances, with the price of oil
                    having gone down dramatically in the interim. However, probably the problems
                    that they would later have with drugs had not matured. Violence was a problem,
                    but less of a problem than it became later. And all in all, Trinidad was a
                    delightful place to be, a wonderful place to be.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During this 1988-91 period, what were American
                        interests?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Drugs and commerce. We had big oil companies there. We had Amoco, which
                    drew out about half of Trinidad's oil. We had other large companies which were
                    either there or were angling to go there and drill, like Mobil. So for a very
                    small country, there was a lot of American investment in Trinidad.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern about nationalization of oil things that
                        crop up?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I think that had pretty much occurred already. You see, there are two
                    Trinidadian oil entities which had been takeovers of other companies, but that
                    was already done. I don't think any one envisioned that there would be further
                    nationalizations at that point.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Was there concern at this time about Cuba? Did Cuba play
                        any role?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0105" n="Page0105"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: I don't think particularly. I think that played a bit more of a role in
                    our relations with Jamaica later, but no, I would say not. Now the big event
                    that occurred while I was in Trinidad was the attempted coup of mid-1990, in
                    which a bunch of Black Muslims, called Muslimin, took over both the radio
                    station and the entire Parliament with the prime minister and much of his
                    cabinet inside and held them for five or six days. That was by far the most
                    dramatic event ever to have occurred in Trinidad, and it was one which really
                    shook the country to its foundations. The prime minister was brutalized during
                    this takeover. Selwyn Richardson, the minister of defense, was shot in the leg,
                    very badly treated. By the way, he was later assassinated, about two or three
                    years later. One person among the hostages died of a heart attack, but outside
                    even more damage took place. A fair amount of the downtown was burned down by
                    looters, who took advantage of the situation to wreak havoc. Overall, about 20
                    people were killed during the whole thing. So it was a very serious event, and I
                    must say that the reaction of a lot of the Trinidadians, particularly to the
                    prime minister, I found shocking. The prime minister really behaved heroically
                    during the time that this was going on. He was told at one point to go out and—I
                    think it was—to talk to the police and tell them to lay off, which he refused to
                    do. But he got no sympathy from most of the people, certainly from the common
                    people, and instead of being treated like a hero when it was all over, he was
                    simply the object of lots of criticism for various things. Probably some of this
                    had to do with his personality. He's kind of an erudite man who speaks like one.
                    There's nothing common about him at all, and this clearly worked to his
                    disadvantage as a politician. But I see that he's been rehabilitated because
                    within the last year, I think, he was elected President of Trinidad, which I was
                    happy to see.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Where were these black Muslims coming from?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: They were a very tiny sliver of the population, although I think they
                    mined a kind of rich lode of resentment among the poorer people in
                    Port-of-Spain, witness the burning down of part of the city. They had no real
                    power. They came from a group which had long been well known in Trinidad. They
                    had a kind of mosque which they had built. By they, I mean maybe a hundred or so
                    people, maybe a few followers. They had squatted on land, and the government was
                    in a constant quandary as to whether to throw them off of it. They had just
                    taken over some land that belonged to the government and built on it. And so
                    Selwyn Richardson, minister of national security, whom I've mentioned—it was his
                    job to figure out how to deal with them. And eventually, he did not throw them
                    off this land, but he made them stop building, earning their wrath.</p>
                <pb facs="0106" n="Page0106"/>
                <p>They had a bunch of grievances against the government—some of them, I guess,
                    valid, and most of them not. They way this happened, however, it could never
                    have happened had they not received guns from guess where. The United States of
                    America. They had a guy, it turned out afterwards, who was the number two person
                    in the organization. His name was Bilal, I think. He had taken a trip to Miami.
                    He had made contact with an individual who was able to get him a cache of
                    weaponry. This was sent down to Trinidad disguised as something else—this was
                    all dissected, so it was very well known at a certain point—stashed in some
                    other kind of container. There was a sympathetic customs guy who had been paid
                    off to look the other way when it came in. He did. The stuff was taken off. And
                    these were the weapons that were used in this coup.</p>
                <p>It also turned out that—this is very ironic—I think it was the FBI, one of our
                    law enforcement organizations had been onto this guy, the American party, who
                    was in Miami. They were in fact trailing him. They knew he was up to something.
                    They knew he was buying weapons. They knew he was going to do no good with them.
                    But they didn't know where he was going to send them. They knew he was going to
                    send them somewhere. But he eluded them long enough to do what he did. It also
                    turned out that the Trinidadian Government knew that this guy Bilal had gone to
                    Miami—I think this is right, I'm a little hazy on this—and had put in a request
                    to the FBI to find out who he had been meeting with. The FBI treated this, as
                    far as I can tell, as a kind of routine request. They threw it into a big hopper
                    with lots of other requests, and they finally got him an answer about a week
                    after the coup occurred. And had they done this faster, this would not have
                    occurred. And this, by the way, became an issue in the Trinidadian papers
                    afterwards. But anyway, just one more kind of dramatic example of how the
                    Americans, with their nutty penchant for having firearms, not only kill
                    themselves at a tremendous rate but export this violence to other countries as
                    well.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, when this coup took place—I mean, obviously we're
                        very sensitive to things of this nature happening in the Caribbean—was there
                        any thought that we might send experts for taking care of this matter or
                        SWAT teams or anything like that, or were we just bystanders?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: One of the things that happened was that a lot of people thought—and
                    hoped—that we would rush in and save the day. One of the things that occurred
                    was this. This happened right after the Fourth of July. And at the fourth of
                    July we had had in Trinidad the USS Eisenhower, our aircraft carrier—</p>

                <pb facs="0107" n="Page0107"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: —which was massive, and we had had our Fourth of July party on this
                    ship—which is another story I'll tell you about. There were rumors going around
                    that the USS Eisenhower had turned around and was steaming back to
                    Port-of-Spain, which, of course, was not true. There were also other rumors that
                    we had landed at the airport. There were rumors flying everywhere during this
                    period.</p>
                <p>One of the main factors in the resolution of the coup was the staunchness of the
                    Trinidadian military. Trinidad, being a small country, doesn't have a big
                    military, but it has one, and it has a regiment. Their highest ranking officer
                    is a brigadier general, who was a colonel at the time, I think, and his name was
                    Ralph Brown. And Ralph Brown deserves a huge amount of the credit for saving
                    Trinidad, and he did it by being absolutely tough, at a time when there were
                    probably people within the police who wanted to, well, let me back up. The
                    Muslimin were being communicated with all the time by the government, which had
                    set up a kind of command center, and one of the first things that they did,
                    after a day or so, was to cut off all the telephones to these guys except one.
                    First of all, they found out that these guys were calling all over the world,
                    particularly from the radio station, and talking to the newspapers and
                    everything. So anyway, since they owned the telephone system that was no
                    problem. They got in there and fixed it so the Muslimin could talk to only one
                    person, and that was the government spokesman. So that really contributed to a
                    sense of isolation on their part. Then they were still making a lot of demands,
                    and there were people who wanted to give in to some of these demands. There were
                    emissaries that went in, church people and so on. And it was Ralph Brown and his
                    troops that said, “Forget it. We are not giving in to any of these things.” And
                    since they were the guys on the Trinidadian side with the most guns, they were
                    the guys who prevailed. And in the end, Ralph Brown's message to the Muslimin
                    was, “You guys either come out and surrender, or we're going to kill you.” And
                    they thought that over for a while, and they came out and surrendered after
                    about six days.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were we looking around and seeing what this meant? I mean,
                        were we seeing any hand elsewhere, or was it pretty clear at the beginning
                        what it was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, yes and no. I think mostly it's clear it was a homegrown thing, but
                    these guys did have links to—I believe it was—Iraq. And in fact, a number of the
                    calls that went out from the radio station on the part of the Muslimin—I don't
                    think it was Iran, I think it was Iraq. So clearly, they did have links with
                    these guys. It turned out that some of the Muslimin had been there for training
                    of various kinds, so they were certainly abetted by other terrorists.</p>

                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Of '90, yes, and we're talking about after the Fourth of
                        July. But still, there were repercussions. After this was over did we get
                        involved in trying to explain the gun role and all this? I mean, did this
                        cause problems?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: It did cause problems, and it died down after a while and went away. But
                    as I recall, I think the prime minister said—I guess had to say—that he was
                    going to demand an explanation of what had happened. In fact, I remember he did
                    say that. He was going to demand an explanation of what had gone wrong in our
                    police liaison, so that flared up for a while and then went away.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, you were mentioning the visit of the Eisenhower.
                        Could you explain this? That was probably at that time our most modern
                        aircraft carrier.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0109" n="Page0109"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, this is pretty humorous. Ambassador Gargano worked very hard, as
                    ambassadors tend to do in these instances, to get the Eisenhower there so that
                    we could have our Fourth of July party on it. And he was successful, and it
                    came. It was so huge, however, that it could not dock so that it had to anchor
                    about five miles out. So you could only reach it by boat. So it came and stayed
                    for two or three days, and on one of those nights we had our Fourth of July
                    Party. In order for the guests to reach the boat, they had to be taken there, of
                    course. And so we chartered a ferry boat, the same kind of ferry boat that
                    routinely goes from Trinidad to Tobago. And you can picture these things—it has
                    some inside cabins and it would hold maybe a thousand people or so. This was the
                    event of the decade, I guess, and there was tremendous pressure to get
                    tickets—invitations, I should say—and we were besieged with people who were not
                    on the list and who wanted to be, and there was all kinds of chicanery going on,
                    people showing up without invitations, presuming they would get in anyway, which
                    they usually did. So we had an elaborate setup to take the invitations and
                    funnel people onto the boat, and all that worked pretty well. And in the
                    morning, by the way, they had had—if you'll pardon the expression—a dry run.
                    They had sent out the ferry, and it had to link up—it kind of fit in the back.
                    There was a kind of gangway that let down in back, and this had to fit into a
                    kind of slot in the boat and then people just walked right from one onto the
                    other. And they had tried this out earlier in the day, and it had worked and so
                    on. So all kinds of planning, months of planning, had gone into this, and now it
                    was working and in progress. So we all got onto the boat—all 500 or 700 people,
                    however many it was—and we were drinking and having a great time, and after
                    about 45 minutes we got out to the carrier. We could not link up with it. The
                    tides, which had obtained earlier in the day, had shifted, and so getting these
                    two to mesh with one another time after time proved impossible. So there we
                    were, all of these people out there again and again trying to do this and again
                    and again failing. By now it was getting late, of course, and one of the people
                    among the guests was the head of the port authority. It was a woman. And so at a
                    certain point she asked the Ambassador to come into her private quarters, and I
                    think I went with him. I guess I went with him. And she said, “Mr. Ambassador, I
                    think we're just going to have to give up and go back. This is awful. I'm
                    horribly embarrassed, a terrible thing, but I just don't see—I think we have to
                    give up.” And Gargano didn't let a second go by. He said, “We are not giving up.
                    We are going to have this party tonight.”</p>
                <p>And sure enough, we finally made it. It took about two hours. And one of the
                    things I remember is we finally got on there—I guess about 10 p.m. or so—on this
                    massive ship and I went up onto this massive deck where there was a band there
                    and so on. And as usual with these things, the Ambassador was supposed to say
                    something, and he had a speech that I had written for him. And a few days
                    before, President Bush had been in a certain situation with a speech, and he had
                    very dramatically torn his speech in two and said, “I'm not going to use this
                    speech. I'm going to talk to you by myself.” And that's probably what put this
                    into Gargano's mind, although it was probably a good idea. He stood up and
                    ripped up my speech and said, “We're not going to have a speech tonight.”</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how about tourism? Tourism was not much of a factor
                        in Trinidad, was it?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Not a huge factor, but it was a subject of constant debate, and the
                    debate was between those who wanted tourists and saw it as something that
                    Trinidad, for its economic well-being, ought to have, on the one hand, and on
                    the other hand, those who didn't want to do any of the things that you needed to
                    do to accommodate tourists and saw them as sullying their way of life, and all
                    that stuff. So one of the things that one heard constantly was “environmental
                    tourism.” I think a lot of people in Trinidad felt comfortable with that. They
                    thought, these are higher kinds of beings, these environmental tourists, and we
                    have what it takes to attract them, and that's the niche that we ought to be
                    trying to fill. And indeed, Trinidad does have some rare things to show people.
                    And so there was a certain amount of that, but I think that probably everyone
                    agreed, both there and later in Jamaica, that environmental tourism might be
                    nice, but people do not come in great numbers to watch birds. So there was some
                    of it.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, also, as a people, I think I've heard that
                        Trinidadians aren't terribly receptive to tourists. Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe I
                        have it mixed up with another island. I mean, it's not a warm, friendly,
                        fuzzy feeling when you get there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: That could be. The Trinidadians, on the other had, are especially when
                    compared with the Barbadians or even the Jamaicans, are a very outgoing and
                    fun-loving people. But I think you're right. Don't forget, when it comes to
                    serving tourists, there is a cultural problem here. I mean, there was slavery
                    and being black and all that. And that's not absent from this equation. So you
                    do not have, and I suppose you never will have, the kind of service in these
                    islands that one encounters, say, in Thailand, where I think they have the best
                    hotels and the best service in the world. So this is different.</p>
                <p>You know, if I could introduce a new subject, V. S. Naipaul is a Trinidadian.</p>

                    was there. He had not often come to Trinidad. In fact, he was on the outs with
                    the Trinidadians because of what he had written about them as, indeed, he is on
                    the outs with everybody about whom he writes.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Especially India. I usually conceive of the world as an ever-shrinking
                    place for V. S. Naipaul because after he writes about a place he usually can't
                    go back to it. And he's now written about a lot of places. He is regarded—I
                    guess rightly—as a man who's very full of himself, a man who—maybe takes himself
                    very seriously is a better way to put it—and who has pretty trenchant views
                    about almost everything. He's lived almost all of his life in London. He's been
                    long married, married to an English woman, a white woman, and those who know
                    him—I know some people who know him very well—say that he can be hard to take
                    sometimes. The times that I saw him, I must say, he was very gracious to me. In
                    particular, one night I was invited alone—Jackie was not there, she was out of
                    the country—to a very small dinner with Naipaul by a friend of ours by the name
                    of Grace Phelps, a black Trinidadian woman. And Grace had a dinner for about six
                    people, including V. S. Naipaul, including one of Naipaul's sisters and her
                    daughter, Naipaul's niece. There was also a guy called Selby Wooding, whose
                    father was a famous lawyer in Trinidad, a longtime friend of Naipaul, and one of
                    the former wives of—who's the guy who won the Nobel Prize from St. Lucia a few
                    years ago?</p>

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I'll think of it in a minute, but anyway, this was one of his former
                    wives. Walcott, Derek Walcott. And it was a very interesting evening. Naipaul
                    talked about a lot of things, talked about the British, talked about the
                    colonial period, talked about—who's the author who about 10 years or so ago
                    wrote a book which Muslims found offensive?</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes. Salman Rushdie.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Salman Rushdie.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: He's an Indian.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: That's right, yes. We talked about him. But I remember we talked about
                    the British and about how bad the British were during the colonial period, and
                    there were a lot of negative comments about them. And finally, Naipaul's niece,
                    who was a very young woman, maybe 20, 21, who had not said anything, piped up,
                    and she said, “Well, gosh. I don't know what you're talking about. I was in
                    London last year, and people were so nice to me, I had such a nice time.” And
                    Naipaul turned and looked at her and said, “My dear, that shows you have not
                    understood a word we have been saying to you.”</p>
                <pb facs="0112" n="Page0112"/>
                <p>Also I remember at another point, Margaret Walcott was talking about American TV
                    and what drivel it was and complaining that that's all they had to watch because
                    that's all that was shown down there. And I remember that Naipaul's sister,
                    whose name I can't think of right now, turned to her and said, “Well, stop
                    complaining. You do what I do. You turn it off.”</p>
                <p>But Naipaul also talked about Rushdie, whom he obviously detests, and he said,
                    “You know, Rushdie's not in any danger. He's not in any more danger than you or
                    I. He loves all this attention.” And apparently Rushdie had panned one of
                    Naipaul's books once, so he had that against him. He had called him a tool of
                    the CIA, I believe, than which, I guess, there is nothing worse that can be said
                    about a human being in the world.</p>

                <p>WRIGHT: Yes. Well, it was interesting that only several days after that, after
                    Naipaul had fulminated about Rushdie, Rushdie appeared in a bookstore in
                    downtown London signing copies of his books. So maybe he was right.</p>

                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I don't think so. As I say, Trinidad is a delightful place, full of
                    interesting people, interesting characters, a well educated people, as compared,
                    say, with the Jamaicans, partially because much richer, partially because, they
                    say, Eric Williams made education a priority and funneled a lot of money into
                    it. A lot of people are educated still in England, although that's changing.

                        the calypso music that during the '40's was very popular.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0113" n="Page0113"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, the Trinidadian has several kinds of music which are really
                    wonderful. First of all it has the steel band, which it invented. Trinidadians
                    invented the steel drum. It's theirs. And when you have a steel band of maybe a
                    hundred pieces, it's a marvelous thing. They have calypso, which is uniquely
                    theirs, which is great stuff, as you've said, and there are a whole new round of
                    calypso songs created every year for the carnival. And so every year it's new,
                    and every year there are some marvelous songs that come out of it. And then they
                    have “soca” music, of which the name means a combination of soul and calypso.
                    And this, too, is really unique to Trinidad, and now to the Caribbean because
                    it's spread all over there. The greatest of the calypso singers, I think, is
                    Sparrow, whose real name is, improbably, Francisco Slinger, and he is still
                    around and has been pretty much since the Second World War, and his stuff is
                    just terrific. You know, I remember at one point while we were in Trinidad, we
                    were visited by Colin Powell, who was then just leaving his job in the NSC, and
                    before he came down we sent up a cable saying is there anything particular,
                    special, that General Powell would like to do while he is here in Trinidad? And
                    we got back a message which said, “Yes, General Powell would like to buy some
                    Sparrow records.” So he certainly had heard of Sparrow.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Jamaica has often been a troubled place because some
                        political ambassadors have gone there and were sort of not quite sure what
                        an ambassador would do. I mean they were often more social than not, but
                        they were real problems. Could you describe how you got the job as a DCM and
                        who was your ambassador, and then the situation in Jamaica in 1991, and then
                        we can move on?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: I got the job primarily through the support of Sally Cowal, who was then
                    the deputy assistant secretary in ARA who was responsible for the Caribbean. She
                    recommended me to the then ambassador, whose name was Glen Holden. Holden was
                    and is a very wealthy Californian, a friend of Ronald Reagan, a friend of George
                    Bush, a man who made a fortune in insurance, and he had just lost his then DCM
                    because of disagreements between them, and so he was looking for someone new.
                    Sally recommended me. I don't know how many other applicants there were—I know
                    there were some—and I went through a long series of correspondences with Holden,
                    in which he asked me a number of questions to which I responded. The whole
                    process took several months, but in the end he accepted me as his DCM, and I
                    went there directly from Trinidad in April of 1991.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Obviously you were sounding the corridors to find out what
                        the dispute had been between the other DCM and the Ambassador, just to get a
                        feel for the situation. How would you describe that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: My gosh, it never occurred to me to wonder about that.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Ha, ha! A note to the transcriber to put down “Laughter
                        and raised eyebrows” on both our parts.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0115" n="Page0115"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, of course I looked deeply into the matter. The then DCM, whom I did
                    not know at that time but came to know later, was an economic officer, and this
                    was his first DCM-ship. I believe that several things went wrong. I believe that
                    there was not enough communication between the two. The economic officer went
                    off and did things—this is what it appears to me, I must add—which he was
                    familiar with, talking about economic policy and Jamaica's role in that and in
                    our overall economic policy toward the Caribbean, not always, it seems,
                    coordinating with the Ambassador. And I think that that was the general problem,
                    that is, there was kind of a growing rift between the two. One has to remember
                    that when you have a political ambassador, that person usually doesn't know what
                    his role is, and he doesn't know what his deputy's role is, therefore. So
                    there's a period during which those things have to get sorted out. There's also,
                    or can be, a certain amount of suspicion on the part of a political ambassador
                    vis-�-vis his DCM, who may think that he is trying to encroach on the
                    ambassador's territory. This happens all the time. And so there might have been
                    some of that. Anyway, it's unfortunate that it didn't work out for the person
                    involved, who stayed about a year and whom I have come to know later as quite a
                    good guy and a serious person. But those are the kinds of things that happen in
                    our service.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Can you talk about what was the situation vis-�-vis the
                        United States but also the political situation on the ground in Jamaica in
                        1991, when you arrived there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, you have in Jamaica a country with some serious issues with the
                    United States. You have, first of all, a number of Jamaicans who live in this
                    country, and some people are fond of saying that they are either very good or
                    very bad. There are some marvelous Jamaicans here, some of whom have become
                    famous, like Colin Powell—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Barbara Watson.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: —Barbara Watson and others, many who don't become famous but who are
                    marvelous citizens of our country. And then, at the other end of the spectrum,
                    you have a whole group of very violent criminals, who do a great deal of damage
                    in our country. So you have both. And the people at the bottom end of the
                    spectrum also cause bilateral difficulties with our country. For example, we
                    exercise our right every year to deport a number of Jamaicans back to Jamaica.
                    These are often people who are released from prison, and we put them on the
                    plane and send them back there. This, during my time there, reached a total of
                    maybe close to a thousand people a year.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, boy.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0116" n="Page0116"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: And Jamaica, under international law, has to take these people back. But
                    first of all, they don't like it, naturally, because it's causing them and their
                    society increased problems, and they sometimes accuse us of sending back people,
                    number one, who sometimes they contend are not Jamaican citizens, or who may be
                    technically Jamaican citizens but who arrived in the United States so young that
                    they were really formed in the United States and so, it is said, their criminal
                    behavior is really our fault, and not Jamaica's. That is a debate that went on
                    during the time that I was there. We once did a statistical analysis of some
                    groups of these people who were sent back, and I must say, we did not find very
                    many who arrived in the United States at age two and then became violent
                    criminals. Most of them arrived much later, although there were some who fit
                    into the first category. At any rate, this is one of the issues.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I must say, during this period of time, I was here in
                        Washington, and the papers would make reference again and again to Jamaican
                        gangs who would come in and work from New York down to Norfolk and sort of
                        up and down the Atlantic corridor. They would say “Jamaican Gangs” and then
                        you would have, you know, “Ten People in an Apartment Slaughtered.” I
                        haven't heard that much any more, but that was very much in the newspapers
                        during this particular time when you were there.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, I remember maybe one or two instances of that. I don't know that
                    that—the particular way you've described it—was a continuing feature of these
                    gangs, but there's no doubt that they exist, and there's a tremendous symbiosis
                    in travel between gangs in the US and the same gangs, with the same names, in
                    Jamaica. There's another interesting feature here, and that is that the gangs in
                    Jamaica are generally linked with one of the two political parties in Jamaica.
                    This is a feature of Jamaican political life, which it's hard for us to
                    comprehend. And I can't really think of any parallel anywhere else in the world,
                    but these over the course of the past two or three decades, Jamaican criminal
                    gangs became affiliated with one of the political parties. And one of the things
                    that pops up from time to time is one of the two most renowned Jamaican leaders
                    of the last several decades—and those are two, Edward Seaga and Michael
                    Manley—being caught in a photo somewhere, at some fund-raising event or some
                    other kind of public event, with a bunch of very dubious characters. Seaga, in
                    particular, whose constituency was, and is today, one of the most abject and
                    difficult and violence-ridden parts of Kingston, was often accused of having
                    used these gangs literally to attack partisans of the other side. And the same
                    kind of charges were made against the Manley people. So probably neither side
                    has its hands clean in this matter, and both of them are guilty of having dealt
                    with and used and accepted the violent services of these criminal gangs.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, did we try to tell the Immigration Service to cool
                        it or not to send as many, or did we sort of accept the heat from the
                        Jamaican Government?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0117" n="Page0117"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: The latter. We never tried to influence our own authorities in that way.
                    We explained to the Jamaicans as best we could why this was within our rights
                    and tried to clear up some of the misconceptions. Another problem between us, by
                    the way, similar in nature, was that of extradition. Because of the frequent
                    travel back and forth of people who committed crimes in the United States, they
                    would often end up back in Jamaica. And there were some really clamorous cases
                    of people who were extradited or whom we wanted extradited that occurred while I
                    was there. One of them—I can't think of the man's name, although I will in the
                    written record—was a man who was wanted, I believe, for murder in the United
                    States, a Jamaican. He was extradited, and no sooner was he extradited than his
                    lawyers and others popped up and said that this was done illegally, that the
                    laws of Jamaica had not been followed, and I believe that our case turned on an
                    appeal that they contended was still in progress with the Privy Council in
                    London when the removal of the person to the United States occurred. And I don't
                    remember whether this was totally clear. I remember, at the time, that we
                    believed that we were right. Well, first of all, if any mistake had occurred, it
                    would have been on the part of the Jamaican Government; it would not have been
                    on our part. So there's no question of that. But the Jamaican Government was so
                    concerned about this public accusation and about what they feared the reaction
                    was starting to be. I was charg� at the time, and I was called in by the
                    minister of national security and literally asked if we would sent him back to
                    Jamaica, which I duly transmitted to Washington, and you can imagine the
                    attitude of the Justice Department to such a request. Their response was “no
                    way, Jos�, are we sending this guy back to Jamaica.” And so this was a request
                    that was repeated to us several times over the coming weeks, that we never sent
                    back, and it faded away.</p>
                <p>Another time, or perhaps it was the same time—you know, in extradition, when a
                    requesting country asks for someone to be extradited, it must say exactly on
                    what charge, where it will be—it has to be very specific. So you can't get the
                    guy back to your country and then try him on something else, as you know. And in
                    this case, the person was then tried in another jurisdiction and for a slightly
                    different crime, and this brought protests from the Jamaicans. I believe we
                    could show that there were actually two requests made, the Jamaicans acted on
                    one, we acted on the other—again, I'm not sure if it was totally clear which
                    side was in the right and which side was in the wrong. I think, from a moral
                    point of view, there's no reason to feel sorry for the person in question.
                    Whichever count he was tried on, he richly deserved what he got. And I think the
                    Jamaicans privately were very happy to be rid of him. But again, it's one of
                    those kinds of questions that come up, behind which there's often a lot of
                    nationalistic sentiment.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Ambassador Glen Holden operate? How long was he
                        there, and how did he operate, and how did you two work together?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0118" n="Page0118"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: He was there for, I guess, almost two years while I was there. Ambassador
                    Holden first of all got off to bit of a rocky start—this was before I came on
                    the scene—but even before he arrived in Jamaica he made some remarks in a
                    speech, which I never read and really don't know the nature of, remarks that
                    were taken badly by Jamaicans. I think that he may have not been as carefully
                    talked to by the State Department during this period—that might have been part
                    of it. But at any rate, he said things which irritated them. So this meant that
                    when he arrived he had this to overcome. Another thing that he had to overcome
                    was that he was a very wealthy man, so he was susceptible to those kinds of
                    accusations, those kinds of resentments. For example, I'm told that he spent
                    about $500,000 of his own money to refurbish the residence. And he brought down
                    his own armored car, which he drove around in. So all those things were the kind
                    of things that can, if someone wants to be critical, breed criticism and
                    resentment. I would say, however, by the time that he left, he was well liked. I
                    think by then, in a number of ways, he had shown that he really was very fond of
                    Jamaica, that he was willing to put his money, both in a literal sense and in a
                    figurative sense, where his mouth was. And he had become friendly with a number
                    of important Jamaicans, including people like Michael Manley and others. And so
                    I believe that by the time he left he was appreciated. He came back once during
                    the time that I was charg�, after he had left. He was invited back by the
                    Jamaican Government when the Queen and her husband visited Jamaica. He was
                    invited back because he had made some significant donations to the restoration
                    of the governor-general's residence.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: I imagine that immigration, running the consular section
                        and all, must have been a considerable burden. In fact, this has gotten some
                        of our ambassadors into trouble, because they did not respond very well to
                        the hordes of people that came in and all. How did the immigration thing
                        work while you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, the consular section was a very busy one, very difficult job. We
                    had about a 50 per cent rejection rate, very high. We were constantly being hit
                    with various kinds of difficulties in that area. It was a difficult job for the
                    junior officers that had to do it, and there were always about 10 or so of them
                    there. They felt under a tremendous amount of pressure, particularly because
                    they sometimes had to take their work home with them, in the sense that in
                    public they would be recognized as consular officers, so that you would call
                    them up at their homes or badger them on the streets or things like this, making
                    life more unpleasant than it would have been otherwise. There were also, of
                    course, hordes of people who called various of us in the embassy, probably me
                    mostly, to get them visas, intervene on behalf of somebody.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: These were Americans who wanted, usually, servants, wasn't
                        it?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0119" n="Page0119"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: No, I wouldn't say so. I'm sure there were some of those. By the way, I
                    don't mean to imply at all that people who called us were supporting something
                    dubious. But the people who called us were often people we knew and who knew
                    also how difficult it was to get an American visa or who had been importuned by
                    somebody that wanted a visa, therefore had to be seen to be doing something for
                    them, though often they were of this nature. The applicant himself or herself,
                    his or her case might not look particularly convincing to a consular officer,
                    but the person was calling, perhaps an employer, perhaps a friend, a politician,
                    to say, “Look, I know so-and-so. I know their family. I know their situation. I
                    know they're going to come back, and here's why.” And I think when the situation
                    fits that kind of description, you ought to take it seriously, because after
                    all, what you're trying to do is not exclude everybody; what you're trying to do
                    is make the right decision. And if somebody comes along whom you trust and
                    purports to shed light on a situation that you, of course, know little about,
                    and if you trust that person, that's something that ought to be considered. So
                    it always seemed to me that these were, on the face of it, legitimate
                    interventions on the part of people that ought to be used to help make a good
                    decision.</p>
                <p>Now it's interesting—you know about this better than anybody—that you have
                    certain consular officers who are absolutely determined that nobody is going to
                    influence them, and who regard anybody's call to them, including that of the
                    Ambassador, as at least an implicit interference in their affairs. You also
                    have, however, a legitimate area for participation by other people, first of
                    all, of the kind that I've described, and secondly, I think, when a very
                    important person in the country calls you up and says this is really important
                    to me that this happen, that's something that any ambassador ought to take into
                    account. If the foreign minister calls him up and says, “Look, I don't ask you
                    for many favors, but I want one, and here's what it is,” I think that our
                    broader foreign policy interests dictate that that request be seriously
                    considered. And sometimes you have a consular officer or consuls general who
                    recognize that and sometimes they don't.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, on the consular side, was this sort of—I won't say a
                        running battle, but was this a theme that kind of ran throughout the time
                        that you were there, with these requests and the varying responses of
                        consular officers and requests and that sort of thing?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: The visa requests were certainly a constant theme. I would not say that
                    we in the front office had a lot of problems of this kind with the consular
                    people. I think that, by and large, the people who were there, both the junior
                    officers and their supervisors, had good heads on their shoulders and could tell
                    the difference between a shoddy case and one that required some extra
                    thinking.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: While we're on the consular side, what about crime and
                        protection of Americans and also the staff? Was this a problem?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0120" n="Page0120"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, there was a problem. For example, while we were there the French
                    military attach� and a visitor from France were murdered in the man's living
                    room, in his house. Terrible crime. We had, I think, three of our guards
                    murdered while I was there, including two who were actually on duty. We had some
                    very severe cases of American tourists, one in which a man alone traveling in
                    Jamaica was brutally murdered and his body weighted down and thrown into the sea
                    and very probably eaten by sharks, and having to deal with this poor man's
                    family. So these were very difficult cases, and there were two incumbents of the
                    American citizens' services job while I was there, and these poor guys had to
                    deal with the families in these kinds of situations, and they were really
                    gut-wrenching. So yes, there was a lot of crime, and it was a constant problem
                    for us.</p>
                <p>One way in which it became a problem, especially between our countries, was in
                    the issuance of what was then the “Travel Advisory.” As you know, it's since
                    been changed. But the travel advisory was something which was put out at that
                    time on an ad hoc basis and when there was reason, anywhere in the world, to
                    warn American visitors against a particular situation. And we issued a travel
                    advisory on Jamaica during that time. Again, I guess I was out of town, I think,
                    and someone else had to deal with this for about a day until I got back, but I
                    think I was nonetheless the charg� at the time. And we issued such a travel
                    advisory, and the Jamaican Government really went bonkers because Jamaica, of
                    course, depends heavily on its tourism industry for its national sustenance.
                    Jamaica's two big foreign exchange earners are bauxite and tourism, and most of
                    their foreign exchange comes from those two sources. So the government feared
                    that this would have a severe impact on their tourism, and they were highly
                    exercised about it. And they called us in and said, “How could you do this?” and
                    “Aren't we friends?” and “What are you thinking about?” and “Why didn't you tell
                    us you were going to do this?” and so on and so on. So this was a bit of a
                    mini-crisis in our relations.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, how did it work out?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: We, of course, defended our travel advisory. In those days you replaced
                    one travel advisory with another, if you wanted to, and I'll have to do some
                    more recollecting about this, but I think that after a certain period we were
                    able to soften it; but more important, I would say, our travel advisory did not
                    seem to have a big effect on the numbers of people who went to Jamaica, and I
                    think that probably both they and we overestimated the influence that a travel
                    advisory had. In fact, I would say that overall, I believe, that Jamaica, given
                    sporadically the kinds of crimes that have occurred there, and I don't want to
                    exaggerate them because they don't occur every day, but given the several
                    high-profile crimes that occurred there, has, I believe, been very lucky that
                    their tourism from the United States has not been more severely affected.</p>
                <p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: You were there during '92; Clinton was elected, and that I
                        assume had brought another political ambassador.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: That's correct. Ambassador Holden left shortly after the inauguration,
                    having stayed on a bit longer than most other ambassadors did, but no too much
                    longer, a couple of months, I think, but then, fortunately for me, it took a
                    long time to appoint another ambassador. The first person appointed was a black
                    woman politician, whose name I'll think of in a minute. It took them a while to
                    appoint her, but they did. She eventually dropped out of her own accord because,
                    she said, of her eyesight, which was not very good, and she feared that she
                    would not be up to the demands of the job. This was Shirley Chisholm, from New
                    York.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Oh, yes, a former Congressional representative.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, and I guess the first woman and the only black woman to run for her
                    party's nomination for the presidency. During this period I did come up and see
                    her once, to get to meet her. I met her at the Hyatt Hotel near the Congress,
                    where there was some kind of a black convention going on, and it was very
                    instructive for me because this diminutive woman was obviously held in huge
                    esteem by all the people there. My talk with her was interrupted constantly by
                    people coming up to her and paying their obeisance.</p>
                <p>Well, anyway, she did drop out, and then it took a very long time to appoint
                    another person, and that really surprises me. I would have thought there would
                    be no dearth of people wishing to go to Jamaica as ambassador.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did someone arrive before you left?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, and Gary Cooper, who was a black man who became the first black
                    American ambassador to Jamaica, and he arrived about six months before I
                    left.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was his background?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: It was varied. He was a Marine Corps Reserve general. He had founded and
                    run a black-owned bank in Alabama. He had been an Alabama state legislator. He
                    had been, I think, assistant secretary of the army, and I think he had another
                    Pentagon job. So he had a number of arrows in his sling. His sister is or was
                    married to Mr. Cafritz, here in Washington, a very influential and wealthy
                    family, by marriage.</p>
                <pb facs="0122" n="Page0122"/>
                <p>There were only about three or maybe four bauxite operations in Jamaica. They
                    were all large. And there were, I think, three American companies there: Kaiser,
                    Alcoa. I believe there was one Canadian company, and there was a national
                    company. And there were, therefore, some American resident managers, and there
                    were, of course, labor negotiations and labor disputes. The company's position
                    always was, in the matter of wage negotiations, that they had to pay on the
                    basis of productivity. The Jamaicans would argue that “You're paying so-and-so
                    up in Canada X amount an hour. We're producing the same stuff. You should pay us
                    the same.” The company's position always was, “Yes, but their productivity is
                    three times as great as yours.” So this was a constant battle, and needless to
                    say, these matters reached very high levels in the government because of the
                    importance nationally of the bauxite revenue.</p>
                <p>I'm trying to think of what happened in the one that I got slightly involved in.
                    It was resolved. The company didn't leave, but there were veiled threats that if
                    they couldn't reach an agreement they couldn't sustain their operation. An
                    agreement was always reached.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, now, could you talk about our dealings with the
                        government. Who was the prime minister at the time. As I recall, we had a
                        very rocky relationship with Manley, when he was in power at various times,
                        but during this time, where did we sort of stand with the various
                        leaders?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0123" n="Page0123"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, by this time, Manley was in his second prime-ministership, and he
                    was a very much changed animal. Now how much of that was a change of conviction
                    and how much of it was a tactical change, I think they were both. I think Manley
                    did change his views about socialism. I think he did become convinced that a lot
                    of aspects of socialism didn't work, that Jamaica did need foreign investment,
                    and all that, companies did need to behave like businesses, and so on. So I
                    think a lot of his thinking truly did change; on the other hand, on certain
                    things he never changed. I'm thinking primarily of his stand on Cuba. He always
                    believed that we were terribly wrong in the way that we dealt with Castro's
                    Cuba, and that never changed, even though, again, tactically, he greatly played
                    down, during his second term, Jamaica's relations with Cuba. For example, there
                    was a Cuban ambassador to Jamaica, who had a very small mission, however. There
                    was never, during Manley's time, a resident Jamaican ambassador in Cuba. They
                    had relations. There was a Jamaican ambassador, but he rarely went to Cuba, and
                    he had other duties in the foreign ministry in Kingston. There were no visits
                    between the two. I think Manley must have listened very carefully to what we
                    were saying during his campaign, and he must have taken the very calculated
                    decision that the United States is a lot more important to me than Cuba is. But
                    I can remember, I had, while I was charg�, probably two or three luncheons with
                    Manley, in which I invited him to our residence, and we had various members of
                    the country team there, five or six people, and Manley, just Manley. And I
                    remember saying to him the first time, “Mr. Manley, we thought we would make the
                    sides even here: we would have six of us and one of you.” Manley was a fantastic
                    character, though. He was, I believe, the most brilliant extemporaneous English
                    speaker that I've ever heard. He was a man with a great sense of humor, a man of
                    huge range of interests. He had written one or two books, for example, about
                    cricket. He was into everything. He was also a tremendous—legendary, I should
                    say—womanizer, who was at that time with his... In fact, he was married while I
                    was there, again, to Glynn Manley, who is now his widow. But he was larger than
                    life in many ways, and I will never forget that at one of these luncheons he
                    really unloaded on us about Cuba and about what a horrible botched up job we had
                    made of our relations with Castro.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were American interests during this time? We had the
                        end of the Bush Administration and the beginning of the Clinton
                        Administration. Did we have any major issues? I guess the whole Communist
                        thing, which was always something there earlier on, that had died. People
                        could be right, left or indifferent, and it didn't make us that much of a
                        problem at this time.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0124" n="Page0124"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, I think that's right, and rabid socialism was pretty much dead by
                    then. There really were not very many ideological differences between the
                    parties, and in fact, it's kind of interesting that Seaga, during our time
                    there, was probably more in favor of government ownership of certain parts of
                    the economy than Manley's government was. So that is true. These differences had
                    largely disappeared. One interest—not an abiding interest, but something that
                    came up all of a sudden—provided us a chance to get much closer to Jamaica, or
                    Jamaica to get much closer to us, and that was the trouble in Haiti, when we
                    forced out the leader there and reinstalled—I shouldn't use that horrible
                    word—assisted in the return of President Aristide. During that time, as you
                    remember, there was a huge outflow, out-migration, by sea of Haitians, and this
                    caused us to have to really devise a policy for dealing with this, and as you
                    may remember, we had our coast guard and navy intercept people at sea rather
                    than allowing them to come into Florida. This was a controversial policy at the
                    time, and one in which we needed both some political cover and some real help.
                    And Jamaica kind of surprisingly stepped forward. So this was by far the most
                    significant thing professionally that happened while I was there. Jamaica
                    stepped forward and agreed, first of all, to participate in the force that went
                    into Haiti in order to bring about the removal of I can't think of his name
                    now—General whatever-his-name-was. First of all, they agreed to participate;
                    they helped us a great deal in persuading other Caribbean countries to
                    participate; and they allowed us to use Kingston harbor to emplace ships to
                    interview Haitian migrants for acceptance as refugees into the United States.
                    And all of those required some heavy decision making on the part of the Jamaican
                    Governments, and so in that instance Jamaica really earned the gratitude of the
                    United States, and that was a very hectic and active time for us. I was the
                    charg� during all this period. It also meant that we had at least two visits by
                    Strobe Talbott while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Who was Under Secretary of State.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Under Secretary of State. And the whole thing there really went very
                    well, and we were, as I say, extremely grateful to the Jamaicans for their
                    assistance during this period.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: One last question that I have on this, and that is on,
                        during this time, the role of the narcotics trade.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Jamaica, first of all, grows marijuana, and so our narcotics assistance
                    unit was engaged in trying to encourage the Jamaicans to destroy marijuana and
                    assist them to do so, and we had a DEA office there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Drug Enforcement Agency.</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0125" n="Page0125"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: A Drug Enforcement Agency office, which had about three people in it,
                    which is a fairly decent-sized DEA office, and they worked with the Jamaican
                    police and the Jamaican drug squad within the police to try to catch
                    traffickers, and they did catch some. We were not very successful in seeing
                    traffickers either prosecuted or convicted in Jamaica, and this was always a
                    weak part of our efforts. We were engaged through AID in trying to assist
                    Jamaica to upgrade its court system with the idea and the hope that—well, first
                    of all it's a good thing to do in itself—but with the hope that it would assist
                    in the prosecution of drug cases. One of the problems was not so much that drug
                    cases were badly handled but that the entire system was extremely slow, was
                    cumbersome, was one in which judges routinely did not behave very forcefully, so
                    that defense lawyers had a relatively easy time of it in arguing for delays and
                    that kind of thing, which disrupted cases, from our point of view. So on that
                    score, we were not very successful. We were probably more successful in the case
                    of marijuana eradication, although that gradually became, in our overall policy,
                    less a matter of importance and urgency than stopping the cocaine trade.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, wasn't marijuana or this type of hemp called ganja
                        or something like that that played quite a role in one aspect of Jamaican
                        culture?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Oh, absolutely. Ganja is just marijuana. That's what it is. That's what
                    Jamaicans call it. Yes, and of course, you have Bob Marley. Bob Marley, by the
                    way, I think, is probably, posthumously, the best known popular musician in the
                    world. Everywhere you go, all over the world, people who've never heard of Elvis
                    Presley or the Beatles all know Bob Marley, so Marley's influence is just
                    tremendous, I think hard to exaggerate. And Marley and all of the people in that
                    culture, of course, were highly identified with marijuana, and one of the
                    results of this is that a lot of people, Americans, tourists, young people, go
                    down to Jamaica to do drugs. And I think some of them probably think that it's
                    okay to do drugs in Jamaica because of all they've heard about it, and one of
                    the things that we constantly had to deal with were a high number of Americans
                    arrested at the airport for drug possession. And the Jamaicans really went after
                    this with a lot of enthusiasm. And so at given times we had maybe a couple
                    hundred Americans, couriers, in jail in Jamaica for drug possession.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What were conditions like and how did you work it with the
                        prisoners?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0126" n="Page0126"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: I never myself visited any of these prisoners in jail. I don't think it
                    was awful. I think there were jails in Jamaica that were awful, but I don't
                    believe that these people were in them. In fact, I have the recollection now
                    that some of these people regarded being in jail for six months in Jamaica as
                    part of the cost of doing business. On the other hand, you had other really sad
                    cases of young people talked into or cajoled into being a courier, with the
                    promise of some money and a vacation in Jamaica, who ended up in jail to the
                    horrible consternation of their parents, and all kinds of efforts made to get
                    them out. We had both kinds of people. But it was clear to us that the people
                    who were running these couriers and, by the way, who were often willing to pay a
                    fine to get them out, regarded the losing some of them from time to time as one
                    of their costs of doing business.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Were there any other issues particularly during this
                        time?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Oh, we signed a bilateral investment treaty while I was there, which
                    helped out in the treatment given to American investors and companies there. Let
                    me think.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Hurricanes? Natural disasters?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: No, the great hurricane occurred about two years before I came there, and
                    that really was a disaster, and it caused a huge amount of devastation—tore the
                    roof off my house, by the way. It was all back in by the time I got there.</p>
                <p>Well, the BCCI scandal occurred while I was there.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Could you explain what the BCCI was?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, let's see. The Bank of Commerce and something International, I
                    guess. BCCI was an international bank which in about 1991 or so was discovered
                    to be involved in all kinds of fraudulent activities and over most of the world
                    was closed down, over all the world, I guess. And there was a branch in Jamaica.
                    Actually the Jamaicans claimed at the time that their BCCI bank, because of the
                    strength of their own banking system, no legitimate clients lost their money
                    because of what happened. However, about five years later, right after I had
                    left, the whole Jamaican banking system pretty much came unglued, and there was
                    a general bank scandal in Jamaica, in which it was shown that several of the
                    major banks in Jamaica had been involved in very dubious, or lax, if not
                    fraudulent, loan activities, and several banks were closed down and taken over
                    by the government. And so Jamaica has had its share now of banking problems.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did you get that job?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, by the time I left Jamaica, partially, I think, because of the
                    Haitian matter and the way that the Jamaicans and, I guess, the embassy had
                    performed, my stock was fairly high in ARA, so I think I pretty much could
                    almost have had my pick of the jobs that were open at that point. In fact, I had
                    a couple of other offers to be DCM's in embassies. What I went after, actually,
                    was not this job but was another job in Brazil, and that was consul general in
                    S�o Paolo. It turned out that the ambassador, Mel Levitsky, had really three
                    jobs which he considered to be about at the same level, and he had all of them
                    in mind when he offered me any of them, and those were consuls general in S�o
                    Paolo and Rio and the DCM-ship. Well, my chances of going to S�o Paolo went up
                    in smoke when Melissa Wells decided that she wanted to go to S�o Paolo. Melissa
                    had been ambassador a couple of times. She was, it was thought, coming to her
                    last assignment, and she decided that for family reasons—that is, her son lives
                    in S�o Paolo—that she would like to have her last post there. And once she
                    decided that, that was that. So that job vanished, but I then switched my sights
                    and I was chosen by Mel Levitsky to go there as his deputy.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What was the situation in Brazil during this two year
                        period that you were there?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, it was a pretty good situation in the sense that Fernando Enrique
                    Cardoso was, still is, president. He had been elected pretty much on the
                    strength of his plan to save the local currency, called the Real Plan, in which
                    he had founded a new currency, pegged it pretty much in the beginning to the US
                    dollar, and then did everything possible to defend it while he was minister of
                    finance, and did end the very high inflation from which Brazil had suffered for
                    a long time. So it brought that all to a stop, and that lasted, it guess, from
                    about 1993, when it started, and it's still going strong. I think inflation this
                    year in Brazil will be about seven per cent; it probably used to be about that
                    much per day.</p>
                <pb facs="0128" n="Page0128"/>
                <p>And Cardoso not only did that but he instituted a number of other economic and
                    social reforms. He himself is a man of real stature, a man who had made a career
                    for himself as an academic before becoming a politician and who is personally
                    irreproachable, who has lived in a number of countries, speaks three or four
                    different languages fluently, including English, of course, and who, for the
                    first time in a long time, maybe for the first time ever, has provided the
                    Brazilians with a president who has real respect internationally.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: How did Mel Levitsky, who's a regular Foreign Service
                        officer, use you?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: First of all, when I went there, I knew little about Brazil. I'd never
                    been there before, so I stayed, I would say, in large part within the embassy
                    and looked to the administration there. Naturally I did a certain number of
                    things outside, too, but I would say that, more than some other assignments, I
                    spent a lot of my time on administration of the embassy. Mel Levitsky, on the
                    other hand, knew all the issues between our countries backwards and forwards. He
                    didn't need any help in those areas at all. So I would say that generally that
                    was the division of labor.</p>

                        is becoming more important in contrast to Rio as a post. You, as the DCM and
                        managing it, did you see a development like that?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, I didn't see anything develop during my time there, but certainly,
                    from our point of view, yes, S�o Paolo is a more important place. Rio is still a
                    very important city, but it's one which I wouldn't call it a shell of its former
                    self, but it's lost a certain amount of the pizzazz that it had as S�o Paolo has
                    become more and more an economic powerhouse. You know, when you stop to think
                    that, I think, the state of S�o Paolo or maybe it's the city has a larger
                    economy than all of Chile, you begin to get some idea of the enormous size and
                    sophistication of that area.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, looking at Brazil, I mean, you hadn't been in Brazil
                        before, and this is the colossus to the south. But it has been going
                        through, you know, almost from the beginning, has never quite lived up to
                        what it should be. How did Brazil strike you?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0129" n="Page0129"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, what you're referring to has been captured in an aphorism, which is
                    “Brazil is the country of the future, and always will be.” I think, yes, that
                    may have changed. Probably many of the reforms that have been introduced are
                    irreversible. Privatization, for example. Just the other day, a part of Brazil's
                    national telecommunications company was auctioned off for $18.8 billion, much of
                    it to MCI, so the whole telecommunications system will probably in the end bring
                    in, I don't know, $30 or 40 billion to Brazil, and once they privatize it,
                    they'll have a terrific telecommunications system, by the way, which they
                    certainly don't have now. So that's one example of a very important
                    infrastructure area which is being transformed in Brazil to the great benefit of
                    the national treasury, as well as the citizens. So in other areas, in the
                    nuclear area, we used to regard Brazil as a kind of bad boy of South America,
                    along with Argentina, always fiddling around with things that they shouldn't be.
                    That's all a thing of the past. Human rights—there are still horrible human
                    rights travesties—travesties is not the right word—incidents in Brazil, but I'm
                    convinced that the government is serious about human rights. They have good
                    people in charge in this area in Brasilia who are very much trying to do the
                    right thing. It's going to take a while longer, but they're moving in the right
                    direction and trying very hard to cope with that situation. Probably Brazil's
                    most serious long-term problem is education. They have a very poor primary and
                    secondary educational system, but they also have a terrific minister of
                    education, who is making big changes in that area, so as you look around the
                    landscape, even though they still have very big problems—they have a horrible
                    income distribution in Brazil, which dovetails with their horrible education
                    system—all that having been said, things are moving in a very good
                    direction.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Did you find any sort of tension between the United States
                        and Brazil at this point? From time to time, for most of the time, there
                        have been—not like Mexico and the United States, but still it's this “We're
                        big, we're grand, we'll do it our way.” And it sort of put us off. How do
                        things stand?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Oh, absolutely. And I suppose the most dramatic and constant way in which
                    this manifested itself was in our consular operations, because for a while there
                    we were constantly being accused by somebody or other of unfair, biased, nasty
                    treatment at the consular window. For a while it became almost comical, and
                    these accusations of bad and unfair treatment... There are two things. One is
                    not getting your visa—that's unfair treatment because he should have gotten his
                    visa—and secondly, bad treatment, where “I not only didn't get my visa; they
                    insulted me.” And this was mixed with the racial question, because most, I
                    guess, of the people that turned up like this were black, and so we were accused
                    of being racist. Now, in a country which doesn't have a very good record, in our
                    view, with regard to racism, but which thinks it does, this was a pretty galling
                    accusation to have to face for our consular officers. So for a while there, it
                    was almost every week somebody new would pop up in the newspapers with some
                    variation of this kind of accusation. So it was a difficult period in that
                    sense.</p>

                    <hi rend="italics">Q: What about the Clinton Administration that had been in
                        power now for about three years of so, a couple of years when you got there.
                        Of course, we had problems all over the world, and I assume Latin America
                        wasn't very influential—I mean, there wasn't much interest in this in the
                        Clinton Administration. Or am I wrong?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Well, I think you're a bit wrong. For one thing, Clinton did a good thing
                    in appointing Mack McLarty as his special envoy to Latin America. McLarty did a
                    kind of low-key but, I think, effective job of going around and stroking people
                    and letting them know that they had a line through him to the White House, and I
                    think this worked. Meanwhile, the Brazilians themselves think that they have a
                    good line to the White House via a good relationship between Cardoso and
                    President Clinton. For example, President Cardoso was invited only about two
                    months ago, in June, I believe, when he was on his way to the special session on
                    drugs at the UN, to have dinner and spend the night at Camp David, supposedly
                    only the second leader in the entire Clinton Administration to have been given
                    that honor. So when I, shortly after that, talked to one of the senior people at
                    the Brazilian Embassy, he really made a point of saying how pleased they were at
                    that. So I think in political circles, the Brazilians believe that they enjoy a
                    privileged relationship with President Clinton.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: During the time you were there, did we try to use our good
                        relations with Brazil to further some policy, either world policy or Latin
                        American policy?</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: We did use these relations with Brazil in the question of the
                    Peru-Ecuador conflict. We, along with Brazil and Argentina and Chile, I
                    think—</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: 1942, I think.</hi>
                </p>
                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, it's been going on for a while, but broke into hostilities a few
                    years ago, border dispute. There are these four guarantor countries, of which we
                    and Brazil are two. So Brazil has been influential in that. On an official
                    basis, Brazil was very helpful in keeping in line the Paraguayans, about two
                    years ago, when there was question of a possible coup attempt in Paraguay by
                    General Oviedo. Paraguay, of course, is right on Brazil's border. And the
                    Brazilians let it be known to General Oviedo that they would no look kindly on a
                    coup by him or anybody else. And this was a departure for the Brazilians, which
                    like to portray themselves as very much staying out of other people's business,
                    and a very good departure, in our view.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, is there anything else we should cover, do you
                        think, in Brazil?</hi>
                </p>
                <pb facs="0131" n="Page0131"/>
                <p>WRIGHT: I will say, with regard to Ambassador Mel Levitsky, that serving with him
                    really illustrated to me in a way that nothing else ever had how singular a
                    contribution a career ambassador can make in an important country. He was, first
                    of all, a very intelligent, very tough, very knowledgeable man, but a man also
                    who knew the Department and Washington backwards and forwards. He knew how
                    embassies were supposed to work backwards and forwards and took an interest in
                    every aspect. And it's been my experience that political ambassadors, who
                    generally have been very successful people—otherwise they would not be
                    ambassadors—first of all, don't know how embassies work and are always
                    struggling to learn and tend, I think, to settle down on one or two or three or
                    five aspects of things and pretty much have to let the rest go. And so that's
                    one of the big differences in having a career ambassador. And I think that Mel
                    Levitsky performed superbly in every aspect of running a large mission like
                    this, and my only regret is that I didn't serve under somebody like that earlier
                    in my career.</p>
                <p>
                    <hi rend="italics">Q: Well, why don't we stop at this point? So I assume you
                        retired then after this.</hi>

                <p>WRIGHT: Yes, I retired after Brazil and have come back now to Washington.</p>
